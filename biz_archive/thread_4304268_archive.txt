Okay /biz/, I'm a university student studying Quantitative Finance.
My university has a competitive club that manages a portion of the school's endowment and tries to beat the S&P 500 every year, I'm a freshman now and am looking to apply fall of sophomore year, what books would you all recommend I read/ concepts to familiarize myself with in order to prepare for this?
