How do you make someone buy your shit when the price is up?
I know it's just people buying high to manipulate the price, but do I just cast a sell order around the last artificially high trade price and hope someone bites?
Or do I put a sell order down at the bottom of the list hoping for people rushing in to buy the lowest sell order?
Or do I do both and just say fuck it and throw in two sell orders at different levels?I want this coin sold
