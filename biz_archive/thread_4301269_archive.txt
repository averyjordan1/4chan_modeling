>tfw when people on here are going to miss the newest bitcoin pump: BCM (Bitcoin Monero).
This is the one true king goys, it's everything what we wanted bitcoin to be.
Not owned by Chinks, completely untraceable, doesn't fork every fucking week.
This is it.
What will you tell your kids when you miss the pump of the year?
Pump has barely started, this is like getting in BCH at $400.
Get in now you still can for a good price.
Pls no, not done accumulating
I unironically plan to start seriously SAVING wealth as monero, as I'm settled with offshore gold and irl cash.IMO, too early, giving it 4 months till it breaks the down trend for few years long where I can start the stackenin
tfw when ancap and realize monero is anti-statist
i don't like it lacks zero inflation rate tho, could you enlighten me how it works out in comparision with btc?
Dont buy monero it won't be used in time.
If you look at privacycoins look somewhere else.Nice shilling btw, seen this post a few times already today.
Good one.Monero is THE KING
