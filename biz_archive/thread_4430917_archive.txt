Okay, whats the deal with this coin?>coming down from a big pump/dump>seems like its close to where it was before/bottom>ONLY 11mil in circulation (very low)>yet, still only $1/coin>DPoS like ARK (I think)>about to release new website and roadmapWhats up with this coin?
Can anyone give me a quick rundown?
Could this give me chad-like gains?
about to release new website and roadmap
Devs are dishonest (keep promising shits but don't respect deadlines and only say at the last minute); their shit is already late by 3 months and they don't even published a white paper.
this.
Deadlines?
I can't really think of a team out there that actually gives concrete deadlines... even BTC never does that.
It's usually a guessing game, which is why crypto is so speculative to begin with.
