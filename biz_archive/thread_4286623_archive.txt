ASTRO has ~4mil tokensASTRO offers quarterly dividends based on hedgefund performanceASTRO spent ZERO dollars marketing their ICO, and raised over 5million.CEO Matt dibbs has great communication and has wall street trading experience.

The token burn will happen today or tomorrow and then it will be officially listed on ED by name.

Hadn't realised this had started trading.
A solid start.What's the math behind $0.80 dividend per share considering it's trading right now at $1.04?
Also holy shit they burned 92% of the tokens!
