Why is GVT going to be biggest gainer of month?Extremely low market cap.
I heard about this project months ago and there was a lot of hype prior to ICO.
I thought it would sell out quickly and I didn't want to take part in it.
When I found out a week ago that it raised a little more than 2 million$ I couldn't believe it.
Later I found out that they had a little problems with marketing and then after a first week or two they said that they have enough funds to build what they need, and they are going to earn money by making their app extremely profitable for both them and investors.GVT with current market cap of 3 million will be somewhere around ~380th place on coinmarketcap.Top 250: 320% profitTop 150: 860% profitTop 100: 1500% profitThat is how undervalued GVT is.
I personally think that GVT will be one of the most popular projects in our community in months to come, and that would put it way way higher in top 100, but I will be happy with whatever happens.
It is up to team to deliver and I have no doubts in them.EASY 10x
average shilling is average, someone already shilled this shitcoin today
Thanks, just bought some on ED thanks.
Thanks, just bought in.
That's a solid team and advisors, and such a low amount of coins.
Can't tell if this shilling is ironic or genuine anymore.
Same, the shilling quality is high here and it hides if this ICO is a scam or not.
Seems legit ......... Not so sure though.
Also, everyone is currently selling half their stocks at x2 so ICO buyers won't loose anyway but recent buyers could be fucked.
Mmmmm hestating really
Oh it IS shilling either way, I just can't tell if it is pajeets, or anons imitating pajeets.
Is the one with Charlie Shrem advising?
No I will not pump this scam Pajeet coin you can choke on my smelly hairy balls.
