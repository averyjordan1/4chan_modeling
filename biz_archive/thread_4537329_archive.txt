obviously there would have to be free torrents.
but they would have incentives.If you host top wanted/paying torrents and update them as needed you could effectively mine the shit out of itthey are updating.
this has been confirmed by a dev
Meh already on the holy trinity.
This will offer nothing more just another way to access (pay) for the same p2p / scene content you can get anywhere
Filesharing is a solved problem.Those who want to get things for free pirate.Those who want a curated experience go through an app store.There is no radical innovation on the formula here, nor any significant improvement justifying a switch.Even if this weren't a scam, it would fail.
This.
OP confirmed retarded.
Bitcoins decentralized network was inspired through the torrent networks.
Dumb fuck.
t. someone who has never used a private tracker or understands the incentivization models behind one
and bitcoin is now a problem that everyones trying to solve.we cant use bitcoin for any sort of torrent payment network
