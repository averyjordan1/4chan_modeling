/biz/ says do opposite that /biz/ says...
The universe collapses in paradoxes.
I listened to biz and jump on EPY and made money, sometimes biz is right
Just bought 100k btc
Just bought 100k btcJust sold 100k btc
Biz told me to buy BCC.
doubled my monies
Why think in biz there are people who knows what they are talking about...If you make a survey in ypur university and ask if they use 4chan, the ones that say yes are only people without social skills, otakus, furries, who studies art.Don't expect much from this community
