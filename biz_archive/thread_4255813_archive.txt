The KING


Lol i fu king sold 15 xmr 3 days ago 10 mins before it started mooning.
I fomoed the BTC rise.
I hope I can mine enough before the price rises astronomically.

Hoping for a dip.
Why the fuck didnt i buy at 75.
I went LTC instead, JUST
What did you go with my man?
I'm interested in setting one up soon.
Thinking multiple Vega 56's with risers on a mining motherboard.Also nervous about XMR skyrocketing before I get it set up.
Press k to kneel for the king
I WILL PREVAIL
About to go for a real run, $200 is my target.

All the technical analysis is saying so, this fork not happening is the catalyst.
god dammit I was gonna buy but too late.

We're still in the dip.
Last peak was about 145, next one will be 200.
Buy and hodl my friend.

THE FUCKING KING
Not him but I got r9 390 for $150 locally and it got 700 to 800 h/s but I sold it when the price jumped from $45 and difficulty doubled...
I should've kept it since it was still profitable
Yeah I'm using an R9 380x and an R9 270x on nicehash.
Only slightly profitable after power expenses but I don't care because I just view it as extra bitcoin that should keep appreciating.
I'm starting to look at mining differently since things have just kept exploding this year.
