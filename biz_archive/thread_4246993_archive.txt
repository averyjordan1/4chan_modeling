I believe that the decentralized economy will hold many figurative parallels to the real economy.
If this is the case I think there will certain coins that will be comparable to base commodities and the rest will be comparable to companies on the stock exchange.
Atm bitcoin seems to be a representative of gold (strictly currency, valuable because of its rarity).
Silver may be litecoin or one of the many other alts that has a bigger supply but acts strickly as a currency.
Ether/neo seem to be like oil/infastructural materials (iron, blah blah).
I feel like RLC may become real estate.
I know this is a bit silly but I think there maybe a little insight to be found in discussing this.
Any others people can spot?
Haha wrong pic
Post the right pic and maybe a discussion can begin.
Haha a bit late now
Litecoin it is..... no need for Neo......
