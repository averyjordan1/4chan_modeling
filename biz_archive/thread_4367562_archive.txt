Do you think it's better to accumulate first and then go all in on crypto, or build every paypacket?
Personally, I buy every week.
dollar cost averaging will serve you better than lump sum.
Go all in with every paycheck you get (after you set aside some $$$ for rent/grocery/utilties of course)
How does dollar cost average outweigh lump sum in fees?
Thanks all, I was worried building slowly would fuck me over with the fees but i'll give it a go!
