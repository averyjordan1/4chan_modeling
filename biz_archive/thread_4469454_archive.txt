Deciding on my alt portfolio of 5 coins.
So far gotLINKSubstratumDRPChainTrade (look it up holy shit this could be big)Would love some suggestions for the 5th spot.
I want it to be a long term hold with almost a guaranteed x3+.
I'm thinking Bancor maybe?
Also eyeing GNT/RLC
REQ which will basically replace Paypal.
vtcltcethxmrgrs
ETH because of smart contractsLINK because of orcalesChainTrade because holy shit you like it already so why not?XMR if you're into enabling drug dealers and long term holdsand the fifth IDK, maybe BAT (advertising industry online, half a trillion industry, 99% controlled by google)but mostly, DYOR
OP, I didn't ask to become a footfag.
Yep looking for research suggestions basically.
I don't trust BAT, not only for the ICO bullshit but because it's core concept is selling advertisement on an unpopular browser that's whole point is to block advertisements.
I really see BAT going nowhere but down in the long term.
Hmmm maybe SALT is a good grab.
Looks like it's aimed at being x5
ok, I will help you out with the thinking but in the end is your decisionthe thing with bat is that users get the incentive to unblock adds (instead of blocking them like they usually do) because they get revenue if they have adds unblocked.Publishers see this as a new amrket with viewers that actually are willing to see their addsad space is bought with BAT, publishers are paid with BAT, and users get paid with BATthis generates demandI agree Brave needs to cach on for this to be big but they plan to add the BAT system into other browsers as an add-on, if it ever catches on ofcso if you believe in online advertising and crypto, BAT is the token for youalso brave is in beta but it works poretty well, fast and no ads, specially on mobile version
Users viewing ads don't receive BAT that can be exchanged into fiat.
It's a dif thing altogether that can only be used to "support" the ads you like.
Nobody is going to do that...
