I told you a few weeks ago around 700 Sats and no one cared.
Im taking my free time again for this post, and this shall be the last time.
Im honestly just trying to be nice and grow the community, its not like posting this gonna make it moon.Im not going to spoon feed you.
Im just here to say if you don't know what bitshares is, you really are going to pink wojak later.Telegramt.me/Bitshares_Traderst.me/BitSharesDEX

Yeah I heard this in 2015 and it barely moved since then.
The community says it's always about to "10x because superior usefulness and technology" but it never happens.
Lol you saved that in a notepad you fucker ?You always reply the same exact shit !Classic Fud, you have an argument you would like to share ?
?
I've said something like this exactly once before on this board.
I was there well before BTS went 2.0 and I was there for a while after.
I read delegate chats too.Once ethereum took off even the hope that superior technology and superior utility would make it take off was lost.The only hope bitshares has is being integrated into EOS and ethereum's scaling solutions failing spectacularly.It's harmful to one's objectivity to be in a community echo chamber like that of bitshares.
People were deluded about how markets really adopt things.Bitshares was ahead of its time, but people didn't care.
Also the DPOS political governance system was awkward at best back then, but I assume it was matured by now.
It's too late, however.
