>Have to lock up tokens to get the premium cards.>Premium cards are dope af>Cards aren't even out yetWhen these cards hit the market, hundreds of thousands (or more) tokens will be locked away.Supply and demand.
Do the math.
Fedora coin, Kibicoin, & Litcoin plus have all had over a 1000% increase nearing 2000%.
I'd invest in these when they fall heavily as they are very volatile.
But as of right now, try for honey as it has had a 70% loss while carbon coin dropped about 74% over the past 24hr.
Those increases should be to your advantage if they skyrocket.
Ark.Your $12k will be $60k by December and twice that by Jan

If you cost average it as a btc holder I think it's a better hedge than even bch or other alts because the network is very reliable and the holders generally seem mature and long-term oriented from the price action in the past.
people think unit supply doesn't matter but it does in the sense that a smaller supply gives the price action better "resolution" in that the market cap varies less with the price action than large supply coins.
that aspect combined with network strength, place on polo, and the other factors I mentioned are all reasons I think it's a good hedge against btc and worth running wherever you have 556 mb free
