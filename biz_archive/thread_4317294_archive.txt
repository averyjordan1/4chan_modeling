Use higher fees to get your transactions through on the BTC chain and then preferably dump it to either ETH, XMR or BCH.The BTC chain will degrade even further over time until transactions wont be possible.

this man speaks the truth anon, if you want to move btc at all do it now, it is going to get much worse
So much money will be lost in this mess once BTC stops functioning.
bch already has 71% of the hash power
Yes, BCH is in the clear lead.
Let's see how the difficulty adjustment tomorrow will affect the hash power.This might turn out very bloody for BTC.
they have the new difficulty adjustment tomorrow though.
It's over
Wut?
I just said they have the difficulty adjustment tomorrow and you replied:>they have the new difficulty adjustment tomorrow thoughI don't get your post.
Oh, I see, you said the NEW difficulty adjustment.Yes.
This is the interesting part.
Hard to say what will happen exactly.
there's a hardfork tomorrow to improve the eda which will probably result in a smaller difficulty increase
