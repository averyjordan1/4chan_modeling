/sci/ questionwhy is it that alcohol we drink but most other drugs we eat or smoke.
??

Nice just bought 100k
why is it you're asking /biz/?
It simply has to do with the melting point of the drugMost drugs are solid at room temp, alcohol is liquid.
Just how it is based on its molecular structureshould also note that you CAN drink weed, its called a cannabis tincture
Medical marijuana is often liquid...
although this is /biz/ I think I can answer some of this.. convenience.I can eat mushrooms plain, or on peanut butter and jelly or make it into a tea.. if I make a tea I might not get all of what makes you trip, im too lazy to do this but it is possible.acid is a liquid I could drink but I only need a few drops.and here in colorado you better believe we can make weed into an edible.The highs are a little different when you eat weed.. it comes on a little slower, when I smoke it just straight to the dome in like a minute.. oxygen circulates your body faster, when you eat or drink something it takes about 15-45 minutes to metabolize.I hope this helps
How can I fuck her
what makes you think people only smoke weed?People make shit with weed/hash and milk/chocolate or Cake
Yeah not quite though Biz, We smoke weed because of THC-A and Decarboxylation which converts the precursor to a psychoactive form.
We would have to decarboxylate a tincture or bake a food containing weed to experience the psychoactive properties.

Habit.
There is no science behind it.
Also quicker you get the buzz, better for people.
Drinking alcohol is one of the quickest way to get its buzz.
You're doing it all wrong.
You should just inject the marijuanas straight into your eyeballs bro.
