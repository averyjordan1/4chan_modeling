$200K to $2 million portfolio via crypto.
Is this possible within 6 months-1 year?
Any whale groups on here?
Lmao HMU when you have 200 mil.
Get the fuck out with that baby money
you can pull that off with a day at the roulette table
everything is possible if you are smart about it ( and somewhat lucky too )
I think you mean 2 mill down to 200k.
If that's the case,then yes, very possible.
If you're just getting started I wouldn't recommend putting 200k unless you can afford to eventually lose them

Possible?
Certainly, just as gambling at the casino.
Unless you already have a LOT of experience trading crypto/crypto space in general or get incredibly lucky it won't be realistic.It's quite easy to double 0.1 btc, try that with 30btc plus
This.
I mean black or red, it's like 50/50 basically, do you wanna be gay 200k, chad 0k or alphamale god 400k?
