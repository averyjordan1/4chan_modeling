Which one of you just payed 234 eth for .003 CFD?
Someone trying to pump it
is that for real?
did they really fat finger away 234 eth???
brainlet cant even read the trade list correctlyThey paid 0.7 eth for 0.003 at the PRICE of 234
Probably got the token amount and buy price flipped around lmao
its not 234 retard
just a classic ED fatfingering but it was for .7 eth, not 234
