Who's still bullish?I'm not, it's a lottery ticket now.
dumb FUDstill bullish as fuck
Why hasn't the price increased
are you new.
alts are down because BTC is moonin'
BTC is always mooning, are you just going to repeat this until LINK is at one sat?could've had a x100 portfolio if you just simply held BTC instead of LINK>"just hodl, ORACLES are the FUTURE"
I'm still bullish but I doubt my own ability to predict these things more and moreI read the whitepaper.
It all sounds so good.
But what do I know?
I'll hold and keep reminding myself that it's early days
BTC is always mooningnewfag detected
