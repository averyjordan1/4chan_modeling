https://cointelegraph.com/news/segwit2x-hard-fork-could-have-devastating-consequences-for-bitcoinWhy is everyone still so bullish on BTC?
it's another "if that happens, than that will probably happen, but we can't know for sure now"-scenario
which directly falls into the generic FUD category
FUD is rational in this case.
The downside potential is huge.
nobody is bullish.
everybody plans to exit bitcoin prior the fork.
Idiots are bullish.
Smart money is going into bch pre-fork
Miners decided to move to S2X so that’s what is happen.
Why even think that it could be otherwise when you’re not part of the Blockstream cult?
so what, just send 5% of your btc holdings to bitmex and short it with a x25 leverage; that way you'll make more money off a crash than you lose with the rest of your money.
If it keeps going up, well then you lost 5% of your btc holdings for healthier nights.
