I'm not sure desu.I larp as trasher for fun, I think I'm not the only one.
just sell kevin it isn't worth it bro
Larping as a Bitcoin Cashie makes me laugh when it goes down and I still tell everyone to keep buying for the flippening.
Went to sleep yesterday% btc 20% shitcoins>Dreamt I woke up and checked coinmarketcap>See BCH at 6k and BTC at 2k>Wake up in terror>Realize it's just a dream>mfwWew.
I'm going to buy BTC when it hits rock bottom.
I trust that just as the Jews won't let BTC fail even though it's shit, the chinks won't let BCH fail.Both are going to rise.
