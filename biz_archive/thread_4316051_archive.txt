The only stop loss is the grave >Bought the dip at .505 BTC
Fucking retardYou deserve it kek

HERE IT COMES
they are eating up the sell book with way too high volume, then playing a 1k buy wall just below their highest eaten price.does this work?
do they even care atm or are they panicking and returning to very brute obvious methods?I guess with enough BTC you can make any coin go up again.
Dead cat
bought bcc at .35, RIP, lost a lot
Hold it, there will be second top when europeans get up.
Had so little bcc at the end of last week that I couldn't even sell itJust traded that scrap for a litecoin lol
what exchange did you buy in?, it only hit like 0,42 on bittrex.and yes, i bought in at that price.
This is what happens when you fuck with THE KING.
biggest PUMP AND DUMP in history?
The year is 2023.I want to order a coffee with Bitcoin Cash.
That will be 128 Cashtoshi's, sir.
Everybody laughs as I reach for my digital wallet to pay, the waiter looks at his watch and his face turns red: There is no need to pay for coffee in a place you own, boss.
I smile, salute him, and as I walk to the exit, another waiter stops me: WE NOW DONT ACCEPT THAT WORTHLESS CHINK MONEY HERE NO SIR!
You pay us with real money, or Bitcoin!
OP hereBitfinex...Cashed out 60% of my portfolio to buy "muh satoshis vision".
What a fucking scam
How many dumped their alts for .4 BCH ????
A cat driven to the point of extinction while make weird bounces.
This may pop back up over 0.3.My advice though.
Just take your losses and forget about this coin.
shills getting desperate.
