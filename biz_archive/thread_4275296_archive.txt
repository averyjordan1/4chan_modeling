So whats the consensus on this shit, is it going to keep pumping or what?Obviously the chinks and yuropoors don't care about it because it doesn't pump during their peak times, so America is our only hope.So the question is, will we be buying or dumping tomorrow morning?
it had an insane run up and its cooling off, shit in crypto moves faster now, but think of this as the 2013-2014 bubble moment for bitcoin, on a really fast time scale
