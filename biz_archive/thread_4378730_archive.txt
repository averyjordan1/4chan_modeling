This will take time young one
It will eventually, I’m thinking $100 sometime Q1 next year.
It’s 15% of my povertyfolio, I think it’s a strong coin and 2018 will be a big year for it (I hope)
when will china regulate their shit ?
China, if you all don't know.
Takes it time everything !
Chinese Ethereum>Majority of investors are white beta amerifats>Not even popular among its intended audiencesye boi

what's better, NEO or XRP
Chinks>Kikes.

when bch 2nd and 3rd pump will be over, then we switch to neo
"it will take time">meanwhile bitcoin goes to fucking $100k in a matter of weeks at this ratetime is a luxury we don't have in crypto.
you will lose money if you keep holding shitbags like this for longer than a couple of weeks.
You better buy ETP
