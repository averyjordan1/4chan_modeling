Hi, /biz/I'm from Chile, there is presidential elections going on here.
So, I just finished my master degree and I'm fucking scared.
There is a not-low-enough chance of a socialist president being elected.
What should I do in that case?
I own nothing, I can't just leave the country now.
Should I start to sell shit?
Work in any retarded shit and accumulate crypto?
I need advice.
I think /pol/ can probably help you get your mind on the right track.
I don't care about race and all the retarded shit going on there.
I care about work, money, food and housing.
If the socialisimo revolucion comes about then just kick back and get the free gibs.
That was my plan if Bernie had somehow managed to get elected here.
Focus on your career and thats it.
No need of pol for now.
Don't waste ur time
