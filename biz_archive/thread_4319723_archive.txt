Is BTG worth investing in once in comes out?Also, i've read that the whole pint of BTG is to make mining easier and more accessible to everyone.
Would it be worth it to get in the game early?
Realistically you're still going to have a hard time mining because everyone will be using their ethereum mining rigs to mine btg.
