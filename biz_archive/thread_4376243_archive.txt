>tfw 50-50 on BTC and LINK (that was bought at ICO)Is there a comfier hold?
why haven't you sold your Link and bought it back at a lower price?
It's in MEW, too much of a hassle to sell it.
Never sold a single LINK and don't plan to till it hits 3 dollars.Pajeet day traders and bots are the reason why the coin hasn't mooned yet
I think btc pump is over for today time to buy back in
he didnt sell at ATHyou didnt sell at ATHyoudidntsellatATHHAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHA deluded LINKIE you are getting ass raped enjoy your bags and remember: bank supercomputers in every city
he thinks he can time the market>he thinks that was even close to possible ATHkek
you cant time the marketBut you can take your profits.
What was it, 5x from the ICO?
You wont ever see that ATH price again.
You fucked up, deluded forever.Enjoy shilling for months
Maybe OP isn't playing with chickenfeed, unlike you?
You can't just sell a ton of volume at ATH, poorfag.Gj OP
supercomputers cmon guys he is just joking with you
Finally someone gets it.
If I tried to "day trade" LINK, it would crash the fucking price
link has never come close to ICO price since hitting ED.
The final ICO price was like 0.00036 ETH.
The fact its never been in a loss is more reason to actually long term hold.
Brainlet here, would I make more money cashing my bitcoin profits @ $7,300 and reinvesting when it dips again or by hodling and being greedy?
if you believe or have some other reasoning that makes you sure it will dip, it would be smart to sell and then rebuy when its down.
If you think it will just rise, it would be smart to put more money into it
That's why I dont daytrade, you can never tell what's gonna happen, everytime I think it will dip it increases.In my opinion, considering that there have been news that some big players are gonna come in december, you should buy regardless of the price, because it will have risen enough next year that you won't really care.
