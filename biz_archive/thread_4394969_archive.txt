Everyone else gets a tax increase:>collapses the tax brackets to four from seven, switches the United States to an international tax system that is more in line with the rest of the world yet, our existing taxes aren't doing shit for infrastructure or providing healthcare to US citizens>scales back many popular deductions, including one for state and local taxes paid.oops, to bad for anyone who has to pay state/local taxes.
