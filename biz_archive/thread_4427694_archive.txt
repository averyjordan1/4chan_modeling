Once people realize that TokenCard is a Whitelabel Cryptodebitcard for ALL ERC20 Projects we will see a 1 Billion Marketcap (no phun intended).
Every ETH Project will have their own TKN based Debitcard!https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tokencard/
Don't you think that TenX already has an advantage over other card projects?

OP, can you explain the point of TKN?
I haven't looked into it much, but I don't see how TKN is going to appreciate in value, its going to give a flat fee reduction or some shit when using TokenCard
Just like MCO (Monaco stole the TokenCard Whitepaper) TokenCard has a Asset Contract.
Everytime you purchase something 1% of the purchase price goes into it.
TKN Holders can burn TKN to redeem them.The Idea is that TKN has a Kind of Crypto Gold Standard so the Value never can drop to 0.
When you use TKN you pay 0% Fees at the Cashier.Check out the Whitepaper:https://tokencard.io/tokencard_whitepaper.pdf1.
I can keep my Wallet (MyEtherWallet) / Private Key2.
Its a Whitelabel Card.
There will be Cards from $SNGLS $BNT $DGD based on TokenCard with their own Logo.3.
Marketcap Compare TenX and MCO
TenX is the First of Course, but they are NOT a Whitelabel Cryptodebitcard.
