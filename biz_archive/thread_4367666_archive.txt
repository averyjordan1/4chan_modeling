I'm scared..
I feel like we're in for another round of TOTAL JUSTING soonShould I exit all crypto markets?
quiet usually means moon incoming
Market's too quietIt quietly just reached a total market cap of 210 billion.
they are waiting on the BCH moon mission
It's a moon mission this time
BTC will decline within 24 hours and BCH will rise
core of the earth mission confirmed
I think people who are in profit are parked in fiat right now.
Only bag holders are currently chasing gains right now.
I might miss a 10% gain on btc or eth but fuck that way too much uncertainty.
I am pretty convinced this whole pack of cards is about to come falling down
