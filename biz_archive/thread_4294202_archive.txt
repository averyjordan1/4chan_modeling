I dropped $100 on eth when it was 80 cents.
Whatever that gain is.
started with 1000 bucks in june, sitting at 68000 now feels okay
+~850%got into btc sub 800$
+25% or so since July.
Pretty much all of that is from bitcoin though.
All my alts turned out a wash except for +50% ETH spike during the BCH fork (and bitcoin went up just as much if not more during that episode)Joined PBC and gonna go all-in during November pump though, so in a week it's gonna be +200% or -100%.
I'll be amped up on amphetamines Thursday morning hitting F5 on the subscriptions page like nobody's business.

My trading account on Bittrex in September went from 10 BTC to 28 to now 7.
I've learnt a hard lesson to never trust alts like I did in the past two years.
I still have a good amount of coins offline so I'm not too depressed about what happened
HNNNNNNGGGGHH IS THAT REALLY HER??
HNNNNNGGGHHH JEW UDDERS
+50%It was originally +100% but I got out two months ago after I started taking losses.
+ 500%You guys realise that btc went over 600 % this year right.This uptrend will probably continue.If you are unprofitable trading alts you should simply hold btc.90% of traders lose money.Also Link is a mindvirus and you should stop deluding yourself.
+~2500%Entered with 100 dollars of ETH in March-ish when it was 15 dollars.
Sold at 45 dollars and thought I was a genius.
Reinvested with ~1000 dollars.I have been much more patient and learned a lot since then.
Luck + research + being pretty selective in ICOs.
Hit a few of the great ones, whiffed on a couple.
Happy with my portfolio right now for the longish term.
No daytrading ever.
% traders lose money?
Where did you get this from?
About 100000%No joke.
i want to oven those
+112% rode the bitcoin wave all the way and then went all in on bch a few days ago
