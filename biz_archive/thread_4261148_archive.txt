Looking to invest 3k-7k in actual stock.
I have money in crypto already, so looking at traditional stocks only.
Mainly want to dump all of it into Amazon?
Thoughts?
Whatâ€™s the best site to purchase from?
Australian lithium stocks.
Thank me later, anon.
Here you go op.
Good luck on your thread.
NVIDIA, already one of if not the best performing stock of 2016, and if you think crypto will continue to do well then so will NVIDIA, but wait until after today's earnings announcement.
Amazon's pretty high right now they just had a good run.
Check out /rgt/ at open tomorrow there's always one here you will get more answers there.
Are you looking for more volatility or boomer blue chips?
TD Ameritrade.
Put it in some blue chips (JNJ, for example) or a Vanguard mutual fund.
Your crypto risk factor is high enough for a portfolio.
Amazon is a good stock but it's going to eat shit when big investors take profits whenever interest rates go up.
Don't buy a stock at ATH.
Buy marijuana stocks if anything you will make a killing.
Investing in "stock" instead of an ethereum token that is a smart contract that pays dividends by implication of how the utility it enables functions and is being paid for by users of the smart contractSorry just, uh, buy micron.
Amazon is priced in.Micron already has a great p/e ratio at above 9% which is projected to increase due to increased demand for memory over the next years.
On top of this they might explode if they their 3DXPOINT technology becomes the first mover in high density cheap nonvolatile memory.
It would be massive and the preferred memory for all datacenters that deal with large dataset computations.The golden jackpot is if they get their memory processor automata to work.
But that's further down the line.
However, that could be a 10 or even 20x gain over a 7 year period.
It would be the most golden goose in decades of computing intellectual property.
