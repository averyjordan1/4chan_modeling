YEAH I GOT IN AT 110K!!
!1FINALLY MAKING MONEY OFF THIS THING!
F-Flip it.Jihan says flip it guys!
The flippening is NOT a meme, it's a reality and corecucks will REGRET not selling their dinosaur for a better coin

jts dead guys im sorry.
greedy little monkey boys are not going to help you.
bch is just a shit attempt like btc unlimited or other filth attempts.
its dead.
just stop.
its over for bch
FLIP YOUR MOTHER IF YOU WANT FLIP
I dont get it, why doesnt Roger Ver and this guy just dump btc and pump this shit for us
Just wait that BTC give up to his desperate try to break $8000, it won't happen and enjoy a big green candle on this shitcoin.I guess it's already almost happening.
getting the right timing and getting more juice for the flip, right after the last one wouldn't work very well but riding this btc wave after the other bch pump 2x's the POWER, just hold on and believe
for usimplying they give a single fuck about retards on /biz/ that are bag holding.
I've held free BCH since the fork and hate the arrogance of the segcore cucks, but Roger does exude a heavy larping vibe.
he did do that with a portion of his btc.
it didnt work.
if he did it with his entire holdings he would go bankrupt.
the market decided it doesn't want jihan coin.
I don't want to believe in this shitcoin but something is definitely going on and it scares me
The market didn't decide to take bithumb down that night.
A group of people did.
Yeah, whichever side you're on, you have to be deluded to think that this was just a pump and dump lol.
BOP IT
