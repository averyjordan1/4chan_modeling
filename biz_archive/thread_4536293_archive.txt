Sorry, not really understanding what I am reading here.
Browsing the Iota tangle, specifically the top 100 addresses, started running into this tag.https://thetangle.org/tag/9999STOLEN9IOTAS999FUCK9YOULike, was there a huge hack?
Some of these 19 000 pending transactions are in the millions of US dollars.https://thetangle.org/transaction/MP9E9OATFBUFAVCVZPYVAMA99NTYMKBOAVXZMUKKABCBHVUTSTJNYGYHIXKUGVTNISJXAVQXCYPL99999https://thetangle.org/transaction/GUZDISJJXRXZTCNMAMPK9BCQFHXKVGAJHMSASTQGRGVVDSVEWPJUSIKBNCUCITYCMSAHFZTJBCOAA9999
Nobody?
Many seem to be routed to this address, in 145.8 GIota bundles (about 100k USD).
Those aren't repeated transactions, they're all from different addresses.https://thetangle.org/address/XWHSRRMKZKLHQZJCRBGOVESSUNBUX9H9HUHLFQLCMLMRRHLHMVGUJZ9QX9SOHTZMNRNGGLFWNWUYHCAWDLike about 50 x 145.8 GIota?
So, over five million being transferred to this address?
damn
https://www.google.com/search?q=9999STOLEN9IOTAS999FUCK9YOU&filter=0&biw=1600&bih=730fucking tons of it.
i see this tag all the time, and i have no fucking clue why other people havent asked this question
Actually, there are 12 000 more transactions not displayed, so it's probably a lot more than that.
Some of these pending transactions are less than a day old...https://thetangle.org/transaction/KFSHOGUPWUNSLROREKDXFRDIRPTOWUETAF9XBWPBMMITIVTGQQMIJJVW9JOODBDFDWBYBDTLPRKB99999
DUMP IOTAI haven't seen the team respond to this yet even though this like a huge breach.
Well, they announced today that they are hiring a cryptographic security company.https://blog.iota.org/iota-foundation-hires-cybercrypt-615d2df79001Bitfinex meanwhile, announced that Iota withdrawals should be good to go... Maybe the entire tangle was frozen, locked into pending transaction status?Am I crazy?
This seems like it would be huge.
All day (before this flash crash) Binance had an alert on IOTA saying "network congestion / withdrawal times may be delayed"...this was the ONLY coin with this alert...
HOURS AND HOURS AGOFrom the other thread.
Honestly everyone needs to dump IOTA now before they get rekt hard.
But nobody can.
Everybody has to create a new address with a new seed, then reclaim their...Holy fuck, they were definitely fucking hacked.
And they're covering it up.
It's pretty obvious whoever is making these transactions has malicious intent.
I'd be very careful
post this shit on reddit.
that dev fag is always on the iota subreddit defending his bs crypto
It's pretty obvious whoever is making these transactions has malicious intent.
I'd be very carefulmalicious intent to spread coordinated fud and scoop up cheap iota from weak hands probably
when i transferred 1 giota to okex, i was redirected to the GUZDISJJXRXZTCNMAMPK9BCQFHXKVGAJHMSASTQGRGVVDSVEWPJUSIKBNCUCITYCMSAHFZTJBCOAA9999 transaction when checking the status even though that is not my transaction ID.
it is fixed now though??
real people who have had iota stolen under this tag:https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7e0gu8/186gi_stolen_from_android_wallet/https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7da10b/iota_light_wallet_hacked/
I'm sorry
it changed back to a legitimate transaction, what do you think that means?
I am not sure why you are sorry but its okay
real people who have had iota stolen under this tag:>https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7e0gu8/186gi_stolen_from_android_wallet/>https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7da10b/iota_light_wallet_hacked/one dude confirmed he reused adressanother one used some shady online seed generatorit's like blaming etherdelta for fatfingering your order
two completely different scenarios.bad seed generatoraddress reusesame stolen tag.also no one can explain to me why using the same receiving address multiple times can put your seed at risk.
clarify pls
ITS AN EXIT SCAMSELL SELL SELL SELL
Isnt IOTA the same crypto that had a huge vulnerability discovered by an MIT professor?
Iâ€™ll be staying clear of that garbage have fun getting your money tangled into nothing
fuck it, went straight to the source.theyre shit transactions

same stolen tag.well duhit's not like the whole world is targeting iotaprobably one hacker or a group>also no one can explain to me why using the same receiving address multiple times can put your seed at risk.
clarify plsevery outgoing transaction it sends part of the private key with one time signature which degrades every time it reused making it vulnurable to reverse bruteforce
vulnurable to reverse bruteforcethat doesn't compromise your whole wallet thoughonly this one address
Well.
That's kind of reassuring.
Except that the sheer spam transaction overload may be grinding the network to a crawl.
A currency that can have your funds stolen if you use it twice.
Lol this shit is going to be mainstream adopted tomorrow!
Stay poor
its supposed to be machine-adopted so it wouldn't be difficult to automate address re-generation after transactionthey are working on this, right now I think there aren't many nodes
