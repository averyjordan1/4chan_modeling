i think it might be the next etherdelta shit coin.
already listed on binance too... usually i like exclusive to etherdelta for my shit coins.
this one might be the next to pump a lil.
been starting to see a lil hype here and there.what you guys think?
filled my bags...greatly undervalued gem and the company alrdy have clients using their platform
not really a shitcoin when you got advisors from the bitcoin foundation, changelly, lykke and many more.
with a circulating supply of 4 mill it'll probably be at $7 by next week
super low trading volume.
expect that to pick up but holding bags atm
