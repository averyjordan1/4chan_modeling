just bought my first Cryptocurrency.Â£100 LTCHave I fucked up?
yes sell nowmarket will crash soon
yeah sell now
Comfy hold.
You wont see massive gains but you wont see massive loses.
sell now, fuck
that moment when I, as a newfag, have no idea if those "sell now" comments were honest or not.
*hangs himself*
Jesus, do some research first.
Why LTC?
Who hurt you when you were a child that you think this is a good idea?
They are joking.That coin is pretty stable, don't expect massive gains or losses overnight.Take a look at NEO on coinmarketcap and see if you're interested.
