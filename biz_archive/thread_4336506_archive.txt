Alright guys, it's been fun LARPing as a crypto trader the last two days, even though I'm a nocoiner.
Pretending to be a genius and give random tips, pretending to be pink wojack, etc.I just have one question: I know you guys are exaggerating your emotions to make this board more amusing, but how much of it is real?
Seems like a lot of badly thought-through trades are going on...
First, what's the name of that roasted?
Absolutely nothing of this is real, have you even tried to google coinbase?
It doesn't exist, you played yourself kid.
You don't sound white.
I can tell.

black tape projectWomen have the dumbest fucking projects.
Its all scammers and crooks dude, dont buy, just trade and sell high.
Cash in every day, let the fools keep the crypto, its manipulated to death, worse than the Feds.
You'd be surprised at how much of this fuckshit is real
hahahaha yup.
If you want fucking bubble wrapped rules and spoon feeding customers and wiping asses like babies...fuck that shit
I'm down $200, it's not a huge deal but I still feel pretty fucking JUST right now.
i find it easiest to argue about crypto in terms of faggots cucks retards and marines, this is where i write down the logic for my decisions in the form of abusing the absolute fuck out of other anons which keeps me motivated day in day out, and they get my analysis for free.
nobody is really interested in working anything out here anymore though, its ravaged by weak as shit shills, reddit would send me straight back so i just hang around exposing pajeets hoping they leave so we can make it together.
i really miss the nocoiners, they were fun.
So basically, thinking out loud with lots of swearing, pics of half-naked girls, and wojaks.
I like it.
