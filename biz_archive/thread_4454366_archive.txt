What deposit amount can trigger an SAR (suspicious activity report) by the bank?I know depositing $10K cash does.
It doesn't necessarily mean IRS will actually pay attention to it.
They're just supposed to report it.Some of you guys have deposited shitload into your bank from coinbase before right?Apparently no one is really paying taxes on cryptohttp://fortune.com/2017/03/19/irs-bitcoin-lawsuit/So, do banks have to create SARs based on deposits?
If someone deposits 50K from coinbase, is that flagged to IRS?
yeah but if you're cashing out less to hide it you can get in trouble too
