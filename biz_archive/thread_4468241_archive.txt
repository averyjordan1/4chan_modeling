How can EVERYONE get 10x gains from here?
Also, I always use my friends as a bellwether for hype.
Now that they are all "investing" (speculating) in bitcoin, I expect it to all fall down soon.
Gentleman, we have reached peak hype.
what are you talking about, the numbers are big, but it was a 5% from $7700
its growing exponentially, every normie that invests gets big gains and tells their network of normies.
I give it a while before they get into altcoins, they gotta get comfortable
