IOTA devs and cp loving vitalik went at it on twitter and come from behind revealed he is bcnext who invented pos, the functionality eth will use in the future.
Biz still think IOTA is shit?

Yes.
What are the implications of this, who is BCNext?Where is this guy on a scale of Satoshi level, Vitalik level and Pajeet level?
Biz still think IOTA is shit?It's shit for taking custody of my balance and not yet returning it.
I ran that reclaim tool 2 weeks ago.
Nothing has been returned.
At this point, he may be SatoshiHere is his profile from bitcointalkhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=152600
in a few years, hell, maybe next year people will realize IOTA makes ETH obsolete
He invented proof-of-stake.
Four years ago.
So above Vitalik, beneath Satoshi.
Bingo.
Read the twitter exchange, he silenced Vitalik.
He is the real deal.
I think he was tired of FUD from other devs and felt it was time to ensure he was legit.
This is pretty fucking big!
Just shows the dev-calibre behind iota!
I'm 5 please explain what is BCNext and what is his relation to IOTA?
BCNext was an anonymous figure that invented proof of stake.
He was revealed to be CFB, who is the inventor of the DAG/Tangle, the alternative system to blockchain that Iota uses.
He is a core developer of Iota.
Iota is his baby.

4467809Thanks bizbros.
Now I'm in full confidence of holding bags of MIOTA
All gonna make it.
Left known security bug in their own code.>Called amateur devs by MIT>Ignore scalability issues asked in AMANo thanks.
Creator is on par with Satoshi.
>Just BTFO VitalikHm well maybe ill go with this random guys opinion ...
LOLIOTA may be a long hodl but this coin will be top 3 marketcap
4467980next year will be huge for IOTA
G>He invented proof-of-stake.
Four years ago.PEERCOIN WAS THE FIRST PROOF OF STAKE COIN.
That was a hybrid that was flawedNxt perfected 100% PoS
It's not really an opinion when they literally ignore top rated questions addressing scalability.
bro, Vitalik doesn't even understand their concept.
why would they waste time to others who don't get it either?
they have work to do
There is a bunch of stuff to be worked on as the coin is in alpha stage but knowing IOTA dev team is proven is a plus.
Also, there have been some possible solutions to the scalability questions.
I don't think IOTA has announced what route they will take.
I rose 60% in the past 4 days.Only thing I regret is not buying more and having no more money for it (not gonna take it out of my other coins because I believe in all of them)
IOTA founder regularly puts Vitalik in his place: https://twitter.com/DavidSonstebo/status/932510087301779456
That cradle-robber is threatened by Iota
>Bought IOTA on a whim last mondaytfw
HOLY SHIT JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER GIOTA HAHAHAHAHHAAHHA LOVE THIS GUY
fuck that pedo
but rat4 of blackcoin invented pos
but rat4 of blackcoin invented posclearly not 
CfB was the first to do "full PoS"I'm not sure what the difference is from PoS, though.
Pedo commies allied with goat fucking suicide bomber supporters.
Fuck em all.
Reminder that iota hates their investors
wat
Are you talking about the fact they're holding onto the funds of thousands of users, and haven't given an ETA of when they'll return the money?If so, it's a legit gripe.
It's upsetting because they have been censoring discussion about it on their subreddit, and have been rather quiet about it.
I just want my money back.Other than that, they are a great project.

There is no way there is this much enthusiasm for these two shitcoins.
This growth for BTC has never been seen since late 2013, you know, right before Mt.
Gox crashed and burned when they too also faked their numbers in hopes that the pump would continue long enough to pay off their lost BTC.
such as offline transactionsAre they actually fucking claiming that?
What the fuck.Zero feels is still theoretically possible if you don't count your own energy usage in validating other people's transactions
Cool story brainlet
this amount of buttmad
The inspiration behind the iota logo.
Zero fees work now you mongoloid.
