is there any way to see what website you sent your bitcoins to?
I have the transaction details but don't know what site I sent them to a few years agoFML
Check the address in a block explorer, there should be the name of the website associated with it somewhere.
I know when I send shit to a binance wallet, for example, I can look up the destination address in the block explorer and it says "binance" on the page somewhere
Doesn't say that for me.here is an example1EPDxJYiMQV6ymMFTmV8gBL2bsfMcrTaxg
You could try Googling the addresses if you havenâ€™t already
No luck.
I'm honestly feeling like it's a loss.
