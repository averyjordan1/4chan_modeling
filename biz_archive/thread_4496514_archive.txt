I see discord servers advertised on hear all the time.
The question is are they all scams?It seems like a majority of the servers advertised are PnD groups.
Are all of them like this?How many of you are in one?
remember the leader and his friends will always be ahead of everyone else.
so make your own and hope that it gets popular.
I just joined one I found here.
I haven't really followed it.
It looks like the pump works for two seconds before everyone sells.
There's zero trust and its probably just designed to benefit the admins.
