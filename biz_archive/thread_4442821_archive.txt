So i read about link and i see unbelievable potential, this is the best thing to happen in crypto this will open the door to mass adoption im ready do dump 20k in this but i dont know where is safe to hold it and whats with æternity and Mobius they have decentralized oracle as well?
it's a scam desu.
just buy monero instead> inb4 pajeet gets mad and calls me a pajeet
Yeah I was worried about aeternity but LINK is lightyears ahead of them.
Sergey registered smartcontract.com before Bitcoin was even invented.
They pretty much have a working product ready to roll out.
They have SWIFT, etc.
in their corner.
They are the oracle guys
Möbius isn't doing anything remotely similar to ChainLink.If you're buying 20k worth put it on a Ledger
