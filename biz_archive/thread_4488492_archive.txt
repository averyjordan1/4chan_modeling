Has anyone ever had their money stolen off of coinbase?
I know bittrex it's happened and on some shitty exchanges.
I want to hold my BTC on coinbase but without 2FA auth I'm kinda nervous.
Does anyone know of coins getting stolen from there?
No 2fa?
Lube up and get JUSTed
All the time but coinbase does all the stealing of the money
Just turn on 2FA dude...
Not using 2FA is just asking for it
They have a cold vault optionsHacker would have to log in, get through 2fa, and validate from 2 separate email accounts set up by usersJust assume your shit is insecure.Don't fall for the meme of storing your own keys and transferring btc everywhere.
Your own behavior and pc is the weakest link
4488515I've looked fucking everywhere for 2FA on their app but I don't see it.
Is it only on the website?
I have 2FA for all my other exchange accounts
Dude.Settings => Enable Two Factor Authentication
Website.
I got phished yesterday.
Someone from a different country tried accessing my account.
I was able to luckily lock my account, but now I probably wont be able to regain access for 1-2weeks with their slow support.
Explain more.
Phished how?
And how were you able to lock your account?
phished through a fake email.
be cautious.
I was able to call them and we agreed to lock the account.
Did they claim to be coinbase?
yes, email claimed I sent $1000 worth of ethereum, and linked me to a fake phishing site.
Looked as legitimate as the coinbase emails.
I would call you an idiot but I got my iPhone stolen and fell for an elaborate phishing scam so it can happen to anyone.
without 2fafrauen mit salat.jpg
it can happen to any idiot
