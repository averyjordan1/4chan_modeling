Ok, so how many of you are really just retarded moon chasers and switch from pump with volume to another pump whenever they think "MOON"?
How many buy ATH, get justed and chase the next pump?And how many are really holding, buying before the actual pump in anticipation to sell IN the pump?
I just made my first trade and made $100 overnight.
