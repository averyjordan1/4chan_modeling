I can recommend it.
pajeet coin
someone needs to tell me if this will make me rich.
I'm not playing around anymore
Definitely a pajeet coin.
But I don't give a fuck if it makes me money.
When was the last time you read a whitepaper?
No, new coins wont experience the alt pump.
This coin has a cap of $3MM.
if the rumor is true this could hit $25MM.
Not to be one of those "OMG FAGGOTS 5x!!!!!!!!!!"
faggots
You guys make your own decisions.
However, this coin for me is a good buy.
This site has helped me in the past.
I guess we will see in a few days when it is released on bittrex.
HUSH dumpers right now
People said that about LTC, ETH, XMR and a dozen other coins, and they just keep being wrong.
going to the mother fucking moon
