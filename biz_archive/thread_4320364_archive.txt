Seriously... think about how corrupt you've become due to money.
Think about how corrupt this world has become due to money.
Money/Currency/Crypto is clearly not the solution to any problems of this world.
Only a money-free society can give us what we all truly desire... FREEDOM & EQUALITY.Many people baulk at the notion of removing money, trade and ownership, and for lots of different reasons.
1.
Money is not essential to life.
Resources are what we need to live, not money.
Money is just a tool, invented to help organise the distribution of scarce resources.
Modern technology now offers us a potential abundance of these resources such as food, water, shelter, and a high standard of living.
We can procure, produce and manufacture all of life's necessities more easily now than ever before.
The only thing scarce nowadays is money itself!
In a money-free world, the concept of rich and poor will be meaningless as everyone will have equal access to all life has to offer.2.
Human nature has just one function: to survive.
This survival instinct drives all our behaviours.
So when we are faced with scarcity, we automatically become greedy, because it's good for survival.
Today, money is scarce and we need it to live, so we try and get as much as we can.
It's a perfectly natural response to a world where people who don't have money die.Once people realise there is no longer any real scarcity, and they are a vital part of a community that supports them, greed and selfishness will become unnecessary.
Our instincts will then drive positive behaviours such as cooperation, trust and compassion which are also necessary for survival.This is the future: http://www.freeworldcharter.org/enFAQ: http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en/faqs
