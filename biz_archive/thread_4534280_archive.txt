Hey /biz.
Some of you may have seen me post about this before.
I've made quite a bit of money here and every once in a while I like to pass on some good info.
This is set to moon within the next couple of hours, probably to about .68 - .71 Full disclosure, I bought this at .22 so I'm sitting comfy.
I just like to give back to a board that has giving me so much.
Passing on good Karma.
If you bough high, don't panic, it's headed up.
Take care guys
I lost $300 on this shit.
Fuck off.
You didn't lose anything until you sell.
I hope you didn't.
If you did, learn from this, remember those 300 dollars and learn to never sell at a loss unless you're in on a shitcoin.
FOMO`ed at 7300?
kek
I'm serious anon, learn from this and don't give up
