Fuck off, MY waifu
Nah, the UK finding and Jaguar partnership have checked out.
Both released press releases.
Unless ofcourse the UK gov and Jaguar Landrover is getting scammed.. kinda doubt that.

Well I bought more after many people dropped their bags after the lackluster AMA.

The best part of this is that the team never ever hypes stuff.
When they say they have an exciting announcement... you know it's gonna be something worthwhile
Now, while there as many token sales, and many other startups in mobility right now, what sets DOVU apart is that it is well-connected in the transport sector.
In April 2017, DOVU received seed funding from InMotion Ventures, Jaguar Land Roverâ€™s investment arm, and Creative England, a fund backed by the UK Government.Founder and CEO Irfon Watkins is a serial entrepreneur who has founded and sold companies across the API spectrum, including the large-scale ad-platform Coull.
His advisory board includes Lars Klawitter, General Manager of Rolls Royce Bespoke, who is also a director of the Ethereum Foundation, no less.
DOVU also includes co-founder and CMO Arwen Smit, and co-founder and COO Krasina Mileva
