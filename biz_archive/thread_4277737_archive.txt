I'm going with Stealth Coin looking very good right now
Why ask stupid questions>WHo will win BTC or LTC?
The only one winning right now is the exchanges with their fees and then locking your money up so You cant move it without giving up more information.
That's why I am ready for the privacy coins.
Xsh
Where do you buy those privacy coins?
