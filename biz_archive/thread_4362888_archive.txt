If you have 10 million dollars and get a return of invest of only 2% you can live like a king.
If you have 50.000$ and get a ROI of 10% you will stay poor forever and still have to wagecuck till the end of time.
THIS IS NOT FAIR!!!
EXPROPIATE THE RICH!!!
Life isn't fair faggot.
Its easy to become richer when your already rich.
We have to wagecuck till 50 if we are smart and saved/invested we can maybe retire early and when we die leave something for our kids.
Good luck anon.
tfw 10 BTC will not be enough
use money to make money>boomer mentality is that you should start from the bottom without moneyoh gee I wonder who's behind this ideology that deeply effects all boomers
Kill yourselfs for having dumbfuck parents who amounted to nothing faggot.
Since you also amount to nothing its in your genes.
Atleast the works will be happier then without poor people.
Boomers are fucking retards.
You only make money when having money.
The work hard meme is for fucking loosers who have nothing better to do with their lives.
expropriate the rich>become half rich>next generation does the same thing>wealth demolishedGet your money up and stop envying
