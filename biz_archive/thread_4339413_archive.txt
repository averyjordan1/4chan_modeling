So you know the way normies are being BTFO'd on Coinbase?
If I buy Litecoin from Coinbase and send it to an exchange to sell into btc, I can avoid the massive delays and transfer fees right?
That's correct!
Cool thank you
yeah why use ETH when ETH markets exist, when you could just buy litecoin, send it slower, and then sell it off for BTC and pay some fees, then buy your shitcoin.
Sauce, sir.
