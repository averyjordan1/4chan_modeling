I'm in over my head and could use some solid advice:I dropped $500 in bitcoin back during the Jamie Dimon related dip (at around 4k), and then I sold for $900 and felt really happy.
Then several days ago BTC dips to $7200 and the uncertainty of the S2X fork made me think I should get in before 8K.
So I dropped $1,000 like an idiot at 7200.What do I do now to recover?
I can't move the funds into anything because Coinbase has them pending.
I'm ready for episode 2 of "always do what /biz/ says".
hodl, bitcoin is correcting.
stop stressing over nothing.
just chill
Rule number 1 :"never put more than you can afford to lose"But it will eventually get back to +7000 but it will take time.
Get out of crypto until you can handle dips.
That's my honest suggestion.
THEN JUST WAIT YOU FUCKING IDIOT IT'S THAT SIMPLE
solid advice, it takes a stomach for it.
4330134Thanks.I can afford to lose everything I invested, it's just a huge setback in life ofcourse.
Holding for the long run is my only option at this point.
