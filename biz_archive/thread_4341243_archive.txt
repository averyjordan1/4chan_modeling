Hey biz,I'm looking for feedback on my portfolio.
Basically am ~ 35% COSS, 21% BTC, 16.5% REQ, 10.5% MODUM, 8% CFD and the remaining 9% is about half in eth half in shitcoin roulette.I'm pretty new to trading.
Started with $1080 in September and am currently at $620.
Feeling kind of bad about being down 40% and I've definitely made some mistakes (being a fucking retard) along the way.With all that said, how does this split look?
I feel okay about it over the long term but would like some input.
Will I make it if I keep holding what I have now?I don't mean enough to retire, but I'd like to at least have more than I started with in a 3 or 4 months.
Besides BTC they are all shitcoin.. Shitcoins are for holding, or they give you a good profit or they will stay there waiting for moon.
I say this because If you lost something then you sold and bought, this is not longtern.You need to decide if you want the long term game or short term.. day trading usually requires experience and cold blood...A good strategy is holding larger part of your portfolio (80% or 60%) on something slow but stable (Monero, ETH or BTC if you are ok seeing the rollercoaster without selling).. the rest you play along.
Zap.store (still ICO price, will grow soon)NLC2 (same)Dash?
