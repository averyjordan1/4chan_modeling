Probably back to ICO price.
Who cares, this will 10x for the right reasons.. Not from some PBC pump group or other BS.
It will rise because it's going to be a profitable and helpful in the real fuking world
I'd estimate $60m market cap by the end of Q4
somewhere above ICO levels.It really depends on how many pajeets we still have to shake out.
