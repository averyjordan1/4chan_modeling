What happend to obsidian?
Do you remember?
Right out the gates almost we were mooning.
The fudd just got stronger and stronger trying to keep it down.
Going at great lengths to even fake slack screenshots.
These whales got it under a dollar... they got it under 50 cents.
And now are trying to accumulate even moar under 25 cents.
By the time this thing hits $1 again it will shortly go to $4I've been in whale groups long enough to know how to fudd and accumulate for cheap.
>If you're a regular /biz Anon ask yourself this, what purpose does it serve to fudd?
There was no scam, no funny business, no overhyped or broken promises.
This project is one of the few gold mines out here and you haven't bought in at a sub 10 million market cap.
You wanna know how people make 10-20x gains on this board?
It's buying into projects like obsidian this early and this cheap.

Yea this project actually has a legitimate use case (with a need for decentralization).
If the Obsidian team deliver on the app's UI and UX this will be huge.
Private communication as well as payments all in one easy to use app on smart phone?
That will be cryptocurrency at its finest.
Fingers crossed they stick the landingI'm accumulating enough to have a couple master nodes (10k ODN/node which right now is like $2500...a steal).
Father Odin forgive this man.
He knows not what you are
