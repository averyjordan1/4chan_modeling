Anyone use Ameritrade?
Im looking for a simple place to put money in and Daytrade ETFshow good is this shit?
any hidden fees?
2017>paying commision
its specifically says n the website there are 250+ commision-free ETFs thats why I want to use
if you want a serious trading platform, ameritrade offers ThinkOrSwim, which is very good.If you're a 4 figure pleb stick with robinhood.
They have no account min or inactivity fees so sign up and use their platform but execute your trades on robinhood for free.
4313254robinhood doesnt offer what I want to trade
Daytrade ETFsI don't even
There are probably other fees in there, like custodian and maintenance fees
Do people actually day trade ETFs?
Read the terms commission free ETFs must be held for thirty days or you get a charged the regular commission.
sure, if you have a server inside the exchange you can make a bot that shaves off profits between the ETF and it's underlying stocks.
but everybody who can do that has already sucked that opportunity dry.
day to day ETF movement is effectively random, not going to make more money than just holding.
Look into the tastyworks platform.
I think they have all ETFs and have low trade fees.
It's by the same guy who helped design the Think or Swim platform.
lloks more like a bar and grill than an exchange
its a broker, not an exchange.
stop being so fucking stupid.
btw you're never going to be a successful trader.
this.
t_d's the tits.
