Hey guys, reporting back with another Kucoin general.
Confido is still mooning, if you bought since my last Kucoin general you would be up almost 30%.Currently Kucoin is ranked #52 exchange on CMC with about $6.4 million trading volume currently.What is Kucoin?
Kucoin is an exchange that gives 90% of its profits to the users based on their KCS (kucoin) holdings.
KuCoin shares 90% of the trading fees with its usersA Quick rundownKuCoin keeps 10% of the trading bonus feeKuCoin shares 40% to users who invite others to trade on KuCoin via their referral linkKuCoin shares another 50% to users who hold KCS on KuCoin as a KuCoin Bonus!For example, user Bob holds 10000 KCS in his account on our exchange.
In October the average volume of our entire exchange per day is 10000 BTC, according to our current fee rate, the trading fee we collect per day is 20 BTC.
So this user will get 20 * 50% * (10000/100000000) = 0.001 BTC per day, 0.03 BTC per month!By holding NEO on the exchange you earn GASobile App (iOS/Android) in NovemberWill be decentralized in the future with KCS as the fuelEach quarter, KuCoin will buy-back KCS with 10% of profits until 100m KCS is destroyedIf you're a new Kucoiner, sign up here: https://www.kucoin.com/#/signupMy ref: E3gPu4Welcome aboard!
