Ive literally watched hundreds coins moon since 2012.
I have mined and traded many of the coins that mooned but for some reason I have never been that successful.
I always find a way to fuck up whether its selling too low or not putting enough in I can only ever seem to make 2-3 thousand and never really get that 50 or 100k.Am I doomed to be tossing pennies around for my entire life or what the fuck is wrong with me?
You need more leverage my friend.
Riding a 10% move on 10x leverage is an easy double.
You're trying to hard.
Find a few solid picks, buy them low and hold.
Crypto and trading in general has the same skill to luck ratio as poker.
Success and failure is mainly luck based.
You just have shit luck m8.
4459994Thanks for the advice anons.
Much appreciated.
Stop trading, just hold
The problem is to go from 2500 to 50k you have to 20 times your money.
So the price of your coin has to be 20 times what it is when you invest.
This doesn't happen very often.
Dude, the trick is, being at the right place at the right time.
I'm giving you a hint right now, buy some TIO, strong project/ community, German team.
They just got their first listing on Etherdelta exchange, and they'll be listing on Hitbtc and Binance later on, They're yet to be on coinmarketcap.They're just at $ 0.1 at the moment, with a low supply of only 450000 tokens in circulation.
When it gets to coinmarketcap it's going to be pumped to well over $1.
That's just common sense.
Anyways, do your own research and thank me later.
