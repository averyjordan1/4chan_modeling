What's /biz/'s current take on Electroneum?
bump
Just started mining, not sure if any good?
I dont know.

It's a shitcoin with the worst pajeet devs but they were great at hyping it so it was a good ride for pump and dumps some times.It was really funny when they got hacked right after they made claims in the tune of "we're the most secure ever, blowing away everything that has come before in security.
unhackable".
no u
cheap currency
