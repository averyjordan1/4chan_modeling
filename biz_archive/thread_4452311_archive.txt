I'm doing a research paper looking at different price structures and want to know how to accurately tell which price structures are used by which companies and how they are used.
Unfortunately, this is not something of which I have much knowledge at all, and my class did not cover this kind of topic.
I'm looking more specifically for information on ASUS, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and Intel.
Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.Also, while I guess I could do this myself, I do not really trust myself to do a good enough job.
Plus, I do not have all the time in the world for the same reason that led me to reach this phase so late in the semester.
