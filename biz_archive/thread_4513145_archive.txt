The .com bubble went to over 4trillion dollars and that was in the 90's.
In 2018 we have had rappid inflation and currently crypto is only at half a trillion.
Still a ways to go.
Its not even at half a trillion yet.
Like 180 billion tops
Binance needs to add a stop-loss feature, but I think that you're absolutely right.
We probably have a ways to go before the crash.
every successive bubble has to be a dick waving contest with the bubble before it even if the fundamentals are completely differentnice logic my dude
If you take inflation in consideration we are slightly lower than half a trillion: 1 million usd in 2000 equals roughly 1,5 million usd today
Correct and following this analogy I would say we are currently in the year 1986 right now.
we're only at 250 billion just now and thats not even taking into account all the coins that were lost and are no longer in circulating supply.WE ARE GOING 20X MINIMUM BOYS, hope you got at least half a bitcoin by now.
