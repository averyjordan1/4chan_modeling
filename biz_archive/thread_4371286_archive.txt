Account locked for 15 minutes.I'm quite sure I didn't set the 2FA there, so it might be a somekind of numerbs code, maybe a 4 or 6 digits, or something automatically generated, can you tell me more?
It doesn't have 2fa.
Just a code that thy ask you to put.
Since you seem dumb it's probable 123456.
 or 6 digits?I was trying but after 3 fails they locked my account for 15 minutes.Iol not 123456
i think they said choose one between 6 and 8.
It should be written down right next to ur PW lol
>Please choose a 4-8 digit PinCodeOk, so 4 to 8...Nice, I use different codes from 4 to 6 at least, I will spend few hours I guess...
