The new REQ update states they are in "regular contact" with Chainlink to be a decentralized oracle provider.REQ is partnered with iExec.iExec should blow up next year if we are not a doomed world.If you are not balls deep in this holy trinity of coins you are fucking blowing it, my friends.The reality of at least one of these, if not all three of these blowing up is a very likely scenario.Don't blow it.xo
sorry, in regular contact to "POSSIBLY" be an oracle provider, before you all go apeshit on me.
you know that shit is gonna happen.
ok. out.
You should add to the mix :ark, rise, neo and etherium.
You will have moon dogs
Fuk I actually agree with a anon for once.
This threesome is gonna make sweet love a produce a 10 Billion dollar market cap baby by August of next year.
Haha.
Thanks.
I have so much shit to get done but thought making this new meme would prove useful in the future.
Will save it for future moon missions.
NEO should to great things, but I took some profit, and am re-investing in this trinity of the Gods.
Even when NEO hits $100, my paltry entry to NEO, compared to parsing it out to these three will pale in comparison, in my opinion.
Cheers.
iExec is going to moon fucking hard.
Even with the threat of the flippening coming again with BCC above 1.2, iExec has a huge change of mooning 5 fold in the near future and draining golems market cap.
We will make it, bruh
