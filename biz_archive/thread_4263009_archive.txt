By what magical mechanism would USDT pump BTC?
You do understand people sell BTC to buy USDT because they anticipate BTC losing value against USD
Let me explain you brainlet, the FUD against Bitfinex tethers is that they dont have enough fiat to back up the amount of tethers they print out.
Some believe that Bitfinex is a huge whale.
If the FUD is true then they can go on an infinite long position enough to raise billions in BTC's marketcap get it?
Then they dump on the people that FOMO because of the pump they started.
SHUT IT DOWN.
OY VEY!4263015>By what magical mechanism would USDT pump BTC?
You do understand people sell BTC to buy USDT because they anticipate BTC losing value against USDJust like in fiat monies.
BFX tethers aren't backed by shit
This conspiracy is chemtrails tier
Found the jew.
You think its a coincidence BFX are exiting the market?
They don't want the SEC, the only serious auditor in the world, in their books
because you only get 2x coins for the amount of bitcoin you happened to have at a certain time when 2x took the snapshot to go on from.
Nice, would racemix/10
You're doing it wrong.BTC was at 7'500 because the 1'500 were FREE.That means btc price was 6'000 + 1'500.That's were it's going.
Doesn't make any sense
People were ok to buy btc at 7'500 because they knew they would have 1'500$ bonus for free.People wanted to sell their 1'500$ worth of s2x, that means they spent 7'500, sold their s2x for 1'500, only spent 6'000 and still had a full btc.Are you indian ?
it fucking does.
he's saying futures had b2x at 1500, you were to get a b2x for having a btc, not anymore though
