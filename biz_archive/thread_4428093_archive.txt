How are you sure you'll get to the moon?
We have all invested in a different coin with an equal confidence in its potential.
What makes you think your decision was the right one?
It's barely mentioned on this boardI've seen maybe three to five threads about it, read the white paper, read people's pros and cons behind it and dived in.Pajeets behave and act a certain way so it's easy to sniff them out and steer clear of anything they're involved in.
it tends to work out for me pretty well.
We will all moon alongside BCH
sniff out the poos
have all invested in a different coin with an equal confidence in its potential.Oh that's simple - most of /biz/ are idiots as of 3 months ago.
Even if I'm wrong about a particular coin, I can count on the rest of /biz/ is going to be wronger because of the way they all jump on bandwagons and believe rumors of partnerships and hype.
Consistently going all in on a whim.That doesn't mean that my decision was the right one, but I can very easily not feel FOMO and not fall for FUD when seeing /biz/ and Pajeets crowing about other coins.
