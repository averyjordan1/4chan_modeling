Put your heads together and let's find a way to get me rich
I have tried it two years ago on few popular games (not on wow), but the bot detection + marginal gains (because to many chinese factories are doing the same) makes it barely profitable.
Like 3/4 dollars an hour, wasn't worth it.Don't know if WOW is different though.
I already live in tropics
guaranteed way to get rich, we hacked the system
What do you study which does not give you time for 10-20 hours a week of work?

Fuck off you lazy piece of shit.There's 168 hours in a week.
56 hours of sleep is more than enough, that leaves 112.
You can't tell me you spend 112 hours on studying.
I told you about qsp, OP.
You didn't listen.
Okay, I can symphatize with you.Check this coin called Confido.
It's a bit hard to get, but it's in a nice dip and propably will do a 10x soon.
With a stash as small as yours I suggest you go all in.Not much but it'll help in future moon missions.
HAHhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

Stick it all in on ETP and wait for it to moon,Look for other promising new coins/tokens after it moons and then repeat.
Trade, all your holding is already mooned
Op, take a look at Vechain.
Huge partnerships, low marketcap and big things planned for 2018.

Go for POWR as soon as it dips a little.Also GVT.
DVA is a fucking pajeet scam lol
4483114All "pump groups" are Pajeet scamsâ€”that's how they work.
Want to make money that way?
Get 5 friends together and make a private group, then make a second "pump group" who you dump on.
Best post

>I want to live in the tropicsJust give me a green card/blue card and I'll give you my house and my wife.
I'm in a similar position.
I'm looking for those etherdelta hidden gems that might 5x-10x.
Get a job, put some money every week into your trading account, learn how to trade, try to make at least 1% a day gains on your trading (not just the value that the market adds to your coins) win more than you lose, become a real trader...
Become a man!
>was in the same position as OP>bought POWR and sold it at 2.5xHardly made it, but one step forward.
IOP (not a super low mcap but low nonetheless) is a low mcap coin that is getting news soon, might do a nice 3-4x.
Also the most important thing I've seen so far is to not listen to /biz/ bagholders, I may have sold POWR right before a bear trap but I don't care, I'm out with my 2.5x gain and it's secured, now I have more money to invest in other coins and repeat.
Fuck bagholding, even if I wanted to stay in POWR, I could just have bought the dip again and I'd be in with more than I was before I sold.
Just HODL.
he doesn't know

Alternatively, sell half of your stack when you're up +100% and hold until a target price.
When it goes parabolic at the end of a huge week-long run like it did yesterday, dump.
Simple.
