i'm making between 1500-1600 a month and only getting about 1,250 back.
that's a 23%-24% tax wtf is this?
i'm not in that bracket mine should be capped at 17.5% I work in PA
sorry meant to say 1,500-1,600 per paycheck which is biweekly.
still well under the 20%+ bracket
this is what tax refunds are for dummy
You have to pay the tithing you ungrateful goy
Talk to your HR and ask to raise the number of exemptions.Raise it much higher.You are overpaying.Yeah, you can get a refund at end of year, but fuck waiting for that.
get back to work
Post the breakdown from your withholdings for FICA, state vs fed income tax, health insurance, etc.
Then we will have a better idea if you should decrease or increase your withholdings
good goy
PAY OR WE WILL KILL YOU
% goes to state tax and you're probably paying at least 1% local, so your fed withholdings are 19-20% which sounds about right since you're probably retarded and put 0 down on your w4
You would die in European tax-system
if you short term trade less than one year crypto your going to get rekt hahah pay the jew
Dawg I make 100k a year aka roughly 4150 biweekly and I take home 2650.
I get fucking linked by Uncle Sam.
Single no exemptions etc etc but fuck me man 36%
If you genuinely have no exemptions, what number are you suggesting you put down?
And are you pulling this out of your ass or are there defensible reasons for this number?
I work in St. Louis.
The other day some Housekeeping niggers were eating in our break-room.
They were chatting to each other in their monkey speak about how they scam the gov and get like 10 IRS refunds a year by stealing ID's.
