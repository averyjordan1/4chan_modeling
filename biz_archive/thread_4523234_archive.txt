I was thinking of depositing money sometime now in the end of November to buy sub 350$ eth and sub 70$ ltc, but now it seems it's too fucking late, and pretty sure once I'll load up my balance and buy them, they're gonna drop
so wait for the dip and post wojacks when it doesn't come or buy immediately and wojack when it dipsyour choice
What the fuck, its a lose/lose then, isnt it?
ha ha
Use limit orders then faggot
Buy BCH, in a day you will witness epic gains.
