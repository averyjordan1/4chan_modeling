Does anyone have any advice for arbitrage trading using cryptocurrencies?Currently I have a program written that will trade between Poloniex, GDAX, and Gemini.
My issue is currently that when I move ETH, it takes about 2 mins to actually trade (well, way longer on Poloniex).
Currently the delay is too much, and it kind of defeats the whole purpose.
Do any of you here in /biz/ do arbitrage trading with cryptos and have any advice?
Wouldn't you want to keep stacks of USD/ETH/BTC/BCH on each exchange?Then you can instantly buy up on exchange A, sell off on exchange B, then, with some time and transaction fees, rebalance.
See, I've thought about doing that.
I have no rebuttal against that, but would I have to keep both BTC/ETH on every exchange or just one of the two?
Depends if you're consistently buying off one exchange, like it's got really good prices or something.
Then your flow is going to be mostly one way.Really though, you should run the numbers on transaction and trading fees.
Check your margins, see how much volume you need to push.
That'll matter more than min-maxing your wallet balances.

transaction fees are so high on most exchanges you can't make a profit from it.1.5 % tx fee means there has to at least be a 1.5% price difference.for bitcoin that'd be ~ $100 differential to break even.
(Donate my consulting fees to a local animal shelter)Can do, but I have to make the money first.One last question, is there an exchange that confirms faster than others?
This is definitely viable with ETH having a confirmation time of 20 seconds or so, but are there any exchanges that will confirm faster than others?
