How long does a thing have to go on for people to stop calling it "a bubble"?
When it becomes the new normal.
But then you need to see some sort of normalization of price levels, because otherwise you're stuck in a loop of making money while everyone who isn't involved tells you that you got lucky or you're going to fuck it up somehow, because we love to see successful people get fucked.
I mean BTC goes to a million dollars the next year, everyone will bitch about bubble blablabla, but it's kind of moot once you've withdrawn your initial investment and enough money to get by for some time.
You know the old saying, "don't invest more than you can afford to lose"?
Thats how you deal properly with a potential bubble.
Peopls who follow that rule and lose in a bubble get very disappointed.
It's the fuckards who throw their whole savings at a potential bubble and take out a second mortgage so they can invest double who end up getting royally screwed over.
