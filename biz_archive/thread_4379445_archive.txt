Crypto currencies are just another bubble with no real value and based totally on speculation.
Due to government crack downs and failure to break into the mainstream financial markets there will be a crash and they will be worthless by 2020Why am I wrong?
Why am I wrongBecause you can't stop progress.
>Religious persecution ended, we thrived>Slavery ended, we thrived>Human rights emerged, we thrived>Inflationary economies and debt slavery will end, and we will thriveInflationary economies only worked for so long because of the population boom.
You could keep on printing money nonstop, there would always be more and more people working and consuming, so it worked out.
That is no longer our reality.
these models are spiraling down:>No massive increase in population>No decent increase in consumption>Means less room for expanding businesses>Means less jobs>Means less taxes collected>Means governments will print out more money to pay the bills and increase taxes on existing products>Means less purchasing powerIt's a snowball.
This model has failed and needs reworking.
We'll be switching to a deflationary model soon enough
Means less jobsFewer.
fine, I have cashed out by then anyway
Do your own research, stop making these lazy ass 'Le prove me wrong' threads hoping someone will explain it to you.
