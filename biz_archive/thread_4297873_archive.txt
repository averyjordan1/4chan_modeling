BTC Core has won the battle of the Bitcoins> Cash deemed useless> Bitcoin is the global currency> Tax comes straight out of your balance automatically > Blockstream runs most of the world after being promised limitless riches from their elitist financial supporters> Wallets can be frozen or locked> Transactions trace back to your microchip input in your wrist at birth> Transaction fees, interest rates and taxes are so high that it is impossible to have more than just enough coins to feed yourself > Due to global govournment controlling what you consume on the media, you believe this is a good and wonderful thing> all because you didn't buy BCH
 >bitcoin core is now worth 0.1USD>development team disbanded>blockstream declared bankruptcy 10 years ago>bitcoin (aka bitcoin cash)1,000,000 USD per bitcoin
Bitcoin will be the mark of the beast.Without the microchip implanted in you, you wont be able to buy and sell
ripple, omisego, xem have the mark of the beast
i'm always thinking about this because anything the Jews will use to bring the end times is something that will be a moon missionbut once you get there it sucks b/c jews
People will oppose them with other moon missions, the tide is changing.
Choose wisely in the future.
2030>Bitcoin Cash became the global currency>Jihan Wu controls 99% of the hashrate>abandons blocks by any other miner>sets the fee however he likes>most powerful man in the world>occasionally demands a clip of you fucking your mother to let your transaction through
The year is 2025
