Ethereum is so much better of a technology than all of the Bitcoin forks combined.
We've been in the biggest bull pennant ever that is about to be broken out of next week.Neither BTC or BCH will survice the rise of ETH.

Eth is fucking awesome.
I'm not betting on it though.
ETH price not going anywhere until parity wallet issue is resolved.
If hard fork is done to release the funds then ETH price will collapse.

NEO is superior.
