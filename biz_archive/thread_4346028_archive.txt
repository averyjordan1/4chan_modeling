Everyone was ignoring sleeper alts while the BTC/BCH war was happening.
Don't miss the LBRY Credits dip.
The new client was just released and the price hasn't reacted yet.
tfw been margin trading alts all week and made more then I would have if I just focused on the BTC/BCH war, This is turning into my most profitable week.
That is because the price will never react again.
Too bad no one gives a shit.
Seriously, LBRY is about as useless as a useful program can get?
Ya dig?
Ya understand?
No one in crypto cares about useful stuff.
We only care about pajeet tech dreams and investing in vapor dreams.
Listen, anon.Listen to me.
I invested in synereo AMP last year and held until August of this year.

Don't fuck with apps.Protocols and infrastructure coins are where it's at in this market.
DON'T fuck with apps.
They're way more risky and way less fundamental than protocols
