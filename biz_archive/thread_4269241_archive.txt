You should have saved your money on regular banks to protect the value of your savings like any smart people would doHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHASponsored by (((them)))

I appreciate this post so much.
It's like you could write for the show anon.
Will it be pro BTC, or anti BTC do we think?
And is this good, or bad?
My anxiety is rising.
I think someone will find bitcoin and sell them.Which is not good for BTC because it could mean that people see it as a missed train, and that it won't go up much more.Best scenario would be somehow for them to recommend people to buy BTC, but that's not funny
written by Chuck Lorre (Charles Michael Levine) I wonder what stance will it have
true, I'm gonna be so happy in a few years
SELL THE NEWS
Extended PlotThe guys find a laptop which has some virtual bitcoin currency on it.
The computer belongs to Penny's old boyfriend Zack.http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/The_Bitcoin_Entanglement
Doesn't matter if its pro or anti, it's going to bring awareness to basically every normie.
nice find
ZIMBABWE
ZILLIQA
i guess zack will get rich eventually which would make the episode pro.zack is a guy just gets into the show now and then hes pretty stupid which would fit the typical dumb lucky guy.
Leonard, I used that old hard drive you left on the counter to store blue ray rips of Star Trek .
Bazooka!
4270986or this... yeah we just have to wait hope anyone posts it here soon, there is not enough mooning possible to make me watch another episode of this bullshit
thinking about it, it would be ironic that the "nerds" didn't have as much bitcoin as a guy who can barely type on a laptop.
And pretty fake actually
Gabagool!
anyway normies will see a dumb guy holding a possible fortune so they will get in on it too, expect mooning

Lambinga
BAGINGA
you sold my used panties online?
Zaaaack that's disgusting!
the episode goes on to win 5 daytime Emmys
By that logic normies would have just emulated Nintendo games instead of autistically screeching about how difficult it is to get an snes mini.
BOJUNGA
