Whys link shitting it's pants today.
Scared it's gonna drop below 15c.
people are dumping it for NEO, no lie
This, people wanna get a few bucks from NEO, then come back to LINK with some extra profits.
don't be scurred.
you bought link because you thought it would go higher when you bought it.
if it doesn't then a bad trade is a bad trade but in this market anything can happen.
link has good fundamentals and i highly doubt it'll have a market cap less than ripple's once it goes live but until that happens expect bleeding.
Just start trading small amounts.
I just started and I already made $430 in a day from two trades
If Link hit Ripple's mcap how much would each link be worth?
around 30 dollars.
That's why I'm still holding my 10k links.
with current marketcap around 24 dollars
Are you not worried you'll miss out on moon mission?
I don't think LINK should go higher than monero desu, but then again ripple shouldn't either.
Pretty much this.
They are not going to announce anything specially during the weekend.Just try to jump on any alt raising and buy more link on Monday.
Fuck this shit, I'm ignoring crypto until summer.
I get too pissed when other coins moon.
