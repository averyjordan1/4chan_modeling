JUST
All within a half hour?
yeah you deserved that.. haha don't follow the damn pump.
except the last time BCH got pumped for 300%..i have no idea what's right or wrong anymore
I really hate this fucking coin.
Every time I lose money it's because of this one.>brb take a 10% loss, make multiple other 5%+ trades to recover.
Buy back in and -10% again.I think I'll just never trade it, it's not worth the stress and annoyance.
99% of the time, you'll alway get fucked chasing a pump1% of the time, you'll actually get lucky and make a few bucks by jumping in and out at the right time.-that being said, OP think with your head not your dick.
Accumulate and hold for 50 fucking hours
every time
Best MEME of the day, so far
