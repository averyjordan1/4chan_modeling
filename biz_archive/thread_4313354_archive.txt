Good evening /biz/.
I admit, I have learned a lot from you guys; the more brilliant of you lot are complete angels giving links to goings on an imminent moon mission.
I'm going not even going to care about my ego at this point, you see, I have been fighting a terrible mixture of depression and insomnia for the past year.
But basically I missed quite a few hours of sleep - more than I should have.
I got myself phished thinking I was going to get an airdrop.
I feel so stupid, but a necessary mistake perhaps.
The world isn't over, I still have a roof over my head and a career to look forward to.
Before this lad tries to sleep once more, all I ask for is someone kind enough to reunite me with some Chainlink (LINK), whether it be 1 block or whatever quantity.
