So I was checking out the Order Book on Golem GNT.
Just to make sure I understand this correctly:Which such a high number of Asks compared to Bids, and a low volume, is it safe to assume that:1) Nobody really wants this right now2) It might be more difficult to sell because of so few buyers?
New to this and just trying to see if I get it.
Or 3) Artificial wall put up to manipulate price?
