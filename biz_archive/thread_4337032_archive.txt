What if BCH is just a double bluff / scam by Jihan and Roger Ver to shake out BTC weakhands and get cheap BTC?What if the plan was never to kill BTC?
Whatever happens with BTC/BCH, Ethereum will come out of this as the winner in a few months.
Just wait until China gets back into the game> MOOOOOOOOB
I have held my Eth since 30 USD (thanks Biz for shilling on Pol) and used 2/3rds of it to make more money.It just sits there now at 300 dollars, and I think of all the gains I've missed, but I'm holding.
Eth --- do something.
and I think of all the gains I've missed,>up 1000%>still FOMOingjust count yourself lucky you're not one of those weakhands
can only base decisions on evidence otherwise you may as well be a schizophrenic living in the parkthere's evidence to the contrary of bch being dumped
