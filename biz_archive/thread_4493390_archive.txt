What do u all think will happen to Alt Coins on the 10th of December when CME futures go live?
Massive wedge been forming for the whole year on various large cap coins.Example.NEO/BTC ETH/BTC
there will be so much market manipulation on btc that altcoins will moonerino
That is possible.
Maybe everything will moon because so much money will flow into the market?
Or maybe a 500 billion short will enter the market.hmmmm.

Alts are going to crash as BTC goes to the fucking sun.
Don't be a retard anon.
When have alts ever risen with the price of BTC for more than a few hours?
those (((investors))) are going short bitcoin, maybe not at first but you mark my fucking words and screencap this.
The futures market allows them to bet on bitcoin without actually owning any.
They will take a short position, and attempt to tank the price of bitcoin.
i.e (((George Soros))) I believe that they may be able to pull it off too.
Im not trying to spead FUD here, just saying that we will need to keep a VERY close eye on this, these motherfuckers are soulless.
For them to make money, somebody has to lose money.
