I got about $22 worth of monero from mining with my crappy graphics card.
I am a broke college student.
What should I do now?
Use that money to buy weed.

I dunno but why are college kids so fucking retarded these days?
Should you be out slaying pussy sucking or football players?Youâ€™re literally spending your free time asking about what to do with $22 worth of crypto.
Are they not teaching you anything in college?
