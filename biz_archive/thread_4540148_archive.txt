should i sell my monero for now?
if you want to go for the big gains - yes and buy REQ.
if you like just getting steady and relatively safe value - NO
desu I never sell my XMR.tfw I already have REQ too.I'm goinna sell some litecoins soon
Why would you sell now and not have sold at $170?
It's having a slight correction and consolidation before it continues on.Hold now.
Wanting to drop XMR...How weak can your hands be?
Just a correction
just a little bit worried that it actually might drop more
