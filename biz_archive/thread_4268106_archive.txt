"May you live in interesting times" - Chinese Curse (Source not confirmed)Time is a bitch, I had to travel for couple of days and this crazy shit happened.
All plan for Nov 16 went in vain, now I have lost my portfolio.
All my predicted ALTS actually did well/ too late to get in now.
I am left with 0.5 BTC.
/BIZ please help me recover.I Need info on which one coin I can enter now - looking for just 30-40% profit nothing more.
(of-course I will do my due diligence)"If you ask for something, first give them something" - Barter systemMost of my predictions are already gone , i Missed them .
the only things I am left out Long Term : - Metaverse - ask me how ?, with your suggestion and reason.Working product- Solar Alternate Thinking:Neo - Increased Circulating supply and liquidated the coin value a bit.
But its a good move.
ask me how?
with your suggestion.Coin to ignore:REDD coin - IOTA has introduced tipping and by nature of IOTA it is built for IOT application (that doesnt mean iota will raise).
But in case any tipping coin grows surely its not REDD as many others entered the market (still they are creating REDD ID... lol).Not as expected coins:OMG - Dont expect this coin to grow like Neo.
Their development is very slow.
no more apple logo and thailand bank shit can help them.
but it will maintain a decent price.Tired of typing, let start discussing.
