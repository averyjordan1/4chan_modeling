Hello all, I remember a while back some anon made a thread saying Decentraland was shilled to him at a Barcelona conference.
Claimed he was all in and that devs were telling him the price will most likely 30-40x based on speculation alone due to the upcoming announcements and partnerships.
It was most likely a LARP but I've held a position for a while but there seems to be no hype for this shit.
should I drop my bag for something else?
You bought a shitcoin for 'virtual world'.The devs literally have no experience in game design.I remember when I bought like 10 ETH worth at ICO and sold for some retard on Etherdelta for 30%.That is this shitcoin was for.
