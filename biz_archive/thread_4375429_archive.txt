I sold all BCH came out with 300$gains and holding it in Tether until this shit blows over for now.
I am not sure what to buy at this moment

This.
Correction for BTC is still not over.
Don't FOMO buy on a sudden temporary spike resulting from a short lived news head fake.
I made 12k off of BCH, could not possibly be at a loss.
Bought this btc rally up until I think it will dump, then I'll be right back in bch

Don't worry about fluctuations every 10 minutes.
>he will buy btc now when its high and just himself when it dropsJust here waiting for wojaks now.
because he is a mentally challenged cash fag anon
https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficultyHere it states much lower hashrate
but that's wrong... BTC transactions are getting clogged again check the unconfirmed transaction count.Will not be long before 5 - 10$ fees is normal topkek.
Jihan's move with DAA was brilliant he's now permenantly stealing 25 -50% of all hashing power.
Any increase for BCH will make things worse again btw.
