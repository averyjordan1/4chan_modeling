POWR is mooning!!
It's been mooning the whole week.I regret not listening to the shill posts when it was 15 cents and listening to everyone calling this a scamcoin.Oldfagbiztardmsaidmthis was a 10x mission the other day and he never fails with his btc price predictions ever so I decided to go all in.
Hope this keeps going for a while.
Doesn't matter anyways most of /biz/ calls are PnD so you lose 80% of the time even if they did have massive pumps.
Where's that pic from kek
look stuff up your self wtf is is wrong with you, you though a coin with that team was a scam?
the fuck
Where will it stop guys.
Daddy needs a lambo.
All coins have teams and the supply kinda turned me off when I checked the CMC the first time.
A good comparison is EOS.
We have a higher circulating supply with a slightly lower token count.
Which goes up to 1bil (not handed out yet)Meaning we could hit $2 tomorrow if there were enough orders.
Iâ€™m scared, guis
i hope you guys collected profitsit's falling
Just a minor correction, it's back on the way upperfect time to snag some more before interstellar travel
