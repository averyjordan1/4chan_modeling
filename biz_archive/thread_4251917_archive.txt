I was too much of a normie dumbfuck barhopping idiot back in 2011-2013 and didn't buy any Bitcoins (BTC) whilst it was near its low range and now I feel like I've missed the greatest bull run in all of human history.
Whilst I was nutting inside 5/10 plain-jane college girls at night and wagecucking during the day, BTC was quietly fucking consolidating and I disregarded it for over 5 years JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP now I have no money no job no gf no private residence /biz/ why am I such a failure is it because I have inferior genes or shall I just try NoFap and see if it can get me out of this hole of debt and misery and malaise.
Stop wallowing in self-pity and fix your situation.
Earn money and invest in crypto.
You are not too late.
