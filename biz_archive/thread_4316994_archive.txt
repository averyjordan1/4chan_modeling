nocoiner brainlet here.
About to buy 1 whole bitcoin.
Anyone want to talk me out of it?
welcome to the shitstorm
NoWelcome to hell
do not buy bitcoin it is likely to loose all hashpower tomorrow after the bch hard fork
but its starting to go back up
btc is kill
Things will never be the same.
Be sure to keep away from Chinese imitations
should've done it at $5700
don't forget to buy some lube while you're at it
hahahahahahahahahaha Good luck, the money you lose will be worth the ride and depression.
Don't do it now if this would be your first transaction
do what you want man but if you don't know what chain death spiral is you're gonna have a bad time
No Burger, you must buy Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin wirr die tomorrow, don't get reft hording de bag.
when?
Wait for few days and see where this goes.
Highly risky to buy now
Wait till tomorrow and when BTC hits $4700.Everyone's jumping ship for now because it's better to mine BCC.Tomorrow the difficulty goes up so that's when you wanna do it.
Yeah OP it is a good idea to buy the dip.
Zoom out on the chart and realize the BTC honey badger cannot be stopped.
This is the final challenge to BTC before it moons, big money will be coming in next year and the interest is in the true BTC not the minercoin.
thats what everyone thinks will happenthats why you buy btc now
Who buys BTC during this shitfest, really?Bithumb is up again, looks like BCH's going for another bullrun fuck.
but it might go up a bunch
