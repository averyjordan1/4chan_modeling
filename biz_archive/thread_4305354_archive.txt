>leverage trading BCH% gainz already who here comfy af ?
Where can I leverage trade BCH?
Sell to break even OP this may go way higher but it will come crashing down in a heavy correction.Once you sell to your break even point then do w/e BCH is going to go up i think.
If I wasnt balls deep all in COSS i'd buy some BCH but alas Good Gains wished to you.
I feel like this is my ticket to lambo land and I'm fomod super hard.
I hope i don't get JUSTed in the end
