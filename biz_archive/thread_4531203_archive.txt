What does it feel like senpai?
Similar to molly/adderall?I am talking about meth and coke
ecstasy is its own thing, use only for raves and similaradderall and meth, in my expieriece of using both frequently, are basically exactly the same.
Meth is stronger and you can smoke it, but more neaurotixic.
In regaurds to the feeling, they feel the same.
I couldnt tell the difference if you gave me a meth pill vs an addrall
