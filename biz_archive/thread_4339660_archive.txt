Anon, did you miss CFD and HST?This one could be the next x5.
Not yet listed on Coin Market Cap, so it's still early to jump in now.The name is Emphy.
The code is EPY.
CFD and HST are still on a moon mission, but EPY is a very good fresh moon mission.
I'm in!

4339690I think people are currently too focused on HST and CFD, so Emphy is not getting any attention.But it's okay, eventually people will find out, 'cause Emphy could really be big as it's more undervalued and cheaper than HST right now.
I should've used better wording.
So sorry for the confusion, anon.It's listed on CMC, but as you can see the market cap is not showed yet, so people can't really estimate its worth right now.
