Around 5 cents per LMC currently.
I think it is hugely undervalued though and it might go x 5 or x 10 in the next months.
They are working on so many things but they like to keep it in the shadow before releasing stuff unlike other crypto.https://medium.com/@lomostar/an-open-letter-by-ceo-xiong-lijian-before-the-launch-of-lomostar-2-0-d6c198b04562What I can think of off the top of my head that they also have their own blockchain where their research team F5 is already working with more than 100 businesses in China, going to launch their own exchange at www.xstar.io, already have a functional product which you can download at the Google Store (airdropping a lot), documentary of their office coming soon (finally), and going to do an OTC integration and other stuff on their app, and much more.
So I think that the event money is a lot already, but if you win money in this event you can later on make even more if you just hold it
