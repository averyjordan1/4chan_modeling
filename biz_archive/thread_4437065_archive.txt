New to trading since I just got a decent job.
Is ethereumwallet or coinbase good for me to download and buy?I have lurked for a few days and it seems like NEO and LINK are what I am going to give a shot.
How do I do that?
This faggot is going to be holding bags before the weekend is out.
Google it
Pretty much.
Is that bad?Plan to drop some money on LINK and hold until mid 2018, since apparently that's the advice for that.
Have to lurk way more to do the buying and selling in minutes deal.I did, but wanted to see if you had any pointers I could use, too.
Even telling me what to google could help
