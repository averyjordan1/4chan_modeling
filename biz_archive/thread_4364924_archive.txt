If Coinbase were to support both buying and selling of BCH ...
Does that make it moon?
Need to know to figure out whether I drop my BCH bags.
everyone who has their BCH locked up on coinbase can sell their bags
yeah, isn't there a EURO/USD based Coinbase competitor set to release in 2018 that also has BCASH, DASH and 0x ?
If Coinbase announces buy and sell support of any coin, it will undoubtedly moon.They have hinted at maybe adding a buying option for BCH, but nothing certain.
Might happen, might not happen.
Their current plan is to only support withdrawals but they said if that changes they'd say so.
Either way it could very well be that this last BCH pump was to set a new floor for BCH so people don't dump it when it goes live.
Look at BTC's chart and let me know if you think it's gonna drop.
If the answer is yes, then keep your BCH.
This is literally the only reason why I'm still holding onto this shitcoin.
No fucking clue.
Could go either way from the looks of it.
everyone who has their BCH locked up on coinbase can sell their bagsCoinbase doesn't even have them anymore, and they will vanish before they ever give people their rightful BCH.
Na coinbase has higher standards.
Even pedocoin is preferable to some chineese btc knockoff.
Haven't they committed to releasing them by Jan 1?
Not if they MtGox themselves first...
people won't all dump, they'll see how much its grown in value since the fork and just hodl it

Whereas before this pump they probably would've sold, some may think twice about it.But most people on coinbase probably have no idea what Bitcoin cash is and won't even know they got some.
What's an exchange that actually functions correctly unlike Kraken?
And fuck coinbase fees, In US
Interesting.
Its a natural hedge against btc
