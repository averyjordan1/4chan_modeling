these digital coins are the same as penny stocks of the late 90's early 2000's.
99% are scams and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the same people that orchestrated pump and dumps back then and ran shell companies are now behind most of these internet coins.
I hope you gullible retards lose everything.
no shit sherlock, and just like back then, there were diamonds in the rough.
Man you're really smart.
Did you figure that out by yourself?
le my coin is more legitimate and a diamond in the rough because i have done dd and research and because i own it memeno sherlock they are all shit
