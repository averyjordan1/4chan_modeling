As a successful investor who's managed to transform $15k into 43 cents during the last month alone, I thought I'd provide some trading advice for my fellow /biz/raelis.Since the end goal is to maximize losses, preferably by buying high and selling low, you want to ensure you invest in coins that: (1) have already mooned x10, x20 or x100 beyond their ICO price,(2) are already in the process of a significant upswing (10% increase in 24 hours is good, 800% increase is better),(3) have no news on the horizon, and(4) have a dev team whose LinkedIn Profiles are clearly fraudulent.Unfortunately, this is easier said than done due to the unpredictability of the market.
For example, I recently spent $1k on an ERC20 token called Hive.
Since it was already up 500% on EtherDelta, I figured it would provide me with some juicy red candles.Imagine my disgust, then, when the price continued to go UP after my purchase.
I broke into a cold sweat and desperately tried to sell, but no one was buying.You can only imagine how awful that night was, watching with abject horror as my Blockfolio increased in value and remaining unable to do anything about it.Thankfully, my Confido losses (7k lost in less than an hour) made up for the Hive gains, but it was still a tough few days.So, let that be my final piece of advice: be careful.
What goes down can also go up, and only gamble with what you're willing to gain.
only gamble with what you're willing to gain.I like you.
Let's be friends.

let's not forget.. confido can happen to anyone -- with a brain injury or down syndrome.
