>still 471995 millions unprocessed btc transactions>bitmain supporting bitcoin cash onlyIts just a big dip bros. keep pumping
Nobody is moving Bcash outside exchanges, it's a blatant pump and dump.
When all this Bitcoins finally get processed, there will be a huge Bcash pump.
Whales are probably thanking their lucky stars for the dip so they don't have to buy too high.
Miners wouldn't migrate to Bitcoin Cash just for a PnD.

You're retarded
>i-its a big dipLiterally more than 50% down :D Its a dump
exchange with 70% of volume goes down>it's a dumpReady your pink wojak for when Bitthumb goes back online and this thing hits 0.5
