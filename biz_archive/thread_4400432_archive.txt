It makes sense that in the future there will be one or more porn-centered coins that are used for tipping/buying shows form cam models, paying for subscriptions, even paying prostitutes, etc.
It's an industry ripe for tech advancement in which customers want anonymity.But which coin will win?
Right now there's FAP, TIT, SEX, and others.
Doesn't seem to be much difference and I can't find any major announced partnership.
Which one do you think will win and why?
Or is the whole idea of an adult-industry coin stupid and people will just use regular cryptos, which will provide all the anonymity needed?Shill me.
Monero, obviously
I own Monero and I agree with you to an extent, but I have a hard time envisioning Monero being used for small time transactions like this.
Main problem is it is not at all user-friendly right now.
It's too complicated for normies to adopt.
Maybe future developments will fix that.
