You want to explain yourself or just shout out shit?
Tone Vays said it himself in his last video with Jimmy Song on yt, this feels like 2013 to him and he's a bitcoin veteran.
2014 was a magical time for BTC.
But remember this, OP - it was a black swan anomaly.
Between that spike at 26 and the recovery at 53, you had:Pirate bay closed and wallets seizedMT Gox collapseSell off of FBI lootsAll of this when the user base and market was fucking tiny.

He'd lie down and take a nap to shake off the venom from the snakes, but they couldn√§t keep him down.
except one huge difference - institutions are lining up to get in the game.
anyone not realizing the next few years are the vertical part of the S-curve is going to miss out on unfathomable gains

4486282You go right on and keep believing this meme.
The smart money has already pulled out.
unfathomable gainsHow many times do I have to explain to you people that holding something like Ripple and ETH from just February until now would have given you more gains than if you held Bitcoin from now until it somehow equals the entire supply of money in the entire world?You are better off holding more volatile assets you retarded fucks.
Bitcucks have become the annoying stockfags praying for baby gains.
This.Been in Ripple since March.
WAY better gains than BTC.
Institutional money is going to make this a 1 trillion market capinstitutional money didn't become one by luckthey will short the fuck out of btc and will succeedyou know why?
