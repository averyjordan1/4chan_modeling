I feel like BTC will either break a giant double bottom or not match the prior low and go up higher - either way I think that's the right date for the event.
Bitcoin is a ticking time bomb ad there's no decentralized scaling options.
Idk if it'll be the 22,nd, but you're going to see increasing momentum from bitcoin cash eating away market share.
whenever BTC's difficulty adjusts is when it will happen, and what will happen is the end of (((blockstream))) and corecoin at the hands of Roger "Small Block Holocaust" Ver
it's the head of the head and shoulders, the very peak of the Bit-Con scheme scam.
the bear emerges from hibernation.
