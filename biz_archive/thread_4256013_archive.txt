Is a career on banking a good job Or people working in banks will just be replaced by robots/artificial inteligence/home banking?
I am studying a technicature in banking gestion but I'm unsure if it will be viable in the future..I started to pannick and now I just researching to becone a plumber..
We will all be replaced.
The entire human race.
Maybe but, some jobs will be replaced early than others... maybe a plumber will be replaced when I reach 70myears old, when I reach 70 I will not give a fuckBut if I get replaced at 45..
I will be fucked

Thats retarded, banks are funding fintech and blockchain related start ups where I live..
soon they're all replaced through decentralized money.
Bitcoin is not decentralized anymore, there are big players minning in china and I dont remmember the other country.Do your research.Im not talking about cryotho in this thread, Im talking about home banking and Artificial inteligence
blockchain technology extends much further than simple bitcoins.
Everybody knows that, reaf again
yes and blockchain technology will make lots of worthless bank homos unemployed.
Really?
Specifically In what sector of the bank?
Bump
Brick and mortor banking is slowly becoming obsolete.
Online banking is easier, usually doesn't have fees of any kind, usually has free ATM usage regardless of where you withdrawal from, free debit cards, and usually higher interest rates.
