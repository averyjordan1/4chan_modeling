ITT: We pressure nuls users into admitting they didn't make any money.
nice trips.
I went 10% in at 16 cents, 70% in at 28 and 100% at 32, sold at 95 :)
Lol.
These fools are so obnoxious.
I notice a lot of them were using the op thread to fight some tasty pasta.How about speaking up losers?If you made so much money why don't you donate to your beloved op and post it here.I will literally give everyone in thread 100 XRB if there's a single one of you that made good money and is willing to prove it.
