They're IOUs.
I would suggest NOT buying during FOMO stage and get it cheaper when it drops after a few days/weeks.
It really depends, if big investors see NEO potential, there may be no dips, but if BTC is raping alts, you might get it cheap.
IOUsOnly thing happening now is speculators trading speculation of what the speculation on release will be.
This isn't 10x ico at all.
You're equally as stupid.
Inexplicably stupid.
>a blockchain for blogal enterprise
> uses the bancor formulaAbsolutely not buying your bags shill.
Must have sucked having your tokens locked up while Korean bans ICOs JUSTing you before you could even dump.
It's going to tank hard, sfyl.

JUNE 17, 2017: ANTSHARES RECOMMENDED TO BUY & HOLD BY CRYPTO COINS FOR BEING UNDERVALUED.ANTSHARES(NEO) TRADING AT $3.62 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SJzwTd4JvkSAME YOUTUBER REVIEWED ICON ICX AND GAVE IT 9/10 WITH MASSIVE POTENTIAL IN SEPT 19, 2017:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1cX44hnXTkI made a killing thanks to 4chan, returning a favor to all my pajeet and racist whitepower friends.
This has been a total shit show so far.
ICO website was broken for ages, supposed to hit exchanges at the beginning of October, constant delays, KYC still ongoing.
Also, the other big Korean ICO, BOSCoin, is hitting exchanges about the same time, so any interest in going to be diluted.
Shame, I had such high hopes for this.
haha they already knew about that, watch the vid where he mentions that..
This was b4 the ICO ban came out.
These guys have insiders in the Korean gov.
