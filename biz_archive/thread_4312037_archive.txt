The flippening is not going to happens.It's the most sophisticated PnD of the hystory.They don't give a fuck about Satoshi's vision, scalability, usability etc.They want to make mine the most profitable coin to make more money as possibile.You thought it was a bad news when China banned BTC, they should burn and die.As soon as BCC wouldn't be profitable again they would fork it and start again.Fuck Chink, scummest race.
I have a feeling that the PBoC are helping to fund this show in an effort to undermine all cryptos.
Chinese government is hellbent on controlling its people and decentralised currencies are the last thing they want
