now that the bcc pump is over how come the alts are not recovering?
People aren't quite sure it's over.
Before money returns to shitcoin P and Ds, the bigger boys need to be clear on which hole to stick the majority of their dick into (long term).
4318263because its not over.
this is a cooldown period.
Can't expect it to keep going on like it has been with out cooling off.
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
BCH is going to continue to climb against all logic until it reaches parity.
At which point legacy will freeze.Alts will not recover until the bch trading pairs are added.These are coming soon to binance.
So whatever alts you have there will bounce back.
