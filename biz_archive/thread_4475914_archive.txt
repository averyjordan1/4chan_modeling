What are you gonna do when ISPs slow down or block connections to blockchains?, Cause that can happen if we all don't do something to protect Net Neutrality, hell they might even slow down the connection to this site.

slows downway to fud tardo, you have no idea how blockchain technology works
Then the rest of the world will laugh at the retarded Americans
And when the miners can't make the connections cause the ISP slows the connection?
When consumers can't reach exchanges or when crypto companies get slowed internet cause of vendetta you got a point there but it would have a drastic effect on the crypto market in the USA
I hope Net Neutrality ends.
Slacktavists who think facebook posts and twitter polls can stop the government are delusional.
When you faggots fail maybe you'll wake up.
Only choice is a good ISP that doesn't do that, or a mesh network powered by individuals.
