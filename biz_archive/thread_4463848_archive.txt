>went all in on LRC at 310>panic sold at 252IT'S GOING BACK UP NOW WTF

Why, man?
This thing is on steady uptrend to at least 100-150M marketcap.
The dip was caused by btc surge.
Buy orders are exceedingly active - a big data signal that buyers are excited and the ones competing.
Any close sellers are losers at this point erring on the side of unnecessary risk.
Could be whale manipulation but this coin will 50% this week.
BTC ruined it again.
Buy the dip i guess.
panic soldnever going to stop seeing this shit am i. does anything go through the mind or is it just pure shit dripping on the ankle that triggers these actions?
