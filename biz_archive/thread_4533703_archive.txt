Just wanted to let you know now that I am done accumulatinghttps://github.com/raiden-network/microraiden/milestone/25 days left for mainnet launchbittrex rumorsyou do the math
Raidens actual product won't be out for several months.
You're talking about micro raiden.
this shit already mooned 6x of ico.
I dont touch it , we missed this one as well during linkmania
>release in 5 days>bittrex rumors
it went up in the past therefore it wont go up anymoresometimes I hate this board
>he think biztards will see real opportunity instead of jumping on bch bandwagon
It mooned hard already, it mooned more because of the mainnet launch, it's pretty much coming down now with a high marketcap.
People who bought because of the mainnet already bought in as you saw today it mooned
??
it didnt moon today at all, its closer to its 24hr low than anything elseI swear some of you guys are in middle school
I bought relatively late, at about 40k satsThis dip now will recover pretty fast, we will see before mainnet another peak that will cause a fomo, probably at around 60k sats.
