Astro depth is looking good!
bought a bunch the other day.
literally no reason not to own shares in a hedge fund that pays dividends
getting even more dense.
This is still under the radar, no other exchange and first payouts in december
Definitely one of the best coins on ED right now.
Professional devs too.
Weak pajeet-level shilling.
After the airdrop this is going below $1.00
I don't think it will be that low but it might take a dip.Airdrop to token holders is a good thing long term
I don't think they've announced yet if they are going to do the airdrop.
We should know sometime today.
