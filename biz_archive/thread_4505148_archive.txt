STRAT may be one of the best positioned projects for 2018.
>Master Nodes go live December 11th.
ROI is currently unknown, but should have a good idea after people start reporting.
Sadly, costs 250k STRAT to run a MN.
>Tumblebit is released into the Breeze wallet.
Sure, XMR may be the top right now for privacy, but Breeze w/ Tumblebit will be convenient.>Stratis sidechains and ICOs coming soon.
Sure, by the end of 2017, it'll just be an alpha testnet version, but I expect by 2Q2018, they'll have their first ICO (Blizcash's TVE, I believe).>Identity app will be used for KYC for future ICOs >Smart contracts coming (Alpha version in 2017).>Have signed NDAs with business partnerships; can't be announced just yet.
This is a wildcard, for who knows how large these partnerships can be.
>Price vs. BTC has been crushed, but it's holding against USD.
So, despite dropping the ball pretty hard on releasing products for most of 2017, I think that the hype was warranted for their end products.
Their long, slow, decline has caused Stratis to be mainly ignored.
I think $3.50 right now is an absolute steal.
I've been hodling since $0.63, got some more when it dipped to 4 dollars and plan on maintaining those iron fists for many more months.
costs 250k STRAT to run a MNwat the fuck man
Which is an incentive for whales not to dump, decreasing the supply.
