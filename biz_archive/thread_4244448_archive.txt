It just had a major run, it's refueling - life is not exponential all the time.
Jesus
But my economic losses man!
Think about the losses!
Same here, was also whitelisted.Didnt bother trying bec recent ICOs have failed too, and I thought the low mcap will have little to no bearing.
That's what you get for putting money in coins with no utility.
They are all pump and dump coins, even btc.
Closest to useful of these pow currency only shit coins is montero because money laundering and drug trade.
Its the low marketcap that attracted me to Confido.
Most ICOs are greedy bastards and raise muh money for unrealistic goals and roadmaps.
At least theirs was more realistic.
stupid kid
you were whitelisted and didn't get any CFD?
you're the dumbest fucking person i've ever seen online
Why would you buy VTC anyway?
Remember a year from now you said this.
I've already got 10x gains from this coin and I haven't even been holding that long.
This shit saved my portfolio.
Still crazy undervalued.
You go ahead and stick with your zillion supply erc20 shitcoins though
She...has a penis.
There is pure retardation on 4chan.
Who would have guessed?
OP do you want another chance?
Buy EDO, don't say I didn't warn you
Keep on shilling.I know you want it to drop so you can buy for cheap.
anchovy is bullying me into buying vert
