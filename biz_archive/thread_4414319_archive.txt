None of them have sold any.All of them continue to simply hold or accumulate more.Any of them could cash out right now for millions of dollars.Each of them is obviously committed to what they must clearly see as an undervalued long-term investment.>please shoop pic related to replace the blue cube with the chainlink logo
I'll do it for 100 links
Proof?
this pic is begging for a sergey LINK meme edit.
If I wasn't on a shit PC with paint 3D i'd have a field day.

lol are you trollingthat is the team wallet
How can someone have 350 million link if that's the total circulating supply?
~$72,000 or 450,000 links
How can someone in a ChainLink thread not know that there are a total of one billion tokens, of which:,000,000 were released during the ico and are traded today by us,000,000 are kept by smartcontract.com to be distributed to nodeholders and get the system running,000,000 are simply locked away for the future -- either to be burned in order to reduce the total supply or used in testing or somethingIt's like you don't even lurk, or maybe you troll.
