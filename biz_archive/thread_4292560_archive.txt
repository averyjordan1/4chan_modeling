Bought some bitcoins and etherum for the first time today.So basically just hodl everything no matter how low it drops, buy during low periods, and then sell a little when it gets high.
amirite?
You bought at the worst possibile time, congrats.
kek
shut up cockhead there is no bad time to buyDont sell till 1m OP
You buy when it's high because then it is the most valuable.
You sell if it dips because you don't want to hold an asset depreciating in value.
You get back in when it's high.
Rinse and repeat.
This guy gets it
but isn't buying when low a good way to get a lot of bitcoin that will eventually go up in value again?
Nope, you sell all your ethereum right now and get in on bitcoin and don't do anything with it
Literally tldr of Warren buffet
sell the smallest amount you can to make any profit, even just a penny.
then impress girls with your success at investing in "decentralized cryptocurrencies."
honestly man just come back next year, to be new to crypto at this time is literally just going to put you right off forever.2018 >should><><><> be good tho
eh, i think i`ll just keep buying small amounts during crashes and hodl for about a year
This is a bear trap, first of all.Second, but in real dips.
This is tiny.
"Wow, so you're like a wall-street computer hacker, right?
How much money do you have?
""Pretty much, I don't want to be immodest, but bitcoins are measured in units called 'Satoshis'.
I have several hundred thousand of them.
Right now, a SINGLE bitcoin is worth about $7,000.
"After that comes the pump and dump.
Congratz on buying at the worst time possible, hold it for a year so you can break evenPro tip:Retards like  are the ones who buy high and sell low
