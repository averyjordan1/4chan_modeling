That was it?
Shoe hasn't dropped yet, my friend.https://cash.coin.dance/
Been refreshing shit for three hours now.
I guess I should still be waiting for that one block to be mined.
Dubsit hasn't forked.
1 more blockit will be a gradual process as miners move back to bch
Isn't it priced in?
I don't see BCH going any higher than 0.3.
Splitting my miners between 2 bch pools in a couple hours.
Easy choice.
Done with btc mining for at least a couple months
I would say you should go on a switchable pool (BTC or BCH depending on mining profitability)... however the 100 block spending delay adds a complication...Do you have to wait 100 blocks to get your mining profits or do they reimburse you right away?
