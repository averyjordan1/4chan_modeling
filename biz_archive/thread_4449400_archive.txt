You know, there are a lot of parallels to the philosophical nature of NEO.
He didnt believe at first, then got his shit together and got a little cocky.
n shit went down,and up up up til he met the machines, aka chinese people.
SO, the bags may feel heavy, but its just because neo is sitting on one building and morpheus is on the other and we arent far enough in the movie yet.
