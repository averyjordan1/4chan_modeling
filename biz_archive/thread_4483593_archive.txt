Is it worth to put some money in?
Or will it be a sell-the-news thing?
I really don't know I bought myself @ 8122 so no idea where this is going.Hopefully up.Not saying you should buy nor telling you not to.
I bought last night before the pump, sold for tidy profit this morning, figured the roadmap had already released?
no not yet.
according to:https://twitter.com/GroestlcoinTeam/status/932944345124212736The price is tanking @8000 all the time
GRS will release good news easy 10-20% atleast shortterm, Stop loss 5% under buyin if your a pussy
Nice, guess I'll get back in and relax for a few hours
