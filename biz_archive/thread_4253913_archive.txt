Any recommendations for where to buy them?
Is it possible to buy them direct or do I have to buy BTC and then exchange it?
Not possible to buy them direct yet.
But here are some places:BinanceBitfinexBleutradeYobitI bought on Bleutrade just because that was the only one of those places where I had an account and it's pretty simple to use.
you must be really really dumb or evil
Thanks, I'll have a look at Bleutrade.
How so?
/biz/ has helped me a lot so I'm returning the favor.
I posted this is shill format to be funny.
BTG is the dark horse of the BTC forks.
It's trading for ~$200 and the testnet just began today.
Once it is proven to be workable, which it will, the price should increase another 100% as it has over the last week just in anticipation for the testnet launch.
Don't die
will bittrex ever give out btg?
Yeah they will.
They're just waiting for the mainnet to be launched.
I'm considering selling right before that happen as the price usually will spike up and then crash in a very short amount of time.
Idk we'll just have to wait and see.
