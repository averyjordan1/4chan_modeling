BTC is still going to be the king right?
i'm givig up :(
Who is gonna test him now that 2X is cancelled?
HAIL TO THE KING, BABY!
Nope.
So weak hands.
Have some faith or sell ur coins and apply for mcdonalds
For now.
However, core/blockstream fucked the miners so bad that I wouldn't be too surprised to see BCC overtaking BTC.
For that to happen BTC needs to crash or alternatively BCC needs to pump like fuck.
Eventually Monero will overtake it.
Most normies haven't heard of Monero yet.
Might take a couple years but it will happen
No man, DGB will win long term..
so.. what's the cheapest way to buy alotta btc without getting hit with substantial fees?
Bitcoin segwit will not be king it is a matter of time before the true king takes the throne Bitcoin Cash.
When this does happen and you witness the flippening Bitcoin Cash will will be almost double what bitcoin segwit is now.
Everybody got free bcc people will sell their btc for bcc that’s double the bcc boyz expect the price pump it’s coming
Bitcoin just brushed away consecutive waves of attacks by chink communists as though they were insects and tripled in value at the same time.That should tell you everything you need to know about which coin will be king now and well into the future.
Gook boy, it's time to stop.No one gives a shit about your CCP shitcoin.
in fact, Chinks actively avoid it and buy the real thing.
That should speak volumes.
It's all over red rover
but it can only get so big because no one uses btc for currency.
No mainstream is coming with the way things are and how high transaction fees will be
You mean just like no one uses gold for currency yet it has a marketcap of 7 trillion dollars?Something like that?
