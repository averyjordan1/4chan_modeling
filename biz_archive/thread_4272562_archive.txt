I got 100% gains from MOD, 100% gains on REQ, 200% gains on DCORP, 30% gains on KMD, 30% from NEO, 60% from ARK and finally 100% from EVX from last and this month.
What the fuck is this crypto game I'm playing?
Not larping I know which coin to go for when people shill it.
The regret I have is only throwing $300 at each of them everytime
oh forgot about NULS I sold that at $1 and bought at $0.27 lmao...
Lol same except I try to only throw at 3 at the same time.
from last and this monthbullshit, all alts went down>the coins you listedall shit coins.
Thats makes you 100% a gambler
I just threw $300 at each mate, I didn't care if I lost it, oh but for NEO ARK and KMD I put much more because I knew they was good.
Oh btw I'm not a gambler because I knew they was gonna sky rocket.
>Not larping I know which coin to go for when people shill it.I personally like to say "not larping" when I larp saying I got every moon mission this month, makes me more believable.
yeah though other coins was shilled here and I didn't buy in, I knew EIDOO was good but wasen't interested at the time, XVG was shilled didn't buy, some gaming tokens or coins was shilled did not buy.
ETP and WTC I didn't buy.
I just learned how to quickly grab opportunities on binance bittrex and E. Though I can't be bothered to make an account on Bitfinex
gets easier joining a pump group such as https://discord.gg/7wnGQkt
Good for you OP, i made allot on zen and ETP this month
that's a man
Only pump and dump I participated in was VTC GRC GRS FTC and FCT.
Sad I sold GRS and VTC early though, coulda made much more
