Post itt if you add an extra zero to everything in blockfolio so you aren't embarrassed to check it in public.
Exact opposite, everything is 0.1 what I actually have, so some shoulder surfing normie doesn't think it's like my bank account or something
>caring about what other people think
using blockfolio in a manner in which other people see it
>implying people know wtf im looking at
Anons have been doing this since day one.
Hence why I never used bfolio or cared about such threads.
I downloaded it and saw you could put in whatever you want.
Then I deleted it
no, i remove several zeros so it only looks like i have a few thousand invested
Here's an ideaOnly invest in coins that are dying.
That way you can pull it out and show it off to others so they always think you're getting rekt and dont ask for advice.
Not invest.
I meant create fake entries in coins like link.
i deleted it because you can fake ityou do realize the purpose is to keep track of your holdings for your own sake, right?
