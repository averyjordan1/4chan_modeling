What does it mean
possibly a two-pronged attack where roger takes down corecoin while jihan and the miners pump satoshi's coin
It would mean that core cucks need a new narrative to support the meteoric rise of BCH
You're really reaching now...
he's gonna take down usd holy shit he's replacing usd with btc
LEL he's waiting on the sidelines to see who wins so he doesn't lose anything
4335750 all part of the plan...
FLIPPENING USD FOR BTCAHHHALL IN ON USD NOW!!
!ABANDON SHIP ON THE TITANIC BTCRoger Ver is not the snake in the grasshe's the Ice Berg to that fat-fuck coin known as Bitcoin.The coin that made Ver rich will also now make him...super-rich.so instead of banging 6 japanese geishas, he can now afford 12 each week.
What a goy.
MEGA BCH shill does not buy his so shilled coinmakes your electrons spin
Rodger lost a lot of money yesterday (buying BCH at .5).
If Jihan changes his mind and goes back to mining BTC, Rodger just got royally fucked
Heâ€™s going to dry up the tether
He was going for liteCoin all along.... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Op.
How do you know that is very?
It's likely some unrelated whale getting out of crypto altogether until things calm down.
There are many big fish on bitfinex.
The transactions to exchanges happened long after that peak though.
So no.
lol, exactly what I was thinking
See if his wallet matches the transactions
