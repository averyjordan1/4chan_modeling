My GF has informed me that her brother who is a minor quit his job and is now performing some scheme to make money.
He won't tell her all the details but she summarized it as he is taking orders for bulk product and selling it for free with expensive shipping, then buying the product to fill the order.
We're both confused as to how he now has $1600 and I'm afraid he's going to get himself in trouble.
Does anyone here have an idea what he might be doing?
Would the bulk product be kneepads by any chance?
Mind your business faggot
My guess is he is doing drop shipping and you misunderstood him a bit.
cocaine flow mane
tfw you will never fugg that anime grill from that animeit hurts to live
Alot of people used to do this, you see all these 0$ computer mice with 15$ shipping cost, these mice cost less then 2$ to buy.
Sounds like scummy dropshipping.
Not unheard of, pretty sure it's legal enough.Good on him for being a chad, at least he's doing more in life than OP.
instead of being a wagekek he decided to take matters into his own hands desu.
now mind your business!!!
Yeah I'm also gonna say sounds like he may be dropshipping
OP is a faggot
He's selling photos of your GF.
really really good photos......
$1600 isn't a lot of money but its a start.
Good on him for taking control of his life and finances and starting a business.
Mind your your business OP.
Can confirm.
I got one and let's just say NoFapNovember ended a bit prematurely this year.
