"In October 2017, Metaverse was the only Chinese Blockchain company represented at the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, which gathered major industry players in the payments and financial industry.
She told the audience that multinational companies such as IBM and MasterCard started business discussions with Metaverse and were eager to learn more about the Blockchain industry and its implications.

Woah, Money 20/20?!
I'm sold!
Tell me more!
Some heavy shilling of etp today.
I suspect this has been chosen by a pump and dump group.
Beware.
Partnership with Draper Dragon https://medium.com/@mvs_org/special-investment-fund-of-5-million-etp-established-to-boost-metaverse-ecosystem-development-a4bdf8b6c010>https://medium.com/@mvs_org/metaverse-to-attend-the-8th-caixin-summit-6667530bffd5>https://twitter.com/mvs_org/status/932500246361288704>https://twitter.com/ChandlerGuo>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T_AkeeoLNU>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGAnZMZr43wLook into all of this.
I don't think IBM is "eager to learn more about the Blockchain industry", they are actively involved and leading the business end of it lololol.
SO they are actively involved with bloackchain and want to talk to metaverse, even more bullish anon you ain't getting cheaper etp
