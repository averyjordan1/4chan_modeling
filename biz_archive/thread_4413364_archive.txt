pick any exchange, get bitcoin, ethereum and monero and hold it until you read more about the market
reddit.com/r/cryptocurrencyCoinbase is the easiest for now
KekFuck off leddittor
Go fuck yourself underage fag.
LTC too its stable as fuck
this unironicallyno point hodling Bitcoin or any of the top 10 right now since the market caps are insanely high
Just Bitcoin.
Hold for 10 years, don't look at the price, and you'll be fine.
However, I would put like $10k in.If you want to gamble, you can also buy other cryptos but like 99.9% are literally shit.
buy high, sell low
research a lot before u put money in, even BTC is getting a little scary now with BCH and B2X trying to take over.
BTC could go to 10k near end of year or people cash out for holidays OR people put their money on BCH everything can happen
suck my dick you fat jew
what does this gesture being performed by the emoji signify?
Even if it went 10k by the end of the year, that's only 25% gains.
Is it actually worth it to even go in at this point?
Risk seems to offset the potential gains pretty badly now.
Personally I'm waiting for the next big dip.
