Quietly moons.
What's the point to owning the actual token for This?It's literally just a """""membership""""" on the platform.
No dividends, no interest revenue, you're just a flipper for demand on the platform.Hey that's great and all, but if we're running a service I'd like my coins to generate revenue.
Fuck this coin
don't buy it if you don't even understand how it works.
Not really.
Sold at 4 dollars to buy BCH at 750.Now it's 3.62.
It won't moon until after the drama is over and even then, this flippening makes people and hopefully salt question how big a safety margin the collateral should have.
Well my understanding is there's no interest revenue from holding membership tokensThat being the case you can take you 5x I don't care, I'd rather focus on dividendcoins
I don't care, I'd rather focus on dividendcoins% dividends per annum>price fluctuates 10% per day>easier for whales to manipulate using their dividends>if it goes down more than 30%, it literally does not matter whether there are dividendsspoken like a true normie
Do you know what dividends are?
They mentioned you will be able to stake your tokens in the future.
No other details though.
