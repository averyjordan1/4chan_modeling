Just bought a lot of DCORP, AMA
Where did you buy it?
Is it too late?
If not when will it be too late?
already pumped no one buy, everyone is currently on EPY
I'm tired of this fucking question.
Just look on coinmarketcap and if a coin isn't on coinmarketcap it's on etherdelta
Cryptopia has it, I doubt you'll be too late.
Are you the pajeet who replies to his own posts?
