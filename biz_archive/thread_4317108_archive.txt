Is there a way to find previous ShapeShift.io transaction/conversion information?
Basically just going through some conversions I did and making records because I was a retard and didn't make any records earlier.
Can I find it If I have the to and from addresses?

Show me how to get a ShapeShift.io bookmark page then with information about the transaction
