Whats the next bitcoin?
I dont mean another coin/alt but tech that will hugely disrupt
sex dolls
Adult diapers.
No really.
Unironically?
I'd go for Monero desu
yesi dont mean doll as in inanimate, but ones with AI and personalitiesits going to be the next big thingsex robots and general companion ai is next
Mother fucker im not talking about crypto.
I mean the next big thing
unless BCH takes over
FPBP.
God damn, I came here just to post this.
probably the facebook coin.FBCash
BTX
Why do you believe there will be a 'next big thing'?Most of the tech that disrupted our world goes back at least half a century.
If you think about it, most of the tech of today is just the natural development of what was created during the 60s:>the first message sent through the internet was in 1969>the most popular operating system, UNIX was created in 1969-1971>the programming language C (arguably the most popular one and the one most modern languages derive from) was created in 1969-1971>computers/microprocessors went down in size during the 1960s, 1970sThen there are a couple of milestones:>the web, 1991>amazon, 1996>google, 1998>facebook, 2004>the release of the Iphone, 2007>bitcoin, 2009Everything you're seeing now is less and less profound as a technological change.
Bitcoin is indeed a huge breakthrough, but I believe is the only truly relevant one we've seen in the last 10 years.
Let me fix that for you friend:>the web, 1991>amazon, 1996>google, 1998>facebook, 2004>the release of the Iphone, 2007>bitcoin, 2009>monero, 2014
the web, 1991>amazon, 1996>google, 1998>facebook, 2004>the release of the Iphone, 2007>bitcoin, 2009>monero, 2014>chainlink, 2017
the web, 1991>amazon, 1996>google, 1998>facebook, 2004>the release of the Iphone, 2007>bitcoin, 2009>monero, 2014>chainlink, 2017>sex dolls 2018>space travel 2020
space travelMore like 1969 brah.
Even reaching the moon is out of our capacities now.
Forget about seeing anything like that ever again in your lifetime.Also why sex dolls when you can fuck lots of 19 year-old tumblr part-time escort student that are cheap and just do it for fun?
This is the real future.

the most popular operating system, UNIXDon't you love when people use bullshit like this to make you think they're smart, but it's not even accurate.
Windows 7 is the most popular OS for desktops and laptops and Android is the most popular mobile OS.
But this is exactly what you wanted, someone to tell you you're wrong so you can start shouting "UNIX=LINUX and UNIX=MACOS LOL YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?!?!?!"
and that's not even true depending on how you're defining UNIX.
I remember kids in elementary school used to love doing this as soon as they learned a new thing.
The "dihydrogen monoxide" bit was a very popular one.
That's the league you're in.
You're just like a 12 year old who just had his first chemistry lesson and is now trying to trick everyone so people think he's smart.>computers/microprocessors went down in size during the 1960s, 1970sThis happened in the 40's, 50's, 80's, 90's, 00's, 10's as well.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
BECAUSE I DID SO I'M SMARTER THAN YOU HEY EVERYBODY LOOK AT ME.
Are you clinically retarded or just high?You understood what I meant with UNIX.
It defined the foundations for pretty much every modern OS.
Sure, you might argue that Windows 7 and Android are the most popular nowadays, buy they are not 'breakthroughs' in a technological sense, just a natural evolution of already existing concepts and implementations.And yes, the shrinking of microprocessors continues to this day, but we're reaching a plateau nowadays.
What I meant is that, most likely, the most significant changes belong to that era.
Monero and Filecoin

Desktop systems and smartphones that retard uses are not relevant here at all.
Unix is the dominant platform on servers, microcontrollers and on your fucking toaster.
Fusion.But the little guy wont be able to buy in from the very start.
I remember my great great great grandpappy used to make the same argument about horseshoes and kerosene lamps.
And we haven't made any progress since then!
D printing maybe.
cure for autism
The rate of innovation has been declining since the 19th century.
Of course we're making progress (duh), but not as quickly and drastically.
And this is not some fringe argument, but generally agreed on.
This, maybe>Anything that generates effectively free power/energy.>Perhaps machines that synthesise free nutritious food from cheap raw elements>Any breakthrough in battery technology that increased energy density by 10 or 100 times(free power + 100x battery density = floating cities, flying cars everywhere)
Something that people currently see as dumb
Agreed, something like Decentraland MANA
quantum computingartificial wombsgenetic modification (human)fusion reactorslife extension tech (live to 300)decentralized mesh networks
How do I invest in this?
This is wrong.
Decentralized server nodes for an encrypted messenger aka ODN lol..Money Skelly Da CP supporter would use it... dark web would use it.
How can you shut down something that’s decentralized...you can’t.
..
No, something that neets like me can invest in so we can be rich, drive Lambos and fuck artificial blonde sex robots with feminine penises.
Google: Decentraland (MANA)
artificial wombs where you grow genetically engineered pokemon that you can fuck>ICO in 2019>coming to market 2021
are you retarded?
Also why sex dolls when you can fuck lots of 19 year-old tumblr part-time escort student that are cheap and just do it for fun?I'm an introvert autist and business wise sex dolls are a good investment (see fleshlights and the like).
Arteficial wombsStill have to raise the kids.Sadly wont really change the shitskin problem
x might be possible, 100x energy density in batteries is "impossible" (probably not truly impossible, but it would require breakthroughs in a bunch of different fields all at once, so it's definitely many decades away at best)
Yea women are are the new vaporware.
Some decent futuristic ideas but the big one everyone is missing is brain machine interfacing.Eventually we will all have our minds connected to the internet, eventually melded into one super brain and live forever in a digital world.
No more need for physical inventions, we will all literally be digital
Good luck investing in that idea right now.

Good luck not getting absorbed into the supercollective and becoming slavefag
BTG.
I already went full in it with x100 lev.
XMR
rare pepes
COSS
Decentralized oracles.
