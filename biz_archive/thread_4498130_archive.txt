hey fellasWant to know your opinion on Dragonchain.
This is a blockchain platform that was used by Disney internally and then released for a public ICO which raised 16 million USD.
Currently it is being audited and tokens are expected to be released in about 2 weeks.
As for me, it has all signs of a successful ICO.
Prove me wrong.
I was in their telegram from the start and was excited for this but I ended up taking a hard pass.
Mediocre coin at best
THis pajeetcoin is poopoopeepee
Using dragonchain to raise money for other projects, Dec-Feb.... Where is the value in that?
(Nope)Feb onwards when it actually releases it's mainnet i'll buy in.
I like the business blockchain model.
but right now i dont think it's a good value, better off putting your money elsewhere.
I ended up taking a hard passWhy?
I am also in their Telegram and it feels confident.
vitalik and friends invested $1mill in this shitcoin.
they must of seen some rainbows.
why not bump this thread
and again
