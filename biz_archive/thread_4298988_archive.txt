>captcha "roads"The great unJUSTening is upon us.
Legit?
Yes.
That is why there are so many threads.
For once we found something that wasn't "Priced in.
"Based whale anon was based.
Proof?
I got a decent bag of NULS but I've yet to see anything beyond rumours.
Holding just over 1250 NULS.
Wish I had more to put into it.
Watching Kyber like a hawk since I have 1000 of those on Binance that I'm thinking of dropping into it if it starts either start going down significantly.Pic related was my stack just as it paired with BTC.
Nice.
I drunkenly FOMOd in to the tune of 5552 the other night.
Even if the rumours of it being regulation compliant/gov approved turn out to be bullshit I'd still expect it to eventually increase enough to make decent gains.
Of course if rumours are true then we've both basically made it.
I have a good feeling about this one.
I got in on ANS ~3.50 and OMG below $1, but I sold OMG way too early.
Missed WTC entirely.
But this time around I'm buckling down and doing it right.
Like I said, I'm close to dropping 1000 Kybers worth onto this too if it looks like we're about to breakout.
So I should have ~3000 then.
The thought of this blowing out and actually pulling a NEO on us though?

Haha yeah, I don't have any big Lambo dreams so it reaching current NEO levels would be enough for me to retire happy.Also sitting comfy with a stack of Arab coins and DEX bags which I'm very optimistic on.
