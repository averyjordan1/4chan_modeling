I'm not gonna buy at an ath and lose 20% immediately.
I'll catch the next pump.
Last week I bought 3K of BTC so I could trade it all into BCH.
Got it onto Bittrex and by then BCH had already began pumping so I thought I'd wait it out.
Traded my BTC back for fiat the next day....made $4 :)
Slow and steady.
