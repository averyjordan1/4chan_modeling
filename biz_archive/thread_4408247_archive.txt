Reminder that 8k, 9k, and 10k are just arbitrary numbers.It's inevitable that this will go parabolic beyond what you consider a possibility.
I tell myself when $10k is broken we go down a level of fomo we never thought possible
who cares?
if you think i will ever fomo, when i'm holding alts that will actually be used as currency in the future, you're mistaken.
bitcoin is a mess... it will never be used because it cannot scale.
the only reason the price is going up, is because of manipulation, chinese miners and fake tether money pumps.
but hey, keep buying high.
later you will fomo because of the alts that you could've bought cheap.
i gonna full crypto, to win or die, but i lost 500 this week, i guess i am in the loose side, but wtf i prefer to be someday rich instead a poor fagot commie
this is you
my usd value only goes up, no matter what happens to bitcoin.
CME group will offer futures by December, people can short BTC, it will never reach 10k
you still don't understand why USDT exists, do you?
Because I've been reading a lot about it over here and how it is construed a scam
Ahem,allow me to pontificate a bit for your edification.those shorts you're talking about and the CME futures WILL NO WAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF BTCCCCCCCCCCCCCbecause1.)
THEY ARE CONTRACTS THAT WILL BE SETTLED IN CASHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHthe only security that will affect the value of BTC are ETFs or exchange traded funds.
and if you could short those then yes they will help stabilize the value of BTC BUT CME FUTURES WILL NOT AFFECT THE SPOT PRICE OF BTC
they will still use it to pump the price up and dump on the loser who will buy at the top.
nobody reads what stuff actually means.
bitcoin is the most manipulated crypto.
the chinese miners and exchanges care only about pumping and dumping it.
it will never have real qorld application other than serving to take money from dump people and give it to the miners and whales.
it's 100% centralized.
a few chinese miners can literally decide to stop mining tomorrow and freeze every transaction.
lol>currency of the future
