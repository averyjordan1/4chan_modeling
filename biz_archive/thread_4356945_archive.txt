what the fuck is wrong with most wagecucks?
they constantly whinge about their shit job, spend all of their money on alcohol and useless junk whilst complaining about being in a shit financial situation.
they are content with being abused by mr shekelstein everyday but laugh when people go out on a limb and create a business only for it to fail later.
why are they are so attracted to risk adverse shit?
why do they get off over the failures of others?
can someone please explain to me why they have this fucking awful mentality?
They can't succeed so they are jealous of success of others, and take happines from failure of others because it tells them their way is not so shitty.
Simple.
