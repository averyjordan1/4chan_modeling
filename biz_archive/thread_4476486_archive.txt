Will we see a record pink wojack day on /biz sooner than later?
serious questionwhy would anyone hold tether?
probly not many here actually holding it, most are worried that when tether collapses, it will take the entire crypto market with it
Looks like 30 million tether was created maliciously, whether internally or they were hacked.
It lines up with the last transparency report on their website.
