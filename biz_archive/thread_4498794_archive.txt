Science blockchain has several qualities that I believe will make it a high achieving token.-run by actual VC's with experiencing exiting profitable companies-low marketcap-you hold Science tokens, you get free tokens from every ICO they help run (they are an incubator, they find companies or people with ideas and get them to do a startup and do an ICO).-they are legititimate at a time when it's hard as hel to parse through the glut of ICO bullshit.
I definitely see less /biz posts about upcoming ICO's these days and more about existing ones.
Anyways 11 hours left to invest.
This is an under the radar one.
Also you need to be non-US.

Dcorp and what is the waves one?
OK I just looked up dcorp but that sounds completely different, it's like a DAO, the VC's are running things at science.
