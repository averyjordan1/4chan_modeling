i cant take this anymore.
i can only hope that /biz/ finds a similar low cap ico that will unJUST me in the future
You do realize ICOs are dead right????
They have been for months.
Unless you sell the second it hits the exchange you'll have eternal bags of lead.
same here bro, I got justed so fucking hard this month.
but I bought confido on ED anyway, I'm confident it still had room for growth.
