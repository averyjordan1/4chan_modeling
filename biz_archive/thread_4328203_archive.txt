Post at 30 july 2017:https://pastebin.com/n0aGBMQrSo far all predictions are right.
Also where did the hashpower go?
Has it vanished?
BCH / BTC both at 7 blocks/hour... will they all go mine BCH at tomorrows hard fork?
yes, hash jumped over just enough to be agonizingly slow and but still process blocks so people can dump.
Spectacular coup, professionally done.
