Just to clarify, it's not on January 1.
It's by January 1.
Their priority was to first list B2X which isn't happening anymore then BCH.
I'd say coinbase will list BCH by the end of November or early December.
Not to shill BCH anymore but the listing on coinbase will legitimize and create major recognition for BCH, like it has for all the coins that they support.
https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdfWe are planning to have support for bitcoin cash by January 1, 2018, assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2892196-bitcoin-gold-faqCoinbase's current priority is to add support for Segwit2x, followed by Bitcoin Cash.
We will continue to monitor the development of Bitcoin Gold, and if its network proves to be both secure and valuable, Coinbase may decide to support it at a later date.
listing for withdrawals doesn't mean for trading.they'll delay this for as long as possible.
That will mostly allow new bch holders to dump it.
Obviously that no they will add trading support.
Maybe at first, likes any other coin.
People that but ETH @ $10 probably sold at $20 but more buyers came in and bought @ $20.
That's how the game works.
I gotta imagine them and bitpay are waiting for the daa fork to work before they add it
There's one miner alone who holds 50,000 BCH.
That's just one of them.
Then there's the people hodling BCH from the fork that never sold it.
When and if Coinbase allows people to sell BCH straight to fiat BCH will fucking PLUMMET.
why would you dump BCH if its going to be worth 10's of thousands
