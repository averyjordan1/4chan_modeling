>does nothing wrong>gets raped harder than BTCcan we have a moment of prayer for the little guy?
ETH $450 by tomorrow
BTC did nothing wrong either.
This is tether's fault.
It also had a pretty substantial quiet moon while BTC has hovered around 8k for a bit
yeah but you fucks rode the wave of fake tethers with no guilt.
You are just as responsible for all of this.
I hope you die

ETH has been pumped with Tether too.
Everything on Bitfinex has.
Its that shill from the other eth fud thread.
Why are you so butthurt just let "scammers" get scammed investing into eth.

I didn't want to, I just wanted to invest in cool shit :(
It was 3 hunnid like yesterday bro
easy, newfriend.
do you really want to compare eth to bitcoin hacking reports?also, eth wasn't hacked.
