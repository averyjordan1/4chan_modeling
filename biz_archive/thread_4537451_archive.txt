My girlfriend got a tax refund and she wants me to invest it in crypto since I always bang on about it.How fast do you think she will dump me if I put her all in on LINK?
You will be rich anon.
If things don't pan out with her, just tell her you "lost" it all.
LINK is going to moon to the moon next year, yadadadamean?
Vertcoin might be a better short term hold for the December halving though.
kek, let her read the whitepaper and tell her about the oracle problem first then tell her about sibosmake another person a linkie anon do it, its like going to hell but worse
Don't do it anon.
You'll condemn her to months and possibly years of posting rambling link threads on /biz/ about "muh lambos" and pretending link is going to overtake Bitcoin in market cap.
fortune favors the bold
I already have 20,000 LINK myself.Tempted to put her all in rather than diversify for lelz.I could get her some low risk gains parking her in ETH or something but I want her to share my linkie pain.
Just get more LINK man.
I only got 12k LINK, but I have a emergency fund in my bank account, and I might just go all in with that as well.
This is like Antshares for pennies all over again.
Just put it into the Crypto20 ICO which is much safer.
They just tie the top 20 coins to a token that way she gets exposure to crypto without doing much at all and ride with the crypto growth.
