I was informed.Lost 12k â‚¬ on it.Bagholder of alts for too long.
Let me just go in BTC.Now BTC bagholder.Bad luck.

btc bagholder
Now that big boys are trading btc they do the same shit than forex.Some new that should push price down ?
Many people will short.
What they do is pump like crazy so the short get margin called, which means the short have to buy back, pushing the price even higher, and then they dump.If you want to daytrade btc now you need to know about high volume speculative markets with huge leverage or you won't make it.
lost 10k on this shit
This guy gets it.
Don't even try to time the market at this point.
Actually feels like I got fucked literally.
Cant even be mad yet.
