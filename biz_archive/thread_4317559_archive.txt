>just bought 25 euros worth of BTC>to get it to my wallet it costs 9.77 EURFor you euro-illiterate americunts that is over 10 dollars of transfer costs.What the fuck...?!
I mean what the actual fuck.
What exchange are you using?
Coinbase.
I use it to buy BTC in small doses but apparently it's not worth it any more.If you buy BTC for $20 it costs half of that to transfer it to your personal wallet.
I fucked around on a faucet for a few hours and made $10 worth of BTC.
It cost me $9.80 to transfer to my wallet.
This is why Bitcoin Cash exists.
$0.1 transaction fees.
Stop using the disgusting Jewcoin for small quantities.
Use regular Banks to deposit on Coinbase, zero fees.
Then use GDAX to buy on limit, zero fees.
Then you can deposit the bitcoins anywhere you want.
I really don't know how people still are this stupid.
If this was a bait, Nice job.
Just buy Ether or LTC, transfer fees are less than 0.20 euros
You, a crypto-illiterate eurocunt (jk, you larping faggot) could have bought Litecoin or Ethereum and transferred to a swapping wallet like Jaxx.Fuck you, though.
There's no truth in you.
OH, GEE WILLIKERS, SOME DICK POPS UP TO HELPFULLY SHILLFuck your pajeet thread, goddamn whores

Cry more blockstream kikeMy ManCan we expect a flippening
To be clear, you've just represented yourself as a man with shit-stained pants, though you don't seem to realize it.Well, have a nice day
it's representing you you retard lmaogo back to plebbit if you cant get the culture
yes most definately
Great timing you got there.
One week earlier or later and you would have paid ~2â‚¬.Also maybe buy less often and bigger amounts.
Tx prices are not related to how much money you send
Wait a few days ,tx prices are high right now due to chinks attacking the network
This is a stupidity fee for not doing some research where the fees might be lower.
What a thread.
Everyone shits on each other and the only helpful reply is someone shilling.
Should have bought ETH, sent it to Binance or some other exchange and then buy BTC with 0.10% fees dude.It's like you want to lose money.
blocks mined during it's heyday.
In the meanwhile, BTC has 140000 awaiting blocks.
BCH is dead and that's why it's cheap.
Miners feel scammed and will turn their backs on it soon.
Sign up to GDAX and deposit to there, then exchange it for something useful or just withdraw for cheaper.
what is ETH
bitcoinhahahaha why would you spend money on that legacy shitcoin HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA 10 dollar fees and 4 week send times good god hahahahahahahhahahahahhaha
digital gold
