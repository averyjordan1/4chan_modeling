"Bitcoin is used for illegal drugs" well so is the USD and nobody talks about stopping the use of it... Just because a few people use it for bad stuff doesn't mean it itself is bad.

This is what's called "preaching to the choir" anon.
yes but the usd is also used for other things like buying groceries and clothes.no one shops with btc.
its primarily a store of value, and secondarily a medium of exchange for illicit transactions.usd is both a medium of exchange and a store of value
