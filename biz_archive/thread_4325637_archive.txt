Do you see the anti/hate memes against any other coins like REQ, NEO or KNC?No , and you know why?
Because people don't see them as a threat.
LINK On the other hand is a huge threat to people and they are super jealous of the upcoming moon mission, so instead of arguing against it the just make silly memes to hide their frustration
Yeah the double standard against LINK is amazing.
HAHAHHA guy is fatBest argument when the team actually is working, getting on conferences, solve a problem all blockchains will need instead of posting fucking skateboards and mcdonalds pictures...
