/biz/ always talks about missing moon missions and getting justed but this is literally the most obvious moon mission within the next week you're an idiot if you don't buy some at it's ATL.
Stable price, so low risk of going broke.
If the rumors are true one could do decently on this one.
Do your own research fuckers
Could be a huge partner release very soon, the trend is reversing as well and it's at its ATL.
I know it's a meme, but you literally hate money if you don't get on this.
dont tell me to do my own research fag, theres a reason why im in 4chan
So I've got this bridge in Brooklyn, I'll give you a great price
Its not the partnership you should be hype for.
The project and the team itself are amazing.
These guys will be the first cloud computing project on blockchain to take off and be adopted.
I fully believe in this coin and have about $1k worth (which is a big chunk of my portfolio, I'm new and poor), but why this week?
Seems to me like it could take weeks or months to get the market cap it deserves
Supposedly a "cool announcement" is coming.I'm speculating IBM.IBM + blockchain cloud computing can only mean crazy things for the future.
