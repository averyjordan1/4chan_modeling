Plz b r34l
I've been trading since 2013, I did 1 positive trade out of ~200, or 2 if you count the fact that I bought btc at 400$ and never sold.It has always been medium/long term on coins with really good fundamentals, no panic sell/buy or anything, just the market fucking me over and over.I held monero for 6 months and sold at a loss at 50 cents, I made coins that had days or week long uptrends reverse the minute I bought and never recover.
Jesus fucking Christ anon.
Rodger or Jihan will end up dead soon.
They've fucked so many people like you playing their stupid financial games.
I'm sorry for your loss OP
