have 0.1 btc worth of VTC, and that's it.What's the quickest way to 1 BTC?
Hold til halvening, put into RCN, REQ and LINK unless they've already mooned.
Buy 1 BCH, wait until it takes over.
This is the best advice though anon, I'm doing it myself.
Keep buying until you have 10k LINK and 2.5-5k REQ, 2.5-5k RCN.THIS IS THE IRON PILL BAG SET, LIMITED EDITION.
IGNORE ALL OTHER MOON TRIPS UNTIL YOU'VE MADE IT.
