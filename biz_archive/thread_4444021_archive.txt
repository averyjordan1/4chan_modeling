Daily reminder that COSS is literally the best investment.
LMAO why is there are two "BUY COSS" panelPeoples will buy 2* as much ?

Those charts are basically unreadable WTF who thought transparent boxes on black was a good idea
owning coss gets you more coss because of people buying coss on the coss exchange>brilliant
daily reminder to buy nuls
Wait For It!
Coss is the most undervalued opportunity in crypto right now.
The only reason I think it isn't getting tons of attention is that you must hold it for more than 24 hours to benefit unlike all these other shitcoins that people push here.Only more mature and patient investors hold Coss as they understand what it represents opportunity wise.
FYI, you own a f'en piece of an exchange.
What would the same thing be worth if it was bittrex or poloniex or any other....
POSW 2.0 Don't buy this literal shitcoin
Well, if Coss had the volume of Bittrex, each token would give 7c in dividends per week.So, if you owned 10k COSS (calculated bc that's what I have), you would be getting about $34k in dividends per year.
Not taking into account growth of earnt tokens, exclusive airdrops, and natural coss accumulation by dividends.I know getting to Bittrex level is a massive, massive task...
But the potential is mouth-watering.
Feels like this has been shilled for 1 year already, and it's been only about 2 months, give it a rest, take your losses.
That is what I am talking about!
I am glad someone else has done the math too :)Remember, Coss is going to be adding FIAT-ALT purchase opportunity very and this will attract all sorts of buyers that are not wanting to buy bitcoin and pay fees to just turn around and trade bitcoin for the alt they really want.
this is a one in a lifetime opportunity people.
(lol i must sound like i am a salesman for Coss but I just get all giddy and happy when I think about Coss)
