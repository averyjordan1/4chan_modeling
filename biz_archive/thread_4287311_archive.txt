There have been many times when I have needed to stay awake because the markets are acting crazy and things are still mooning but will eventually dump.
Do any of you take amphetamines, ie, modafinil, to stay awake during these times?
How does it work out for you?
I am no stranger to stimulants, but I have never taken them whilst extremely tired.
Wondering if it would boost cognitive function, or just keep you awake but still unable to think clearly due to sleep deprivation?

Modafinil is not an amphetamine.
