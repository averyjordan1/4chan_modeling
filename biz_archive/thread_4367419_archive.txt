Keep hearing about this.
All my shit's in BTC though and I don't wanna wait two days to transfer in and then two days to cash out.I'm short on cash but do you think it would make sense to put in like $150 (into ETH from some exchange, transfer to binance, then buy BCPT)?
Or is this more of a risky play, good if you have spare gambling assets but not as really good for trying to take off on?
Keep in mind that I'm a poorfag
