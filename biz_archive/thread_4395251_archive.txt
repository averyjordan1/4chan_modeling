With the many blockchain projects seemingly coming out from every corner, it’s hard, to keep track of all of them, and know which are legitimate.
After much lurking on Reddit, Bitcointalk, and other crypto spaces I came across VeChain and after doing some research, I have found a few interesting mentions of their partnerships, one however, I think is massive and a total game changer.VeChain have signed a partnership, poetically called “the Unicom cloud ecological strategic cooperation agreement" with China Unicom the world’s third largest telecommunications company by subscription (Revenue: 274.2 billion CNY (2016)).
They cover hundreds of millions of users with a huge business network and ecosystem.
Vechain’s role in the partnership will be to develop and help the state owned enterprise within its business network with BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) on the cloud using blockchain.Essentially, China Unicom and VeChain will develop a product, that provides BaaS to help China Unicom improve the efficiency of its supply chain management.
As with the nature of business in China, China Unicom is part state owned which might provide Vechain with a‘ foot in the door’ for future government partnerships with the likes of China Telecom (revenue 352 billion and China Mobile (World's largest Mobile provider by subscribers - 873 million and revenue of 388 billion CNY).It’s crazy for a company not to shout loudly about the huge significance of this partnership, especially one that deals with a large scale government owned ISP, government mechanisms, and for VeChain being the first and only blockchain technology partner!
(people at VeChain if you read this lets slide into DMs).
