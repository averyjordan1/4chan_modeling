Everyone knows verge is a pure pump and dump scheme.
They always pump their coin and then blame marketing guys on the failure and then they pretend to fire someone.
Then they repeat their countdown and say that it is coming soon and then it fails to deliver.
Then they repeat the cycle again.
There are huge sell walls that will never be overcome.
Anon - if you own this and do not get out quick you will loose your money.
Nice, I sold 100,000 at a profit when I saw your post.
(Also, I got sick and tired of the dev not releasing shit on time.)
Nice just just'd 100k
Read their twitter threads and you can see the holes in their story.
It just does not add up.
I know when I smell shit and XVG is steaming right now....
HOWS IT FEEL FAG knowing that all you gotta do is buy in set ur price and chill.I bought in at 86 and still holding for 2 weeks dont worry i'll hit my double up price point by next week imagine that even right now i'm up ohhh look at that 2g's up on that one i'll wait and cash out my 10g's in a week
100+ bitcoins ready to dump within 10 sats of current price.
Constant down pressure.
The buy walls go away real fast when the slightest of selling occurs.
It is all smoke and mirrors people.....
I would dump at a loss to get out of this shit coin
What annoys me is you can't have a monero thread without 3 or 4 verge shills spamming it with their NOTICE ME SENPAI bullshit
Pump and Dump crew about to all drop XVG today.
I would get out asap....
