>sell my Bitcoin Gold on bittrex for 400 dollars>it pumps to 550 dollars less than 90 seconds laterYour welcome guys
sold at 300$, seen it reach 600$ a few seconds later
It's back down to $150, so you done gud, anon
we've all been there, just don't FOMO back in
Same.
But free money.
I'm not upset.
Fuck this Bitcoin gold shit.
this, be happy and remember you could easily lose it all if you fomo, especially now while it's extremely volatile
it's ok to laughbought back to sell at current price (0.06)but then I checked the USD value on bitfinex (160usd) and realized I would get REKT, so I soldthe definition of stupidity
nah man it just hit the 700$ mark!
buy now or you'll regret it
Nah it's around 600 on bittrex right now but the price is jumping all over the placeOf course not
I didn't even bother getting mine.
Same for Bcrash.
Too lazy.
I just dumped it, don't even know what price.
.061 I think.
Hope this doesn't bite me in the ass like dumping my BCH did but the general consensus seems to be that BCG is a shitcoin.
Of course, that was the consensus around BCH once upon a time.
Also FUCK BITTREX with that 100k sat fee to withdraw.
No way I'd leave any funds there and they always jew me on the withdrawal.
I got lucky at 0.069 but whatever dude.
You still sold it at 2.5 times market value.
You can't time these anomalies.
Easiest $1300 I've ever madeThanks retards
why is no one laughing at my stupid trades :(I made less than 50bucks when I could have made 100
Why is this fucking scam shitcoin pumping?
Because even the worst BTC forks are better than the best altcoins, because.... normies.
Fuck I have so many coin inputs.I need to send all of my coins into a new wallet, then use this wallet.dat in the bitcoin gold core softwareI cant move all of them at once or would break my anonimitytoo lazy
