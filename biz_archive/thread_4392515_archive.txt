>buy high sell lowThis is so fucking true for alts, in the alt/BTC ratio, that it hurts, even when I make a little profit of alts, is nothing compared to the profits I would have made if I kept it all on BTC from the start, there was no advantage to diversifying the portfolio.This crypto game is truly unforgiving, will alts truly have their day in the sun?
Linker here.
alts are much riskier than the king, usually.
that's the name of the game.I've 3x'd on alts before.
it does happen.
most recently NULs.
sell high before a dump>oh shit its going back up agian reeee>buy back in a little higher than when you sold>dump>starts pumping again>repeat
I just don't want to bleed money, or see muh bitcoins dropping and regret changing to alts.I mean, if I didn't read and research anything, all my money would be on bitcoin and I would have made some sweet profits.Goddamn Vitalik, stop being autistic and just release Casper already.
there's still a shitload of money to be made from alts, even in this rape market, but i feel you.
i keep thinking, that 100 billion plus market cap on BTC can't just increase that fast, but then like 20 billion flow in, in a matter of a couple of days...meanwhile an alt with a measly 40 mil market cap and "solid fundamentals" can't even do a fucking 2x these days.
that's why i completely ignore those cashgrab icos with a humongous hardcap.
look at REQ for example, they don't have fucking anything to show for it, but the coin starts with like a 30 mil marketcap, that really lowers the moon potential a LOT.
