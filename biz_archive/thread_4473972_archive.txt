So most delegates have a minimum payout, right?
let's say I voted for Arkpool... now their minimum payout is 4 ark...
I only have 30 ark total.
so will it'll take me 2 years to earn the payout reward?
Am I missing something?Please help... how can I earn with my ark.
Do I need more ark, or find a delegate that pays poor fags like me?
I only have 30 ark totalYou don't have enough to do anything.
well fuck dude how much ark do i need...and should i set the payout monthly to save on fees.
lets say i get my stack up to 100 ark.
i can get shit done then right?
There's a 1 ark fee to vote so you're really better off just not touching it because even if there was no minimum payout requirement it would still take you 4-6 months just to make back the voting fee
so how much ark do i need guys......
After fees and everything, with only 30 Ark you would get 2-3 Ark a year.Don't even bother
a bunch of the delegates have calculators available for approximate payoutsuse one of those to figure out how much ark you need to have to be making however much you want to make 150 ark gives you around 1 per month
thank you....should i adjust my payout frequency as well?
where do i do that on the ark wallet.... cant find it in settings.
You'd have to register separately with the delegate to adjust that since they're the ones sending out payments Check the ark delegate forum and find whoever you're voting for to figure out how it works with them since each delegate has their own system
