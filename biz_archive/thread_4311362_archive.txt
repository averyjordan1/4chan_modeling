I am currently making good gains on BCC but I am thinking of pulling out soon and taking my gains.
WHat is the next good play to put my money in to be conservative?Or should I hold and wait for the fork?
(Im a conservative investor)
Alts on bittrex.They are all super cheap from people panic selling to try get in on BCC and chase the pump
ETH is as stable as FIAT at this point.
Don't listen to anyone telling you to buy altcoins/shitcoins you will lose your money
Buy NEO/ETH maybe some VTC if people realise PoW is shait
Once you pull out I say throw in 10-25% of your money into RCN once it hits 1500 sats.
This coin has a huge potential due to it already having millions of customers and its exchange opening next week combined with being funded by vitaliks own fund and tim draper
You are correct, check our Safex for example, look at how much it dropped in the last couple months.
1500 satsIts not going that low
