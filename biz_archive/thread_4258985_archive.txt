Any biz bros have experience with commodities trading jobs?
what are entry jobs like?
What impresses employers ?
Like trading paper or the physical?
good risk management
All in on link
I heard you start off with physical before paper - but how does that work?
Please use crypto analogies
OK you are talking about sitting in front of a screen and trading soybeans, crude, and rbob.
By trading the physical I meant for example actually buying a handymax of alloys and selling Railcar or Barge quantities to steel mills.
My advice.
Do the real fucking thing.
Get into silvopasture or ally cropping and start farming pork and chestnuts.
Over the next 50 years you will make a killing if you can get into the silvopasture/ agroforestry space.
Prolly sounds crazy but hey I know my shit I was telling people to invest in BTC when it was a joke.
