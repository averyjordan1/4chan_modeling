tl;dr debt storycame to US with nothing after HS, military brat7.5k credit card debt2x root canals, oral surgery fistula, car repairs.I have a 2k take home, im throwing $500 a month at it.I feel bad
fuck off I'm not giving you my bitcoins bum
im not asking for anything
fuck off dude you're not getting any, stop begging
I was wondering if paying it off $500 is good, or is refinancing with no apr works?

don't give this guy your bitcoins
eat some noodles for a month or two and pay off as much as you can as soon as you can, compound interest is a bitch.
yeah, that sounds better.
But even if I drop 1k a month, Itl take 6 months and that is literally 0 anything
As opposed to 13 months of 50% or 29 months of 25% etc.
currently its 22% apr
