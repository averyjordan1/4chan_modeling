I work at a department store that has fine jewelry for sale.
With some special employee vouchers that are used as "cash" to buy merchandise, I'm able to get anywhere from 50 to 70 percent off the current price of an item.
My thinking is that if I purchase lets say a 14k gold chain (the heaviest I can find) with a sale and my discount, I should be able to essentially get gold for a very cheap price.
Either way I'm getting cheap gold or taking some effort to turn the vouchers into cash.
Besides minimal effort I don't see any downsides to this.
Right?
right.
I guess
Please
Silver is the better bet for eventually justifying the reclamation cost.
