BCH traders should be executed for mutiny.
>muh flippening
Blockstream traders should be executed for mutiny.
What if I just traded the upswings ironically, to take money from those serious BCH traders?
Mossad agent?
Hmph, the King may spare your life...
>tfw have sweaty palms>my hold of btc slipped and I sold the dip>bought back in ~200usd later>lost 0.02 btcI shouldn't be allowed to handle money.
Especially at the the touch of two small clicks.

BUY HIGH SELL LOW.Listen man, you trade like this because you watch the charts too much.
Buy a coin and don't look at its price for a couple of hours.
Hold for t least a few days.
I'm kind of grateful to the BCH scum as it enabled me to buy 4 more BTC at a price I thought I'd never see again.
Buy a coin and don't look at its price for a couple of hoursIt might seem weird but I've actually almost doubled my BTC in like 15 trades total over the past few months.
I've got just under 0.5 so I suppose it's not a lot for most people but still.
In almost every case that I lose out it's been because of me being scared of it leaving me behind.
So you're definitely right about that.I was lucky a couple of times too.
Tfw you bought bch at , sold at 1900, used the profits to buy btc at $5500
