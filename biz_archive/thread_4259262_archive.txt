Fake News
Bitcoin is fucking worthless if it can't control primadonna miners.
Drama every fucking day.
make agreement>get your side of the bargain>fuck over the other side>"k can you guys like stfu and stop complaining already godddddddd"
Honeybadger Bitcoin don't give a fuck about you or what you think.
There shouldn't fucking be "another side".
Decentralized my ass, these fairies run buttcoin like Zionists.
It was a compromise on a 3 year long debate that only became a debate when blockstream faggots entered the scene.
The segwit side now doesn't even need to compromise but finds themselves with no scaling solution for 2 years.
So after 3 years of fighting they cuck out a week from the fork?
Then they'll drum up hype again down the line?
Man fuck these guys they don't deserve to live.
They don't care because of bitcoin cash.
But I still agree they're fucking faggots.
