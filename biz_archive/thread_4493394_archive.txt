I want to buy like 100€ in BTC.
When should I buy?
Serious thread.
right now
Just buy yourself the groceries that you desperately need.
$100 will be $200 in a year, and that's pennies.
Don't starve yourself.
B-but anon, spending money is for poorfags, I want to invest, gamble and make profit.
Bumping for serious answers.
I don't know how is this going to be affected by events like Black Friday, or future holidays.
No one knows little buddy
Are there any exchanges where I don't have to do wire transfers to deposit and withdrawal my money?
I don't wanna lose a bunch of money in bank fees.
Any exchanges let you deposit into pay pal or something?
Then buy shitcoins like HST, POWR, LINK etc.
There hefty fees (maybe 5 out of your hundred euro idk) but a very easy way is to buy BTC/ETH/Ltc on coinbase with a card, then send those cryptos to a wallet on your desired exchange
$ - transaction fees = 95$ in btcwait 1 year.
145$ in btcpull out that 145$ into fiat - transaction fees = 135$you see, investing low amounts is stupid.
50% gains essentially turned into 35% gains, do the same math with 1000 and it already looks better.
looks even better with 10k
I don't want to pull it out, at least not until I can make a reasonable amount.
After it goes up a couple hundred it will crash again.
powr>shitcoinneck yourself anon
Literally no point investing chump change.
Put at least 1k in BTC, ETH, and LTC each.
Wait until next week to see if it crashes this week.
This is the most scared I’ve seen the community.
everything that isn't btc is a shitcoin
Wtf are you all advising, yes start small while you learn, you will probably do some mistakes.
Kraken lets you do SEPA transfers free of charge (takes 2 days after the first one), you can also do it on coinbase if you want
Btw if you go for coinbase I can give you my ref link and we both win 8€ in btc after you buy at least 80€ worth
