I've been using Binance and Gdax so far.
I love Gdax (no fees) but I cannot short Bitcoin there.
What's the best place to do it?
I don't need leverage, just the option to short it.
You should not short the king.
Poloniex.
In a nightmare
Bearish divergences everywhere, my friend.
Thanks, anon.
I don't need leverage, just the option to shortSell BTC for Tether and buy back when it hits your target price
honestly bro I'm 100% sure bitcoin will have a huge correction this weekend and I'm still not shorting it... it's just wayyyyyy too dangerous.
You are going to lose your shit.
I'm speaking from experience.
Just buy a coin that goes the opposite direction of BTC instead of shorting it.
