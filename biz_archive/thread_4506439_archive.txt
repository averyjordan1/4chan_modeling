Teeka Tiwari says "buy FCT up to $50" and long term pick.Whales have been planning on taking advantage of that for a while in back rooms.After manipulating the fuck out of FCT all day yesterday, the pump is ready to begin.Get in now before it's too late.
As someone who missed out on POWR, and sold QSP way too early, I'm not about to miss this shit.
Allready fully loaded
FCT has been a legit operation for a while.
Negative.
Why does someone ALWAYS say this?
Because of this I miss out on things.
Hell, you guys even got me to doubt my OWN call the other day (TenX) and miss out on good profits.If you want to make quick money, I think FCT is about to pump pretty good.
If you are OK with holding, I think this is a 2x or 3x in a few weeks.
I'm locked and loaded since 17$, ready when you are, sir!
:)By the way, for anyone not already locked and loaded, I am NOT suggesting FOMOing in.Look at what it's doing and make up your own mind if you think it's priming for a pump.And always buy on a dip if you can, or set a stop loss if you try to ride an ongoing train.
MILLION USD market cap.
What has this 3 year old vapourware created in order to be valued at 190fuckingmilliondolars ?

It may not be pumping just yet, I may have jumped the gun on that.
But mark my words someone is planning something.I sold and will reenter on a dip.
or maybe i screwed myself.
But I'm not a shill, just a tipster, so full disclosure.
Buy up to 50.
No stop loss
STEEM IS BUY UP TO 2.5 GUYS ARE BLIND?
Steem preparing super cool things for 2018 :)
