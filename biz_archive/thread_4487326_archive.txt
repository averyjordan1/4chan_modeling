I generally agree, but I still think it'll peak a bit higher than that before dropping like a bitch.My guess is ~9.8k in December then drop to ~4.8k and January-March of bear market.
Another whole cryptomarket bull-run will most likely happen again in April-July and ~50k per BTC will be achieved, after than 100k in the next year.
I plan on completely exiting from crypto around 100k.
