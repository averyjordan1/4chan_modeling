Is there anyone more rekt than this little guy?no one gives a single shit about their tournament.
Was the tournament the big news that was suppose to release this month?
i cant be bothered to do reverse img search, wtf is this?
they have a big tournament running nowthe big news was that anyone can start a tournament themselves.
among friends or w/e.
that's the new feature on the platform.
they are celebrating this with more tournaments.
but to be honest I have no idea.
every time that guy hypes up his announcements it's been shit.
So god damn happy I sold this tShit off at 80 cents.
Can't imagine what must be going through people's heads who bought at 2 bucks
I bought not long ago at 35 cents.
Hate it or love it, it looks like it has bottomed.
It's just a.
Matter of time until someone pumps it to Jupiter.

Lol I don't think so man, that ship has sailed a while ago.
I bought this coin back in agaust when it "bottomed" at 70 mill market cAp and sold a few weeks later when it wasn't recovering.
It has been leaking ever since and with the market now hugely over saturated now with so many coins this is one of the worst coins to have.
Ur better off holding one of the more popular coins and hoping it goes up.
