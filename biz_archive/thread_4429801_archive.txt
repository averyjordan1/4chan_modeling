Lets get to it :I suggest you invest some money in the altcoins that are available on the Exodus Desktop wallet.
These coins are going to be extremely favored in this race.
Do your research on it and read about each coin before buying.If you like my advice : BTC : 193MDmNbqQ98KTdu2DbbUUNbtPMte5Khx6ETH :0x3C42a655B6B3944eDAf62f566C05541e60bd256dIf you want I can talk more about it.
you are shilling junk shitzombie coins, yet asking for payment in btc.
yep btc is the only thing actually promoted here
First I considered bitcoin the best.
Now I see how people think about the other coins and traded half of my bitcoin for Ethereum, Litecoin and others.
One of these is going to be king and some can make you rich.
you dont know jack shit anon, thats why you ask for donationsyou're fucking poor as dirt and will stay that way you larping idiot
I am not rich so sure, dont listen to me.
The fact is bitcoin cant do it alone, and this industry is growing like crazy.
From 1000s of altcoins, there will be a few with huge value.
If its not clear, I hope bitcoin stays on top, I have an interest in that, but there is huge opportunity in some of the cheap coins.
