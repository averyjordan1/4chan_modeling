"ARK Core (node) is getting a total overhaul.
We will be rewriting the core from scratch.
What this means for ARK is faster transactions output (tx per seconds), higher scalability, Dynamic Fees, use of Multi Core CPUâ€™s, quicker tx processing, better stability, multiple payment transactions, preparations for smart contract deployments, and tons of other new features - This upgrade is the next step in building the future foundation of ARK and will enable us to further our development roadmap.
