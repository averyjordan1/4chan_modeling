>Apply for a part time job because don't want to work 30+ hours.>Tell manager my availability.>Says he'll make things work.st week everything is working alrightnd week see 38 hours on my next schedule, schedules me a day I said I wasn't available.WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Talk to them instead of complaining on an anime forum?
Should have gotten an office cuck job
Have you tried reminding them about this?
If not, quit your fucking crying you little child
I am going to today, I just wanted to share my tale with you m8s and see if anyone else has had these problems and knows my feels.
This is the ONLY way around this.You say that you have a second job and that you have to work the days you say are unavailable (weekends)
>Monday - Wednesday 8:00 p.m. - 4:30 a.m. Friday 4:00 p.m. - 12:30 a.m. Saturday 8:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Days Off: Sunday, Thursday This is my work scheduleJUST
For example: I used to wedding DJ, but I still tell everyone that I still am
I actually have class on the day they scheduled me so I hope they "understand" and fix it.
You would be a wedding DJ.......
Free drinks and new pussy every weekend.What's not to like?
Sorry bout your luck sir.
I'd quit!
