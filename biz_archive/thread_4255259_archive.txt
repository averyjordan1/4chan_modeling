>There are people who bought this at 150sat.>It's back to 15sat>People on their slack/discord still call you a FUDDER for telling them to sell at 50/100/150/100/50 sats.>People still asking when REDD-ID will come out>People still buying at 15sats>People bought the 40sat pump and are now sitting at 15sats.You listened when we told you to sell, right?
I remember when this piece of shit was 5 sats.
So was bitbean and verge.Glad I went with verge, sad I sold at 30 sats.
Gotta say that I regret not offloading a chunk of my bags when this pumped back up to 40 sats.
But desu I still have blind faith in RDD since I got in at 5 sats and plan to wait until in goes over 100 sats again.
Yea can someone plz tell me any news on this coin.
My brother mined 2 million redds in 2014 and we dont know if we should sell or wait for a moon.
literally been buying this at 14 selling at 16 made 1200 in one day redd coin once made me 3 bitcoin back in the day BEST COIN FOREVER
From 2014What the fuck man you could've sold it in June at 150 sats.
The moon is over.
Redd-ID is going to be 2 years behind with now news on release.It's not going over 100sat again.
IOTAtip does the same thing REDD-ID was going to do, and any one wanting to buy reddcoin sees the dev team is shady as fuck and/or incompetent to keep lying about release dates, remaking the roadmap, and refusing to give news.
bought at 5 sats>held through 142 says>eventually sold at 30>Had 4.8 BTC at one point >felt like KMS after 5k BTC
