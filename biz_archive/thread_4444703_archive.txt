What do you guys think about MTL?
its pretty good on the same level as nuls imo
dead project
low total supply... solid use case.
has actual apple and visa guys working on it.
i don't know, man.
sounds like it could be worth more than it is.
I can see it being worth 1/10 of a bitcoin or even more one day.
it's basically a chad version of bitcoin.
