Hello, 4chan.
Or should i say /biz/?
My Villain Name is "The Indian Devil".
I am the best and cheapest assasin India has to offer.Today, after 2 long years of pursuit, i have finally found AND captured the man known as Satoshi Nakamoto.
With this, all blockchain-technology will slowly crumble away and (THEY) will have no more hindrances left standing in their way to complete world dominance.
For the execution of Satoshi Nakamoto i will be rewarded with 200$.
Which is quite a lot, since a assasination usually only costs 325 Rupees on my fiverr page.
I already bought myself a typewriter, who is currently creating this message.
Add something Personal about you here Rajesh, you can choose what.
Now, since i do not agree with the Jew's overa... i mean (THEIR) overall goal, i will give you people one chance to save him.
If the following Adress reaches 500$ USD in BTC by the end of this Day, Satoshi Nakamoto will live.

Like, what was that film called?
Yes, the one with the puppet man.

Okay, type this:Live or die, /biz/.
Make your choice.
Okay, stop here and post it.
Let's play something with sir nakamoto, he is probably bored.
