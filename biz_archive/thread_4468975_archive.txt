wait a second, is this real?
I woke up not too long ago and I am down over $54K on my investment in CFD.
Can somebody clarify what is going on?
I bought in with almost everything I had when it was .94 cents.
What is happening?
I am seeing rumors that the developers did an exit scam.
Is this true?
Does anyone know why their website is down?
I'm not getting any responses from email or anything.
I feel really fucking sick.
Can someone tell me please what is happening?
Why larp?
virgin lmao
If this isnâ€™t larp this is hilarious You lost it all retard!!
Woke up?
From a coma?
If you had that much money put into CFD, you should've at least had the foresight to check what's going on with it everyday.
Developers exited posting a bullshit reason, all major forums/communication channels shut down.
Sorry mate, you had a chance to sell a couple days ago when the news first broke here
Stop.. loss?
Why not?
Wtf is wrong with you
its a nightmare you wont be able to wake up from.
enjoy
I know how you feel man.
I lost about 20k myself.
Not that much to someone like you, but it was all I had.
I don't know how to tell my wife and her son that we don't have enough money for christmas this year.
