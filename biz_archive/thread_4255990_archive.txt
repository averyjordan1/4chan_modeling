Hello /biz/nessmen, my parents recently let go their facebook page manager and asked me to replace her.
I have never done any marketing and I am not doing a good job.
I have searched for some courses, tips and tricks etc.
but I have not found anything of value.
My parents business is a restaurant and if some of you know some useful no bullshit course, book or website could you please share it with me I would really like to learn.
Also general facebook marketing thread
Learn some quick graphic design (so you can't make some shiny pictures for the sheep on Facebook), learn how to write in an interesting way.
Use words that sounds advanced to the average sheep!
And be #Relateable xDD use emojis, over hype shit and be funny...
Ummmm this is a crypto board sweetie not /g/
This is /biz/ for business you dumb crypto fuck..Only because of bitcoin this board got converted in to faggots trying to find the new bitcoin..THIS IS FOR GENERAL BUISNESS AND FINANCE

What are you doing that's so bad OP?
I'm a socialmedia manager, I might be able to point you in the right direction.
how much do social media managers get paid?
Like a ballpark figure.
So?
Not the same fucking ID
Depends entirely upon who you're working for, size of the company, and which social platform you're working with.
Instagram accounts are probably the biggest earners on the market right now, but that could change if something new comes along.
How big is your parents business OP?
It's just a nice job I guess.. sit inside all day, put on good music, get comfy with a cup of coffee and just post some shit now and then
Turn it into an insufferable meme page.
That's what all the brainlets on facebook are into.
Yea.
