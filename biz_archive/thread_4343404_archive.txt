Should I make any changes?
I've already converted some BCH to BTC while it's at a high (at .25), should I convert more?Brainstorm with me here.
No shitcoin suggestions.
buy more monero
poor fag...needs more alt coins with huge potential gains.
I love Monero, but most of that was bought @ $45.
Not sure I could stomach buying at $120+
