secretly deep inside everybody is waiting for btc to crash hard and prolly hope for soem exchange to go tits up like mtgox.it wont happen this time, it already happened, now its only going up until cryptocurrencies become the new money.trust me.
i am literally AI at this point.
Correction to $4500-$5,000.
Screencap this.
Yeah I'm sure bitfinex is a healthy exchange with no problems and tether is 100% backed by liquid USD.
There's no chance of any funny business there.
So all the new comers to cryptos who know nothing about cryptos and are only buying to sell later at a higher price to the next newbie can rest easy.
Eh...we still have that tether scam that needs to be dealt with.
Yes op your intelligence is definitely artificial
