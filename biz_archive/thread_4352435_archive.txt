Corecucks BTFO.
Better listen to the man and buy BCH before parity or get left behind.
you cant convince them.
just wait patiently like the rest of us high iq peoplewho see the real manipulation is the current btc bulltrap
The more Bch and btc fight, the more Eth wins.... What would you expect him to say?
they think seasoned investors will be bullish on futures.
hahahaha
he doesnt care about pricing, argument invalidated
This desu
he also believes in fucking children
They will raid him and find Masha's collection on his laptop.
I made 10x with BCH.
Haters gonna hate I only bought it to make bank
Previously forks his own coin.Complains about another legacy chain.
He doesnt give a shit about blockchain size, ETH blockchain is at 300 GB right now lol
Why can't everyone just be cool and mine btc.
Why don't they realize how in the long run they'd make way more money than they will if investor confidence is ruined.
He doesn't TALK about pricing.
He talks about utility, but he knows full well that this translates into a higher price.
And he does care about the price, if nothing else it reveals confidence on the part of the community.
But none of that will stop him from prancing about with a cat bag and unicorn sweater like a fag.
