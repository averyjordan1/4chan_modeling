Roger Ver orchestrated this pump and dump masterfully and after all that's happened you people still believe things might turn around.
What happened last night was not the free market choosing BCH over BTC it was just plain old market manipulation.
I was watching the BCH/BTC orders on Bitfinex last night.
Thousands of small orders to buy 0.3 BCH streaming in (clear sign of market manipulation done through bots).After this huge scam everyone who is not already emotionally or financially invested in BCH will avoid it like the plague.
BCH is not going to be able to rebuild its reputation after what happened here.
You seriously think he's selling tens of thousands of BTC that he's had in cold storage for years, just for a quick pump and dump?
He's in it for the long haul.
Suck a dick corecuckThe dump started before Ver even moved his coins.Also hint: Ver dumping his coins is the fucking freemarket retard.
You think there aren't a fuck ton of Coretard whales dumping BCH?Actually... maybe... the Coretards aren't all dumping their BCH because secretly they know it might dethrone their king.
They aren't stupid.
It was for sure a pump and dump but the bots are probably just arbitrage
This pump is only just beginning.Bitcoin will fall to 4900.
BCH will go back up to keep miners happy for the moment.
BCH will continue to spam the BTC network.Enjoy the FUD while it lasts.King BTC will still be here after all is said and done.
