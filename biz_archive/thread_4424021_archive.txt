What was /biz/ like before the crypto mania?
lmao no one nows, everyone is new here, thats why no one responded to ur post
WE WERE DOIN KEGEL REPS OF 20 PER DAY.
WE STILL CONTINUE THIS TRADITION.........UNTIL THIS VERY DAY.
DO YOUR KEGELS OP.
scam threads, occasional finance/job threads.
really slow fuckin board.
occasionally there would be a crypto thread but usually people would say its shite.
also dropshipping
Drop Shipping, scams, the occasional resume rating thread.
A lot more sober but a lot less fun.
This board was created to move doge and pandacoins off /g/ newfag
Idk I think they made this board because too many people was posting about crypto on b
I used to lurk sometimes and I feel bad that what was once a cool comfy board with some quality posters has now become this absolute /b/tier shitfest.
I wonder where all the regulars went.
I wish we could talk about stocks.
The vast majority of people who invest in stocks or cyrptocurrency are only doing so because they think they can sell it for more later, but at least the stock market has a possibility of people buying low and selling high without only profiting from poor bastards buying high and selling low
Kneepads.
40% was 18 year old NEETs asking how they could turn 17 dollars, their toe nail clippings, and a lock of hair into 50 thousand dollars in 3 hours.There use to be a lot on Affiliate Marketing and just general SEO and traffic/lead generating.
Some people actually knew their shit really well.
Sometimes threads on sales and selling techniques (come back Foxbro!).
A lot of questions about business ideas and their viability - I have to say they have gotten progressively worse, the few business idea threads on here are always just brain farts with 30 seconds thought.
In the past OPs would actually Google search at least once before they asked a question.and chapstick
It was slow with lots of drop shipping tutorials.
Also robinhood was really big
