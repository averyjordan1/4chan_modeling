Will it ever recover /biz/ ?
(82 WTC and 30 SALT)
It might.
But don't expect high gains.
Guys I lost $300, please careSorry kiddo, I have a lambo I need to go wax
Why are you investing into SALT and WTC when no one is interested in investing into those coins at the moment?
This market moves fast, people forgot about walton and salt now, onto the new hyped coins, maybe when they've got news you return to them.
SALT is one of the only sure things out there in the short term.
You'll more than recover.WTC is just another greedy zipperhead project.
On the off chance it pops any time soon, the money may spend but you'll never feel clean again
