We have take off boys - dip is over - clear to launch upward>ASTRO-ETH on ED
We're on Blockfolio lads
>clear to launch upwardThen why is that nigger pointing forward?
I love seeing this coin pushing my portfolio up but I'm in it for the dividend so have no plans to sell.$0.125 per coin per quarter per million profit in dividend is too good to sell for a measly 3x ico.
in case you couldn't tell that is a jet....and jets fly upward
Don't tell me which way to go nigger.
I'm turning around the other way now.
Put my sell order in for 20x ico.
Anything under that is not worth it when the dividend pays for the coin.
