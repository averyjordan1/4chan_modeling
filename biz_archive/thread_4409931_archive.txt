How much is my .3 of a BTC going to be worth in 5 years?
.02 bch
1 btc will be either 5$ or 25000$
Either $50,000 or nothing.
Screencap this and look at it again in 5 years.
5$
I want to get up to a full BTC and then hodl as a long term investment but I lost my job and while I’m looking for a new one I don’t want to put anymore of my cash into crypto.
