What do you guys think of my new portfolio?
Trying to focus on high potential coins and a few up and comers.
I have faith in UBQ and NAV especially.
+1 for UBIQ.
High potential coin way overlooked.
NAV is also worth checking out.
Been in the 10k range for a while.
Broke out to 30k in sept and will do it again.
startercoins/10good job for playing it safe though, most people like me are greedy
Can you shill me on this?
low supply, low marketcap coin that's extremely active (they were at a moscow blockchain expo yesterday) and a lot of OG crypto people have bags.
Why no xmr?
XMR is old and its value doesn't move around alot.
Why?
