So did nocoiners buy this dip or are they still coping with muh tether?
Still coping.
Next round of FUD will be the Bitcoin difficulty adjustment in a couple of days.Starting to get predictable now.
There are no "nocoiners" left you brainlet.Everyone owns BTC already, at least on /biz/.
Nocoiners are going to live their life with eternal regret.
