Should I be using BTC or USD charts when running TA on altcoins?
Or just using charts of whichever market has the highest volume according to coinmarketcap?Tell me your secrets /biz/
TaHwhahaha a degree in memery
ETH, by the time you react with transfers using BTC or fiat the opportunity has already passed.
Well what else are we supposed to go on?
Fundementals don't work on smaller time frames.
year ago: BTCToday: USDI like tradingview.com, they have USD versions of all bittrex markets, e.g "PIVXUSD"
Thank you, I also use tradingview.
Why USD nowadays?
btcthat way you can tell if you were better off just staying in btc
Because non-toy (e.g yobit trash) altcoins tend to stay around the same USD value nowadays.
If bitcoin goes up against USD, the altcoin goes down against bitcoin.
Check it yourself on some coins you care about.
In my case, all the coins I care about have a stronger correlation with usd than btc.
Thanks, that makes a lot of sense to me.
I had heard that arbitrage bots keep USD and BTC markets in balance.
