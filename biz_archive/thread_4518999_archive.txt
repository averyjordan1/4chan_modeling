So /biz/ I have some questions about building credit.I'm 21 years old, working a steady job at a hotel that just opened.
At the moment, I don't have any credit history because I've never had a credit card or any loans, etc.
I want to start building some credit, but my current bank doesn't offer a credit card until you've worked at the place you've worked for at least a year, and I'd rather not wait until next October to start.
I'd also like to be able to get a hotel room and do other things that require a credit card.What would be the best way to build credit in this situation?
Do most banks do that "hold a job for a year" thing?
Am I just screwed until late 2018?
