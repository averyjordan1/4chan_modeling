Got my fiat lined up to buy the BTC dip.Don't let me down cashiers
Buy ETH.
Don't question it.
The BTC dip won't bottom for a while.
BTC might have one last push upwards before it finally dies off, don't fomo in.
Of course, if they were successful, that transaction would never make it...
Sadly, there won't be a significant BTC dip this time m8.
I 'm in the same boat as you btw
theirs a majour dip coming, just like always, the pattern and TA is there, even with out bch etc.
How can you even think that their isnt?
