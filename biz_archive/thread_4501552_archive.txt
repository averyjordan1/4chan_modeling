I've been going "all in" from one coin to another and it's really helped me make money.
I've held bitcoin since 2013 and started trading this summer.
I went all in from one coin to another, reaping huge gains ~80% of the time.
Confido was just another coin I went all in on at $1.10, planning to sell at $1.30 or so.When it crashed to $0.10, I was freaking out and I held because I thought it could only go up from there, which it did.
It doubled to $0.20... before crashing again.Now I have a thousand bucks.
Chances are there'll be a spike in the price when the devs come back.
I want to kill myself everyday.
how much money did you have before the crash?
