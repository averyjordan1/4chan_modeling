MFW I realize bitcoin millionaires and miners aren't trying to pump BCH, they just know it will be the new bitcoin and they are trying to unload BTC bags
I think that once this is over and BCH wins, people will start to lose faith in POW coins in general
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
