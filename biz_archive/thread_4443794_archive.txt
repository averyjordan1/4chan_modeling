It is supported by poor pajeets who need to use bitcoin to buy coffee.
Only “investors” with a networth of $2 care about the minimal transaction fees.
It is any surprise they can’t keep the price up with their paychecks?

That's a good memeAnd yeah, a bunch of huge BTC holding companies are selling off their BCH over the next months.As much as I love Cash, I wouldn't expect its value to rise just yet.
Wait like 6 months for more merchant adoption and big biz to finish selling.
It just rose 300% you absolute retard, it's not going to sit at $1200 for much longer.
