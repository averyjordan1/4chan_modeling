Why are baby boomers so rich?
Even the dumb ones?
My mom that's 53 and acts like a moron all the time has a fucking 1.8 million USD net worth.
All her friends are wealthy also, and many did not go to college, my mom went to a fucking fashion school and my dad didn't even go to college, but they owned a 1 million dollar home when they were in their late 30s.
And my dad bought his first home at 100k in the 80s when he was 26 or something.
Which is like 300k in today's money.
I wish I was an adult during the 80s/90s and grew up in the 60s/70s.
My only hope was to gamble on BTC but I'm scared now.
I think crypto is dying out.
prices were cheaper + less competition and more opportunities
Return on capital makes you more money than working in this current day and age.
They have had 1.
Better job market 2.
More time and better opportunities to collect capital 3.
Entirely captured the political sphere
Basically what I'm saying that the more rich you are, the easier it is to get more money.
My mom that's 53that's not a boomer mongo
bull market + 100% employment rate and workers shortage for most of their working life = absurdly high wages.
boom happened from late 40s to early 70s
to /biz/ anyone over 30 is a boomer.
I get called out for boomerism even though i'm under 40.
.8million at 53 isn't rich lol I'll have that way before 30.
It seems like your parents were just smart with money.
I'm starting from scratch, as in I pay for my rent,food,car at 22.
You should be in a better position than me because you can probably ask for 100k to invest.
Quit crying and go make money.
You sound like a bunch of whiney entitled cunt knuckles.
Maybe if you worked smarter and spent less time jerking off to bernie you could actually make something of your life.
She was born in 1964, i think she just makes the boomer cutoff.
generation x is the most cucked.
a generation of boomer cock suckers.
Hey, we have to survive in the boomer hellscape.
Now we need to learn to survive the millennial hellscape.
Man gen x is fucking weird.
A 1.8 million USD networth at age 53 puts you in the 94th percentile.
I'm curious, what does biz consider wealthy/rich?
It seems everyone on 4chan is very poor but decides who is rich or not.
Where did you get that info?
>be born first>less competition, easier to take stuff>create debt for your children and grandchildren to pay while you partyIt is not that hard, OP.
Makes sense 100k invidiuals are in the 94th percentile as well.>Mfw I will literally be the 1%
