We don't talk about May in bizclub
 bigger ROI and better trading environmentHe's not wrong
Many people didn't sell for some reason
Crypto has higher risk but small to medium reward.
Stocks may pose medium reward rarely but the risk is minimal.
The reward is also always there, an increase of 6% ROI in a year is already a lot.
You just keep putting money in it and will multiply.
Stock listings doesn't fade away either, the company has to pay for their investors initial investments if they declare bankruptcy.
Imaginary coins can't, they just fade away like a person's memory.

Dumb stockie
:(
Stocks carry minimal risk, until the market crashes and they worth nothing.
Crypto just moves faster.
Why the fuck would I wait 6months for stocks to dip 10% when that happens in an hour in crypto
My friend lost money therefore everyone that trades crypto has lost moneyKYS you faggot weeb
No reason you shouldn't diversify and put money into consistent winners like ETH or BTC to get your feet wet in the market.
I started on robinhood and did nothing but lose money in stocks half due to the market hours half due to me not knowing what the fuck I was doing.
At least with Crypto it's a 24/7 global market and as long as you're careful with your stop loses you can afford to take risks considering the massive potential for gains.
