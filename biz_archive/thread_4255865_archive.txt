I am so comfy rn I cant even.
I only have 1k link, I just got into the crypto sceen a couple weeks back.
I spent all of the dip last week diversifying my portfolio and now I just want to put everything I make into LINK.
When is the best time to accumulate?Will 5k LINK be enough to eat reeces pieces out of hooker pussy for life?
I like that shit like I like my cereal.
Zap is the new!
Link is dead.
Zap is solving the oracle problem through its oracle toolkit and then they have a marketplace.
just bought 1 million
zap is the new nothing you fucking cuck
Honestly man just buy more every time the price goes down.
And hold it.
Don't ever let go.
This is the next big thing, we just found out about it way too early.
we just found out about it way too earlyYeah, if only I could have found out about it when it was over a dollar instead.
What a shame to have to buy at these prices.
in a similiar position anon, with 1.3k link..I'm gonna try day trade with 25% of that to atleast get to 2k link, no fiat money to put in cuz 3rd world poorfag
what a shame indeed.
i wanted to buy high in true /biz/ fashion
Anything below 20 cents is instabuy imoKys
Have none at the moment ... but feel like it is probably a good time to buy

Honestly bro if you only have 1k LINK it means you are too broke to be diversifying.
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
Put everything you can into LINK and just hold it.
Maybe wait a bit because the price might drop back down a bit.
You can't even what?
