pic is a tool or meme tier?
/Biz don't forget where you came from, Ethereum has been good to you this year make 2018 even better and end 2017 strong amigos.
everything is a memeTA in crypto is fucking stupid cause this market is so volatile something could moon 20000% in an hour then be worth literally nothing the next
surely one is more common than the other though since people are willing to have a go at it and that's cuz they've seen others call things.
these stupid little patterns dont mean shit
What minute setting are those candlestick patterns supposed to be used with?
Good to know you are learning about candles.
Huge improvement on you.Candles stick on btc in my opinions just shows trend, volume.Everything else is just mind games, shill games, cheating games etc..In real markets, big candles mean something.
There is always some news behind them.
Bots trade by analyzing candles and graphs.
People trade just looking at candles and graphs.
Bitcoin is:>moon>saturn>don't 6500 on mek by tomorrow>whalesk people pump and dump>whales, wallsetc.
It's foolish to trade btc looking at candles.50 btc here and there for 12 hours.
A guy with 1000 btc comes in.
People lose their shit.
I remember trading Nokia, man that was some nice up and down, up and down ride for long time.
