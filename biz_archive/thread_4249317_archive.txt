What do you suppose will happen after the fork on Bitcoin?
We may see an initial pump on the alts market from Buttcoiners scrambling to get out but it will be short lived since this may very well trigger a correction.If the correction occurs in Buttcoin you can expect everyone to shit themselves and cash out in safehavens to ride out the turbulence.The Tetherbunker looks pretty damn comfy right about now.
