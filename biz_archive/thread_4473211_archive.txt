Thinking of dumping 1 btc in this scam coin.Is this another 0x?
it's a genuinely useful coin that nobody cares aboutit's probably too boring to pump
some trader said on pure TA it will soar to $342 mid term

It's one of the lesat scammy coins around and - mindblowingly - also one of the few with an actual fucking working product and good usable features.
It's the comfiest part of my portfolio by far desu very bullish on DEXs.Also, you can use your BTS as collateral if you want to take out USD or CNY loans (0% interest) on their exchange which is handy as fuck.
