Thanks for sharing.
Buying a fat bag ASAP.
When will this shiit finally moon?
This is the coin that got me investing.
I'd say this signals the start of the new PR phase that Iexec is probably initiating, I believe they have just done some hiring in that field.
Marketing and PR have been topics that the community has raised at every possible stage.
The lack of marketing for a project with such a high potential and technical/academic/diverse/punctual team backing has created a loyal and intense tiny community (I doubt this is uncommon ) sure that they were getting into the revolution at a bargan.
However this community is begining to become somewhat frustrated at the absolute stillness of the RLC market and its inability to ever get out of this range it's been sitting in for months.
The community blames 2 things from what I've seen 1.
Lack of marketing 2.
Manipulation (I have nowhere near the experience to be sure of this but I'd say it's probably pretty true).
I think the team is very aware that if RLCs become overpriced that would be a liability to the stability of the project so they have purposely flown as far under the radar is they can manage thus far.
Things are now changing, V1 is up, V2 is a year away, new Dapp comp, new Dapp store, small partnerships.
They will be taking this up another notch I bet thus the marketing, thus this article.New partnership announcement this week (probs not too high profile)Gilles is a top head man.
Julien is a bit submissive but very active.
In this poor newbies eyes might be a good time to buy.
Worst case is probs having money sit.0xfe025a5e9e1d67103280ba70ab5c40f68d7ba7f3
