Chainlink has taught me fear, lost quite a lot on it along with the forks...Now I only put $300 out of my $3500 holdings max and never more into a coin.
How can I man up and go all in again?
3500 is not enough to be playing it safe.
scared money dont make no money yo
Lol it depends.
For some people 3500 is everything, for whales is nothing.I think 3500 is a lot of money and you should be really sure about where to put it.
he pulled out
I cut my losses at 41 cents after buying it at 50 cents.
If I didn't pull out I would of been devistated to the max.
I'll tell you howYou go all in on chainlinkYou need to feel like you OWN that coin, you're in charge and you comand that fucker to grow, and it will.
I'm putting all my funds into LINK on a daily basis catching local dips, that's how early retirement is done.So grow some balls, be a man and go all in on this future moon mission
putting money in SIGT taught me a valuable lesson, dont buy into a coin thats not atleast in the top 50 on CNC aswell as being mercilessly shilled on /biz/ yet not heard of outside of it, yeah you might not get your "10x gains" but its a sure efficient way of not becoming an eternal bagholder.
is there a reason its registered on the cayman islands?
only reason is to hide asset away from uncle sam.
Paradise and Panama papers proves this.
go all in LINK, you won't regret it
