Is microsoft still a good stock to buy?
I would like to know too my dude
I don't know much about them financially, but in terms of technology they are getting worse and worse.
Now it's just a pajeet spaghetti code botnet - more and more people are moving to Apple and Linux.
Unless they do a 180 on all their recent retard practices, I don't see them doing well in the future.

What?
Azure's machine learning is awesome.
Mostly talking about Windows.
Honestly, you could do a whole lot worse than MS. Not a bad pick for long term gains.
For personal computing maybe - But Microsoft still has a strong hold on the business computing sector.
yeah because people in general are too lazy to switch to alternatives anyway
True, I suppose time will tell how long that hold on the business sector will last.
Maybe I have some personal bias since I am a programmer and I know what a spaghetti frankenstein shit heap Windows has become over the years.
