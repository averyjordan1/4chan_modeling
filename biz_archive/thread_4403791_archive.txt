Why the fuck are people saying it will take years before LINK finishes their product when the tight-lipped bastard Rory just said they are pushing for it to go live early 2018?
Even Steve said on Gitter they are only reimplementing it not creating from scratch.
Where did he say this?
I"m in the slack and don't see it.
Bags getting heavy eh just remember link has no floor and will dip much further
Someone posted a slack screenshot.
Why dont you ask rory again instead and post it here.
He basically said they are pushing for it to go live earlier in 2018.
I got to save a screenshot of steve's reply in the official gitter though.
It's called FUD.
Specifically, "it'll take 10 years to moon" FUD.
These kids just don't get it.
We got a real winner here.
Stop bein stupid n short sighted.
BUY LINK.
I ain't gonna say it again.
