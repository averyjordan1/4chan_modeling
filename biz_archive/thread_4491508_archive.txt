What if whales move their money to BTG and we see a new pump like the BCC one?
I think it's possible to make a x4 buying BTG at a low price.
What do you think?
not yet
the money will move to BCH before BTG.
because of mining and hash rate
because the whales have millions invested in sha256 hashing power that is useless for BTG
get ready for take off in a few hours last chance to get in
IS IT LIVE RIGHT NOW???!!!
The price is rising right now in bittrex
