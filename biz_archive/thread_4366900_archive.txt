Should I actively trade or just hold?
I was making more money than I was losing while trading but decided it was too risky and stressful so I just let it sit.
Then the alt drain happened when btc went to $7k and I lost almost all my gains.
What do?

When btc was rallying it was activly trading, now its just holding now that btc is consolodating
depends on your personality.
I think trading's really fun and cool.do it with smaller amounts of money and see if you enjoy that.
otherwise just hodl and move on with your life.
