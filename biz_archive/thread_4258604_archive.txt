Is this accurate?What's wrong and what's right?
ETH at 15,000 is wrong.
Well they didnt include chainlink for starter, so i call this fake.
Is $500 iota possible?
Thoughts?
You think XRP will have a 2 TRILLION market cap?
The only thing that is correct in this picture is BTC
Ethereum at 300 is overvalued
LOL or that IOTA with their ONE TRILLION coins will be 500 bucks?
Is it worth buying btc now?
Will it dip soon
IOTA has 2.7 billion not 1 trillion
and ltcit will always be the silver
Ark @5000
I would say that MAYBE it could be this much.
With the surge of ASIC resistant coins here recently, I think Ltc will have a very serious competitor to deal with in order to reach this price.
No way.
$20k by 2020 is way too low
at the rate btc is growing atm, this anon may very well be right
ripple at 50 dollars would be a Two Trillion dollar marketcap lmao
And eth at $15,00 would be a $1.5 trillion cap based on current supply.
Whoever made this graphic is a moron & completely detached from reality.
the xrpjews will do a coin burn as they rayp in more profits, thus shrinking total coin supply.
dont' worry goyim we're already lightyears ahead of you.
Could XRP even do its job without being in the trillions?
If you get the gold bug investors then yea I guess.What 1% of the gold market equates to how much?
