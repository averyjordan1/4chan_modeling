Is WTC gonna drop some more?
I bought at $2 and i believe in it and i wanna buy more.
yea probably its going to bleed until bitcoin does something, I dont even think good news can do anything its completely reliant on BTC as with all alts and with the constant BTC news its only going to climb to greater highs would not be surprised to see wtc at $3 when its all over.
i will have necked myself by then though.
I’ve been watching it very closely.
I would say this is close to the bottom as it’s going to get.
Look at the order book now.
I bought back in about half an hour ago.
Almost all in WTC now.
Too much news about the wallet dropping in December and a video being released this weekend.
Holding a little extra BTC just in case I’m wrong.
boxmining's video i doubt will have that much effect unless you mean the live video of the product in action?
They're trying desperately to do what wabi already hasIn other words, sell
wabiLmao
not quite the the same product but similar.
anyway doesn't matter, money will not return to any alts its just going to swap between BCC and BTC
You made me laugh
They are going to demo some hardware for boxmining since he has been talking shit.
Also half the people running WTC were Samsung heavyweights.
Which pretty much implies top tier Koreans.
Wabi has already done what they're trying to do https://www.wacoin.ioWhitelists still open 12ml cap, easy 10x right here
Bagholding this chink shitcoin.
I hope December and January it takes off somewhat with the releases
it has more in common with Vechain that Walton, to be fair its called Frog money so its meme potential is through the fucking roof lets hope it gets that awesome and lucrative partnership with Pampers for them tasty gains.
