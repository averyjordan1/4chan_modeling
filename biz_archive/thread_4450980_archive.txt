WHY DIDNT I BUY BITCOIN WHEN IT WAS ONLY $7500
Because you know it's overpriced and it's gonna crash to 2k soon.
Just trade shitcoins until you can make 1 btc, don't buy with real money.

Stay the fuck away.
BTC is going to undergo the mother of all crashes soon.
Slower than dogshit, never ending forks, and virtually no utility.
The current price is not justifiable in any sane world.
Says increasingly poor man for 7th time this year.
I've made plenty of money this year.
BTC is a fucking dinosaur and it's clock is ticking.
I actually agree with you, but I see nothing which could properly replace BTC at this time.
Everything out there is just marginally better BTC.
Nothing which is aiming to act as a currency is really changing things up enough
Because the knife has been stopping in mid-air for no reason every time it falls and then suddenly flying back into the air.
But now you have this weird sinking feelings that you are going to try and grab it the next time it falls and it will cut your hand off as falls straight through the earth.
i bet many ask soon, why they didnt buy Bitcoin when it was only $ 8000
I could have been a millionaire if I'd have bought just one Bitcoin.
