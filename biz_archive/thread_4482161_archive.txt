This time tomorrow you'l feel like a chump if you don't get it nowThe DNT token has no core value, other than being able to create your own "districts".
Why would you buy this, other than pure speculation?
If buying for speculation, why would you think this token would gain value when it does not pay dividends, get burned, or have any other way of increasing in value?Do you realise the DNT team have explicitly said DNT is not a token for speculative investing?If you're trying to dump your bags ok, but don't tell me you actually believe this will moon because of anything other than hype and FOMO.
