">"Today you cannot short bitcoin," Duffy says.
"So there's only one way it can go.
You either buy it or sell it to somebody else.
So you create a two-sided market, I think it's always much more efficient.
">CME announced on Oct. 31 it would launch bitcoin futures by the end of the year, pending regulatory review.How will this affect the price of BTC?
>today you cannot short bitcoinWhat an idiot
Institutional investors will be ready to pour in their billions, $1,000,000/BTC eoy 2019
yes anon, they surely won't short the fuck out of it.
and they'll crash the fuck out of it before going long
Not initially.
> Today you cannot short bitcoinHas this white nigger never heard of Bitmex 100x leverage?
This is why BCH won't catch on.
if you think they won't use their first and likely only chance to manipulate bitcoin bigly down with paper money then you're a fucking retard
once bitmex fixes the mega lag everytime there's a big pump or dump on bitcoin they will forever be the best fucking exchange for crypto derivatives
