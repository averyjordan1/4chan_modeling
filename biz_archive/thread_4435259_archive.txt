Hey biz, i'm here to post another easy 3x/4x erc token:1/ Potential new GEM - A decentralized marketplace (aims to be THE decentralized "Ebay").
Already has a WORKING PRODUCT (beta is live).
Engage in e-commerce business without the high fees and privacy issues.2/ CEO is Paul Mahone (Harvard graduate).
He was previously the CEO of Molecular Robotics, the first nanotechnology company to be listed on NASDAQ.
The attention to detail in the white paper and professionalism of the team is top notch.3/ Presale price: 0.20$ (.0006) / ICO price: 0.46$ (.0014) / Current price: 0.28$ (.0009) - The current price is a steal imo.
Total supply: 100m (92m locked for ATLEAST 1 year in case project needs funding to scale).
That puts circulating supply at around 8m / market cap 2m.4/ If another token sale is to occur, it will be SIGNIFICANTLY higher priced.
This information can be found within in white paper.
And it is NOT yet listed on Coinmarketcap!
We are truly the early adopters!5/ The $GEM is BitBoost ($BBT) / Bitboost.net to DYOR / https://etherdelta.com/#BBT-ETH / This is NOT financial advice.
/ Buy & sell when you see appropriate.
/ My personal strategy is to buy & hold until CMC listing / Take responsibility for your own decisions.Side note: I also remember @cryptocole shilling this a few days ago, but he took it down because volume was so low it pumped really hard.
Said he would post about it again when volume rose.Looks like a high quality gem to me, I can easily see this doing a 2-3x ICO price no problem.
ICO price was .0014 and it's barely hitting .001 now.
safe to buy up to 0.0014?
I would personally think so.
it's not even on CMC yet.
Forgot to add, the info is also on reddit!
Good find OP!
Not my find DESU, i stole it from reddit from a guy who stole it from twitter (LUL) but wanted to help out my bizbros!
why the fuck a wild desu appeared from nowhere
Thanks!
