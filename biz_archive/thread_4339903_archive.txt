I couldn't live with myself If I ever get trapped in a such obvious pump and dump coordinated by Bitcoin Judas and that greedy manlet chink.I would suggest you to commit sudoku asap
I feel bad for the kimchis that bought at $2500

keep spamming this in threads, but it's still fake news
YEAH I BOUGHT THE DIP ALRIGHTAT 0.3 YOU PIECE OF SHIT JIHANNNNNNNNNNN
Wich will vanish before even touched.
Fake mental buy walls lol

Right now unfortunately is digital gold and not cash.
I would love fast tx and low fees, but at the moment is simply not possible without jeopardize the decentralization.Segwit, MAST, Schnorr signatures, Lightening are steps in the right direction.The devs took very long to implement this protocols, since they test, and retest over and over again so they are sure that there no critical bugs like Ethereum or broken algorithms like the Btrash EDA
