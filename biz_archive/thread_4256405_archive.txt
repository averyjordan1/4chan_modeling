Spending money on shitcoin instead of ethersWhen you are going to realize that the smart contracts are the only way the cryptocurrency can evolve as a concept?
Yes, smart contracts, not the pathetic Bitcoin scripts.Now go and buy some ethers, faggot

Isn't that the thing that some kid can freeze your money or something?
I don't want to lose my money fella!
