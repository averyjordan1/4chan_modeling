What entry points are some of you looking at to get into BCC?Don't be a scared little pajeet, a pump is going to happen again.
Below 1k is fire sale.
I will buy the capitulation wick at 500 or lower.
Anything else is too expensive for this shitcoin
If it corrects to like $800 I'm going all in and won't sell till $2.5k
I still have 0.06 butts from before the split and just intend to hold them infinitely as long as I don't have any way to spend them proper, i.e.
outside of an exchange.
