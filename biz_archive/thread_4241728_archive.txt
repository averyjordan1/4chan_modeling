I told you.
$60>MoonLitecoin is the oldest altcoin and still struggles to break past $50.If you are still holding in hopes of glory then it is proof that you don't understand crypto
I was around when there were only 10 altcoins.
I do remember seeing Litecoin there.
Was it really the FIRST altcoin?
Even I don't know for sure
Peercoin feathercoin and litecoin Good old days kek
ah yes, tine for the once in every 4 months movement
are yuo guys pumping and dumping litecoin?
I like LTC because it's more stable than most.
But I don't know if it will see fantastic short-term gains.
Long-term no doubt.
Prepare to be very surprised then.
post segwit2x fork is going to be beautiful for ltc : )

It was the first And because it has a face attached to the coin I was hesitant to buy just like ETH and now I live in pure ragrat
Haven't bit on /biz/ for a month, and I remember a faggot saying the same thing.

Nope.
