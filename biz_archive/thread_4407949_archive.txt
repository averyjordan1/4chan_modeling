What did they mean by this?

pajeet won't talk about kyber until it lists and has gone 5x.
did you see anyone tell you to buy IOTA before it went 2x this week?
or buttcoin cash when it was $300?
correct.
Just bought 2k, lets go.I remember Monero getting pumped like a motherfucker when it got listed on korean exchanges
kek, ironically LINK and kyber make up 80% of my portfolio
But like no one is talking about it.
I can barely find any information.
what else is there to say?
getting listed was a matter of time.
where do you even buy it
Binance
