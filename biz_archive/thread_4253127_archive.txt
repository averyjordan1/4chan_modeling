Super easy gains thereBuy komodo now as long it stays under $3, price is not even mooned yet like other coinsSell on Friday, before monaize ICO
you're so late, I bought in below $2 and sold off most of my stack, I have little holdings in it now.
Komodo rallied pretty hard to almost $3.
Not sure it'll go more than that without hype unofrtunatly
