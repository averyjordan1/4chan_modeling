People saying we are passed early adopter stage are just revealing how much of a loser they are, their entire life is internet forums lol
based
I was saying that in 2015, past me was a cuck desu senpai
We're still in early adoption stage.
for altcoins we are early adopters because most just came out a few weeks ago.
i study CS and i do not know anyone who invested, let alone a large amount, so i think we are set by 2020 boys !
Probably there were more people owning BTC.
Why on earth would you share that info in a class?
It's nobody's business there.
There is exactly one person among my friends, who owns 0.4BTC and he heard about it from me.
That's all.
We are still in early adoption stage for sure.
