Why are re'q fags so annoying, and trying so hard?
While OMG bros sit here silently accumulating the next king.
I'm all on OMG as well, but smart traders are splitting their stack right now.
REQ is due for a pump with mainnet releasing Q4 2017 with OMG having their stuff releasing in 2018.
Will sell the REQ pump, putting it into OMG in time to have a shitload ready for next year.
Do this.
I guess you missed the original OMG days.
This board was full of OMG pajeets when it mooned.Now it happens with REQ and you will miss it once again.
OMG has no more epic crypto gains left with this high market cap.
But i guess you don'T care about the truth, just a bait, huh?
Can someone r8 my portfolio:>BTC33%, bought low during the BCH ATH, so I'm hoping it hits 10k here soon.>ETH, XMR, LTC 33% in these, mainly playing swings since they're relatively stable, but also not bad LTH.>VTC, GRS 17% in these, just as a "flavor of the week", though VTC isn't a bad mid term hold once the halvening hype hits for December.>LINK, NEO, ARK, OMG, REQ, RCNBasically I don't even know what any of these do, but I have my last 17% in this hoping for either LTHs or moon missions.And I'm looking at picking up IOTA, WTC and NAV just because I sense an upcoming flavor of the week in these.
basically I don't know what any of these do>LINK/NEO/ARK/OMG/REQ/RCNThey all solve the oracle problem anon.
You bought 6 competitors for the same thing.
Oh dear, boyo, you fucked up.
Nice skateboard meme, nigger.
NEO/ARK/OMG/REQ/RCN>oracles
4325098Lol, one of them should win then :-) Is there seriously no synergy between any of them?And desu, my post was a bit baity, since I don't hold anything other than ETH, VTC, GRS and RCN, but I plan on divserifying towards what I mentioned this week, after some research and shitposting.
