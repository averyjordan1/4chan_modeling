Can we have a serious discussion about this coin?It is from a technological point the best coin that is out there and super cheap right now.On the other side the name sucks, their advertising sucks and they cancelled DGB gaming (which is said to be revived?
)Also will this coin ever get rid of this terrible P&D stigma?I think so, but I'd like to hear some opinionst.
someone holding 2 million
After the big partnership with Mojang , turn out to be not true , a lot of people droped their bags and moved on.
It's super cheap because there is no demand for it.
It's on a slow way to obscurity.
It hit the meme 100 sats markLiterally a good time to buy
My biggest losses are on it.
It will take a lot of gains consistently to get me to look at it again.
Not a sudden pump
It is literally the better version of BTC.
Faster, more secure, and Jared has been hustling since the inception.
He is in the hotbed of crypto over there in Asia.
With 79% of BTC mined and only 44% of DGB mined, that hashing power has to go somewhere.
With BTC on the edge with BCC, BTG and whatever forks they want/need to do, DGB is a logical contender for a huge influx of money.Jared is playing the long game, not a short-sighted pump and dump.
I suggest anyone who is serious about investing and not just day trading take a look at it and do your research.
still here.
still holding.
how does it scale?
the answer to that is probably what would get people to buy
better than BTC.
Already doing almost 300 TPS, where BTC is still lagging behind.
They anticipate 2000 or better by 2020, not that far away.
BTC is slow and old.
It was good for what it was, but we have better stores of value and digital transaction mediums now.
The only reason BTC is still the king is because people are so heavily invested in it and i guarantee you people are looking for an exit.
Its going to be very hard to mind BTC in the future, block halving and more mining power, higher difficulty.
