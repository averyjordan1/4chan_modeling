opinions on stellar (XLM)?
Seems to have possibilities for use in business, especially with IBM.
The connection with Linux Foundation Hyperledger is also intriguing
good long term
should be good long term hodlsmall time crypto people hate RIPPLE but seem to like XLM they have some ICO stuff coming out and more partners.
Supposedly they'll be involved with a project w/ @Jack and his cash app.
Not to mention they already have their early seed investor/partnership that I'm sure will want to do business with them down the road.
