Doesn't really matter now.
The difficulty is going to adjust, BCH is going to have 20% of BTC's hashing power unless it tanks.
>don't worry, the mempool is going to clear out now that the miners are back on BTC!

More like memepool amirite?
Are you stupid?
That has fluctuated wildly until the BCH algorithm levels out.
It is based on the last 144 blocks mined and it has gone through wildly different difficulty in that time period.
Everything at 100 sat/b and below isn't going to get confirmed ever, it will just get dropped from mempool after 2 weeks.2500 tx per 10 minutes is just not enough!!!
this, the best core could manage was 90k unconfirmed transactions, and it's back to 100k now.
the BCH upgrade is working flawlessly, proving that cash's teams of devs are leagues above coreshitthank you based roger
Press S to short>S
90k unconfirmed transactionsI was surprised how low they managed to get even, I figured they would never scrape below 100k.
But the basic effect I predicted is definitely showing up: mempool filling up, tx fees now back at 800 sat/b, and it's only going to get worse.
