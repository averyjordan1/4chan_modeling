what's a good blockfolio-like web app?
I heard excel with some scripting would be good.
CryptoCompare is okayand there is CoinTracking.info as well, it's got a lot of features but is ugly if you can put up with that.
i thought about making my own app but surely there's something good aroundthanks pal
