biz im thinking of starting up a bitcoin wallet for myself.
Any websites, tips or tricks on how to raise money for myself?
Also, what can I do with it as well?
You're best off buying some bitcoin stocks if you're just starting out with some small money.
Or use Bitconnect as thats the easiest option for most people.
