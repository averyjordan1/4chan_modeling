So BTS deposits and widthdrawls are frozen on Poloniex, and the prices on their are about 1400-1500 sats while on binance and other exchange its about 1700-1900 sats.
Would it be wise to make a poloniex account and buy my bitshares there then when they unfreeze the wallets I can sell it for higher on other exchanges?
