no matter how badly you've been handling things this past week, at least you're not this guy.
i am that guy, it's true.
it was supposed to be my flippening!!!
Lol
ETH is holding week though, what's the problem?
He's not wrong you know.
It's #3 but it's not crashing...
a breakout of $320>muh 3% gainssome people were just born to be poor.
Wait so is ETH safe or not?
It's true though.
BTC is technologically inferior to ETH and the network effect will eventually diminish.I hold both though.
current market price is dictated by hype, not innovation
Don't worry brother.
The fire rises.
