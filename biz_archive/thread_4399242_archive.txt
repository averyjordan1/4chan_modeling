Pos
Interesting... What are some stable PoS coins with a good payout?I'm currently staking ARK and unfortunately still staking a bag of ODN on a Raspberry Pi.
Im gpu mining with a couple of computers at work, and im getting like 20$/30days.Tho kinda planning on setting up a rig i think i can get mine hands in alot of cheap 7770, tho not really sure yet if it worths
Would you recommend mining coins manually, or just selling computing power on something like nicehash?
I kinda rater mine, i dont really trust nicehash idk why but i dont like it
ASIC is better for passive.
Set to BTC and forget.
With GPU you have to switch around sometimes.
If I buy good ASIC now how long will it last before I have to replace?
