What the fuck is up with this website just signed up to buy a small amound of btc only £25 because i wanted to get some link.
Buy it they take £1.70 which is fair enough but sending to my binance wallet they take off £6 its also been trying to send for an hour and nothing has happened feel like ive just been raped.what should i use instead of this shit
>they take off £6 its also been trying to send for an hour and nothing has happened feel like ive just been raped.Bitcoin transactions cost a lot niggaNot for poorfags

Would it be better to buy and send over ethereum, i used to use a btc atm down the road amd that only tool 10%

transafer to gdax then set a buy limit near the price and wait for it to execute.

Buy eth or ltc if you want to transfer it somewhere Bitcoin network fees are sky high and growing it's only useful for speculating.
Also, use Euros.
No fees on CB.
