Are we talking about tezos here?
You know what proves im a whore that gets shilled?I bought this two days ago, had no idea what the fuck it was.Thanks OP
i just dont see it, this website has some shitty design desu.
You probably shouldn't buy on ED.
You'll just fuck it up.
You're probably right, I am used to bittrex ED's design just seems fucking complicated
The mobile UI and ANN thread look nice but their (AstroToken's) website looks like garbage.
debating still getting in doe.
it's been on ED for 4 days and there's 3 groups of pre sale jews who got in at 20-30% off.
there's only 5 pages worth of pajeet babbling.
also cindicator will be out in a week with their ICO rating service.
maybe if you hopped on this the first day it hit ED, not now.
you're late, don't be desperate.
No you didn't you larping gay loser.
Thanks dood I will avoid the bagholding cucks.
pre sale bought at 70cents, regular ico buyers bought at $1.
it's been on ED for 4 days and it's $2 right now, while they're shilling it here.
if OP pajeet wanted to help you he wouldn't have waited until it was 2x to tell you all about it.
because this shitcoin has no use caseWhich country will adopt this ?
it's a fund retard.
any interested investor can "adopt"
