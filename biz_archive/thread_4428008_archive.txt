Should I do it?
I think it's gonna explode real soon..
I already have a bag of 1900
im balls deep into it
I'm all in ARK so my opinion is biased but this shit is about to pop off like crazy ARK is so cheap for what it is and there's nothing stopping it reaching NEO levels especially now that its going to start trading on korean markets in 2 days apart from that next big things are Mobile wallet and Business entity anytime in the next few days.
December/january should be ark core 2.0 which will allow the completion of arkvm and push button blockchains.
At this point we will already be on the moon.
Absolutely.
4428047It's just a prank bro
At the very least it'll recover to around .00045-48 ish after the NEO/BCH hysteria dies down, plus probably a little mooning when the mobile wallet is released soon.
proofs
I only have 200, want more but unwilling to part with ETH.
2019, year of ETH, 2020, year of ARK.
That.
Is.
All.
