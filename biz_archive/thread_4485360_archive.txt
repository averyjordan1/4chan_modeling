Hey, can some non-brainlet explain something to me?
There are rumors going around about the next flippening etc, but the BTC difficulty will actually get adjusted DOWN and not UP see pic.
Is this 100% proof that nothing will happen and BTC will become even more profitable to mine?
it doesn't matter if it's a little up or down, if hashing power switches to BCH it will take an eternity to mine 2016 blocks
Whz should it switch in the first place_ If BTC keeps going up or even stazs the same it is way more profitable to mine BTC even on harder difficulty like now.
And it will even go down... why switch?
Why should anything happen at all?
Because them chinks have huge mining power on their own, and they have every interest to switch to BCH so they can control crypto currency going forward.
What do you mean by "they"?
Wtf are you talking about.
There are hundreds of mining farms in china, they don√Ñ't give a fucka bout any coin only about $$$.
They mine what profits them more which is BTC.
Wah i hold quite a bit of BCH but will sell it now there are just no arguments beside chink consipiracy theories for BCH.
