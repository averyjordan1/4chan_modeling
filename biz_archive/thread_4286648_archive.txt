Why did you go REQ for short term gains?
oh boiii
Not much for many, bust still
Managed to get about even for the week.
No screenshot because blockfolio gets me too anxious from checking every 5 mins.
How do you do this?
Some new version, can't find it on Playstore tho
Why didn't you faggots short bitcoin if you wanted massive gains?
