Get your space suits ready for a real moon mission, faggots.Have you heard of Monero?
The actually-private cryptocurrency that's gained a shit-ton of value?
Let me introduce you to SUMO.SUMO was forked from Monero, so carries the same fungibility and privacy.
SUMO was created in July for research purposes, and now has four developers.
They've already built a GUI wallet and miner (not easy on cryptonote) and just introduced the first part of the code for sub-addresses, a feature that makes it easier to use crypto frequently without revealing your funds.Read about sub-addresses on github here: https://github.com/sumoprojects/sumokoin/pull/28These devs are building features that may be useful even for Monero.
SUMO is cooperative in spirit with Monero and adds value as a testbed for new features.
Think of it like Monero's Litecoin.And SUMO currently has a market cap of 1.1 million.
Loads of potential here for an absolute rocket.
Let's get on board and build a community.https://www.reddit.com/r/SumoCurrency/
