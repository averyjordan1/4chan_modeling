>Got 8neo at $30> have 8700 LINK just sitting underwater.
>Should I pull my link out from underwater and buy neo >Hodl the next day or so and watch it like a hawk?
>Neo seems stable for now >Still feel that it could 2x.> Then just buy back link while it is still low??
>is this a dumb move /biz/ is it to late?
It's like $1000, jesus who the fuck cares.
Might as well keep it in link since neo won't ever feasibly moon enough for you to have any real money
I only bought 14 neo under $30 too, lmao I seriously don't think its a good move to buy when you're already a winner.
Listen to me, there will be many opportunities in the future and NEO need tons of money to pour in to make another big moon
Why, so you can buy at the pump and sell at a loss again?
pulled my Link out of cryofreeze when BCH was 800, haven't looked back.
Thanks anons!
For talking some since into me.I will just do what I always do with my link.
And take my gains on neo when the time is right.
Anyone have any predictions on the neo
