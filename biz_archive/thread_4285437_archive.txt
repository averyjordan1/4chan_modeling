I have a question.What the hell is with these all random TOKEN offerings?what the actual fuck is happening?Who the hell bake those tokens and what is their purpose?
I don't get it.Last time something like this happened was random fiat openings, creator stake sell off and project abandonment.Why is this different?
icos are cancer and we can all blame ethereum for simultaneously improving and royally fuckng the crypto market.
Itâ€™s not.
With much luck 2-3 tokens will succeed.
what is token?share in the crypto company?
crypto coins?
what is it?
