Golem is almost 6 months late on the Brass there is nothing saying it will be released before 2018 while Iexec has already its product out and its appstore coming.I don't even talk about the fact that 1 month the chinaman will know about RLC thanks to the chinese website and marketing.He will ask himself why the fuck stupid round eyes didn't already pump this shit to 500 millions marketcap while buying every single coin in circulation.
Yep, sonm and elastic will die with it.
RLC is looking like its going to the moon here in the next day or so.
good time to buy
Volume trippled today, will lift off soon
Does Iexec have working product?
I have not heard about this yet

Yep, they do, they are releasing dApp platform very soon.
yes they just announced some good stuff today that coming within the next month.
things are looking great.
Their Trello board has no activity.
Like nothing really happening in the last couple months.... Am I missing something?
Yep, golem is fucked.
pajeets trying to shill their bags from the last pump
Like nothing really happening in the last couple months.... Are you joking?They released their fucking product a week ago, you can try it here:https://www.katacoda.com/sulliwane/scenarios/hello-worldAlso the Appstore will be released in December and there will be a Dapp challenge with a substantial bounty at that time.The coin never had any pump, check CMC.
i'm investing all my shekels, tired of being poor.
good trends, i'll throw few coins in it
Put 1btc just for shits and giggles
Just cancelled my sell at 10k, I'm pretty sure this is gonna do a 3-5x in the the next month.
> tfw amazon cloud service has a 190 billion evaluation> tfw RLC has a better outage-tolerant protocol than amazon cloud service> tfw RLC allows its clients to better monetize their idle CPU resourcesthis is one of the biggest projects in the cryptomarket and it's the next ethereum next to OMG
Please don't shill here.
This will go regardless.Literally retarded
