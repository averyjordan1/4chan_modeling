>daily link threads>buy don't, miss out, great coin, x10Down 50%Are linkfags honestly retarded?
It's going to be a great coin it's just that it's not going to take off for another year probablyIt'll still be this price or lower in january/february so you may as well just hold eth or bitcoin until this
What's funny is that they've been saying this since it was only down 1%, and all the way down, too.
And all the way down, they'd say "It won't go any lower!
"That right there should be a red flag that they have no idea what they're talking about.
Basically anything to get you to buy their bags.
You're gonna be one of the normies that buys my LINK for $12 each
Are linkfags honestly retarded?Yes.
