>be me >buy power ledger during ICO>only seen about 3 threads about power ledger about how everyone should get on it before it moons>Powr Ledger starts mooning+ threads about powr ledger in one day Jesus fucking christ, /biz/.
You all listen to shitcoin threads, but disregard the good coins.
How's Chainlink, Ark and Digibyte going?
I bought into ARK at 2.50 it's around 3.30 nowNo Link or Digibyte Personally i researched on my own and have invested in RNC and ETC as well as LTC and ETH
Also almost forgot been exchanging my ETC for EOS inside my Exodus.
I have about 15k built up from about 3k investment.
Nothing to brag about but still it's been decent so far.
Haha I bought POWR ICO too.
This board is full of idiots.But I did find out about POWR through biz back in September.
There is gold in the midst of biz...You just have to be smart enough to see it
Wait til these dorks see the moves ChainTrade and DCORP will pull.
I think I'll travel for a few years
Where do you go to buy into ICO's approved by exchanges?
particularly binance.
i dumped my ico bags at .22 last pump.
now i'm worried
Just wait till TRON coin blows up.Just kidding.
All in on POWR
help some anons that dont have the time to browse
i got in early on powr not sure whether to sell or hold
Get out for the short term.
The Bittrex moon won't hold.
traded a nice little short run against it last night.
woke up to it trading higher than my exit.
oh well.
seems like a decent coin.
might buy in again on a dip
