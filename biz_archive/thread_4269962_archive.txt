Worst performing ICO of 2017, by far.Team leads are a spic, a chink woman, a muslim and a numale.
Looks like pol was right all along.Is anyone else hodling this POS coin ?
How are you coping with this ?
Yeah, it was the worst.
Arrogant team too.
Made a post some hours ago.
Do you have any Info what they are doing right now?The Nazi team kicked me out of telegram, this is worse than 70 year ago.
a bunch of SJW minority snowflakes.No relevant update, they are just "working".
And if you dont FOMO on this POS coin, you are just FUDing.
I have a strong policy of not sell at a loss, be patient, but is really hard with this AIR shit.
Got a "strong policy" of not selling at a loss too, but oppurtnity costs are weighting more.Already transfered it to ED, wanted to sell yesterday, wasn't even possible due to the LOW volume.
Guess i forget about it and hodl 1 more months, let's see.
yeah... nobody is interested in this POS coin.
Opportunity cost is heavy, almost anything else is mooning, even Dogecoin.
So glad I dropped this shitcoin with fairly minimal losses.
That was a smart move.
Got cucked for my refund by the nazi team.
