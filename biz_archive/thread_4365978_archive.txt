The year is 2025.
Society has adopted cryptocurrencies.
You pay for everything, everywhere now with all your bitsats.
It's November, voting day.
Presidential election.
Donald Trump is running for his 3rd term.
You wait in line to cast your vote.
Leaving the booth, you feel confident, inspired, almost enlightened- you pull out your phone.
Open the HST app.
And watch each vote across your district, state, country and world eventuually trickle in throughout the day, each vote confirmed, impossible to change or alter, votes are taken as face value, no more gerrymandering the states.
It's decentralized.
As the clock strikes midnight, you eagerly await the results but almost by chance, you catch a reflection of yourself in a mirror, and you wonder-- who really won?
Everything you need to know in the HST megathread 
The Russians!!!1111!!
