Make sure you do!
we'll never forget you, OPyou are etched on our hearts forever.
You expect Bitcoin to go to $8000 before it corrects?
How much new money can there be when we already went from 3k to 7k without any big correction?
Thanks, anon!
4chan makes friends for life.
There are 2 options:1.
The correction is already happening.2.
It will happen at 8300 or so.
In this case, the money will be mostly new, those 100,000 people joining Coinbase on a daily basis.
Also, people who buy now that the SegWit2x uncertainty is over.
Markets hate uncertainty.
Finally, a bit of money flowing back to Bitcoin from alts.
Im currently holding 5000 Link but did a SEPA transaction to kraken 2 days ago to buy additional 4000 Link.
So the money sits on kraken right now......should i wait for another dip or buy right now?
I think the next news will take a while so it will probably drop till then?
