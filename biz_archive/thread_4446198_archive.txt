I'm about to lose my last penny if Neo drops to 27.768.
I started with 5k 4 months ago.
Iâ€™ve heard of losing some money in crypto, but how do you lose all of it?
so thats where all my money is coming from
How?
You act like you have to sell it when it dips.
You start trading, instead of choosing a few coins and holding.
You also go on margin on bitfinex, so that happens faster.
Tried to warn you about shitcoins.
did you fucking short?don't fuckingshort
started with 500 a month ago im on 3.2k nowAMA
no, i went longthis is why i'll lose if it drops
how the fuck can you go negative going long?y'all niggas need to learn to HODL
i bought at 43.79 with 2x margin
Crypto is a zero sum game, for someone to win, a lot of people need to lose, some of them badly.
That's why you never fomo, and if you're new take your 15%-20% profits, GTFO and never look back even if the coin moons 2x-3x after you exit, never regret.
Take it slow and steady until you get experience.
i can't believe i'm so stupidthis is going down, right??
buying on marginanon plsthat's just as bad as shortingunless you got the money to investdon't
