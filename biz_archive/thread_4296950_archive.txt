Up 10% since my post.
Get in here!
looks like it's over
I'm the op of last post.
That's not over.
It's growing fast days after days.
But it's not too late.
It isn't listed on CEX.IO now, but soon, it's an easy x4 as soon they are listed.
I don't want to be dumped it looks like it's at the top now
WHERE DO I BUY??
You can get it on Etherdelta.
Buy now.
You'll not regret it.
Volume growing fast.
It'll accelerate cex listing processI bought this coin till the beginning and it never stopped growing.
The burn will finish in to 2-3 days then there'll be only 2M coin remaining.
That's an easy 1/4/5$
I'm too much of a brainlet to use etherdelta.
DO I have to select a sell in the order book in order to buy, or do I create my own order?
Its crazy how fast its growing rightnow.Any word on whenits getting listed on Cex?
You can do both.
But selecting a Sell Order (red) and buying it is the fastest way.
Ok I'm buying it, hope it continues to moon.
Ty mate !
This is still ridiculously cheap, they're burning until there's only 2 million tokens left.
Market cap isn't even 1 million yet.
This will easily x2 today due to the volume.
It'll, you can sleep with your 2 eyes closed
Here's my first post about this shit 3 days agoPrice were 0.0002 eth, now it's 0.0011And token burn isn't over
FUUUUCK I saw it but I didn't knew how to use Etherdelta yet because I'm a little bitch.Do you know when it's gonna get listed on a big exchange?
Devs paid for mercatox listing, and cex.io can list them up to 30d .
But if volume continue increase like that, it'll be soon as we think
