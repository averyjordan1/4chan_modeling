Something is wrong here.
The marketcap rose more significant than the price.
Was it overvalued or is it undervalued?
Overvalued atm but buy it when it dips to 1.5 as it will go to 2.0 by the end of the year.
EOS is a scam
They have a near infinite amount of coin and they're still in an ICO which will continue till the end of time.
Just another one of teekas failed calls.
Dump this ASAP
It's not, Larimer always creates something that is technically useful, but not everything gets adopted.EOS has, however, one of the greediest ICOs of all time and that 1billion ICO is sure to be partially spent propping up the EOS price to build platform credibility through perceived investor confidence.
