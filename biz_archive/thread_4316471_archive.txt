<-- These people can't stop their trades from before the BCH crash
It's the greatest JUSTing of all time.
Witness my friends upon the field of pink wojacks and red candles.

people don't trade on chain you fool
Actually, they can.They just need to send another transaction with a ludicrously high fee so it gets priority.
That way their prior transaction would fail because its trying to move money that was already moved.
