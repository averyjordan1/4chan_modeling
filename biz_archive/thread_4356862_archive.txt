Hey guy needs some help , maybe any of the high IQ guys could help meIs there anyway you can profit if bitcoin trades higher in your country(10-15%) than the coinbase price?Considering localbitcoins is the only place to buy here, so if I sell high I'll also have to buy high
> what is arbitrage
No, you can't.
Unless you find an outlet, where you can convert fiat into BTC for cheaper.
yeah I feel the same
I said only intellectual people are allowed
You would need someone in another country to send money to.
This person buys BTC with your money and sends you the BTC.
You sell it for 10-15% profit in cash.
Repeat over and over.The problem would lie in this person converting fiat to BTC.
He would have to use localbitcoins.com as well.This is definitely doable, though.
Sending money to foreign countries throughs banks is risky stuff.
I don't want to be involved in any investigation
