>platform going live in DecIf you haven’t bought yet, now’s a good time to do so.
Picked up a nice bag of 1,500 SALT a few weeks ago.
Comfy hold.
Also the credit cards are scheduled for Q2 2018.
what date in dec?
tfw all i could afford is 166why live?
What are the credit cards?
How do these work?
I fell for the "its $25 on the site so at $5 it can only go up" meme too:(
I only go for the comfiest holds.No exact date announced but Dec is confirmed.Basically same as a regular credit card but your credit limit is determined by how much crypto you want to put up as collateral.
Oh and no credit checks.
That meme doesn’t really hold true until they actually launch and people start using SALT to pay down their loans.
But that will be happening soon!
Basically same as a regular credit card but your credit limit is determined by how much crypto you want to put up as collateral.That is really cool.>tfw not enough to buy more SALT
Yeah the neat part is initially if you open a loan, you need to link it to your bank account, but when the credit cards come out you can just bypass the banks entirely.
Dubs and you give me 5 SALT
