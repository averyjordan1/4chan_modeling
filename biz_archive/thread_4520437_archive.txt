I'm 20% on etp already, should i pull out or will it keep mooning?
was skeptical at first since it's chinkcoin, but then i saw that one of the devs has a thinkpad.
it will probably keep mooning just make sure to catch the peak in a few days
Some TAfag predicted this pump and claims it will pump up to $7
