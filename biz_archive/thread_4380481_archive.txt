http://fapcoin.io/Fapcoin looks like it may be accepted on livejazmin and its starting to get hyped because of that.
If a platform starts using fapcoin, it is gonna moon.
Good luck bros.

i called regalcoin just remember my name
already sold mine for 1000% profit
I think there will likely be a cam/porn crypto that will moon, but there are a bunch right now and I haven't see anything indicating which one will win out.
There's fapcoin, sexcoin, titcoin, kencoin.
Real talk, which is best?
Are they call shit?
Wait and see?
None of them have a unique selling point.
I'd wait until a new coin develops or one of them gets a usp.
As it stands there is no reason not to just use a standard cryptocurrency to pay for porn.
