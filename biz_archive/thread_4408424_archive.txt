So I've got 4 antminer S9's coming my way, claimed 13.5 TH/s, let's call it 12 to be conservative.I have 8 month left in my lease with electricity included and my landlord having no recourse to charge me for the spike in usage I'm about to generate.Will I make it?
No
There's probably a clause in your contract about 'reasonable usage' of electricity.Check that out before celebrating
Depends what you mine.
Pick a winner which grows well and you will.
I measured mining monero this year after nicehash went ...not nice.
I got pulled over the table with electricity rates , but the growth of xmr end up making me a fortune.
You can make it anon.
Good luck minebro
Paid a lawyer $80 to make sure
Oh nicehash is not so nice anymore?I've been trying to find good information about nice hash, their calculator, which I'm not accepting to be accurate indicates .08821851 BTC a month per S9.Are you saying those numbers are indeed a poor estimate of profits?
I have 5 and make about $60 in BTC a day.
How much one miner cost?
