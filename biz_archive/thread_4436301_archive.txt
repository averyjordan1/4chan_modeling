Iâ€™m tired as fuck of the rat race.
I bought $20k USD in ETH yesterday and all I want to know is if I am going to make it or not.
you will if you are patient op
Madman!
i'm new to trading (never even traded crypto before) and ETH looks unstable AF!
I still think it'll work in your favour.
Good luck my man
ETH looks unstableit has been more stable than every other fucking coin.
It was balancing between 285 and 315 for months, just now there's a little moon going on.
Maybe you bought at the right time op.
Yeah that's a good investment.
BTC is now normie, ETH is second on the list.
>BTC hit 10k causing new interest>I'm a normie who wants BTC like inital gains, what is this on normiebase?
ETH and it's only 350 per coin!!!!!!!!!
I'm buying that.
you might have bought at the perfect time, it looks like ETH is going up in the coming months.at the very least you won't lose money.
80% of my networth is in ETH at $390 because I'm retarded so I sure hope so
how do you know?
i'm a newfag and i have 0 experience, i'm curious
actually youre right, i should stop reading normie articles crying about how unstable ETH is, im a newfag dont judge
with high risk comes high reward or high losses.. nobody can honestly answer your question..
It might all go up in smoke tomorrow
why the hell not link.eth goes 10x - $3,500/ethlink goes 10x - a whopping $1
