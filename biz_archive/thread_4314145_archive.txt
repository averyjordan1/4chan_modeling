TFW after you were on a caffeine delirium shorting bitcoin with 100x leverage all night and watched the screen until episodically the numbers on your screen didn't mean anything.
I made a small fortune for my standards and I think you could still do the same.
bitmex needs 1 confirmation and no verification.I lost about 2000 euros daytrading, fomoing and unpatiently selling and made back much more than that in one night.
I feel great and am gonna celebrate this now.
I know what you mean OP.
Sometimes you get in that zone where you see and process the numbers but they are nothing more than that.
Amounts lose value.
That can wreck you though, be careful.
That's my fantasy
Who is that?
