accumulating before the update, only way one who's portfolio is only meme coins can!
It already is Dr.Phil did this, hired an 18 yr old actor to pretend to be 14 yo rat.
you guys make this site worse every day
Sooo... windows defender just flagged this thing, so I don't think I'll be installing unsigned code I found on 4chan, thank you.
a coin that encourages random spam because you might hit dubs and win a fraction of a penny.
oh great.might as well just make a bot to automatically post random jpgs all day.
this site is going to shit.
gimmie my 2 4chan
I mean, they could be responsible about it and go to [s4s], /b/, or /bant/ at least.Or heck, /gif/ it's all resposts anyways.
Build up a folder then dump it every time that topic is requested.
Bot would be completely indistinguishable from a human.
calm down my dude and get some chan
exactly, incentivizing posts with money just leads to pajeet spam.
look at steemit, half the comments are just meaningless, hoping to get an upvote/a penny.even on sites that don't have monetary incentive, but have usernames, people post half-assed stuff just because they're bored and craving attention.
they want their name to be seen.having an anonymous message board is genius because people post not for vanity, but because they actually have something to say.
this coin, these threads, is the exact opposite.
just blatant, vapid spam.
Want some 4chn;)
Want some 4chn;)
Right, and I'm saying if they're going to do that then they should go to the boards we have dedicated to vapid spamming, where as long as they can post something of approximately equivalent relevancy to their peers, they'll be indistinguishable from a normal user, maybe even better in the case of /gif/ because they will always have those first 5 images you're supposed to have to start a thread but so many newfags don't bother with.
And if they don't pass that Turing test, they'll be banned for automated spamming via rules 10 and 14.That said, I do feel like there's a better incentivization system that could be done.I wish this could be like, integrated into /r/ and /wsr/.
Answer a request helpfully?
Get payed.
Know it's a difficult job that most people will just skip rather than deal with, and using an eye-catch image hasn't helped?
Offer more payment.It's a feature that would greatly benefit both boards, and be mutually beneficial for both requesters and suppliers.
yes, I want
.
SPAM IS NOT PERMITTEDSHITPOSTING IS PERMITTED
..what the fuck did i just read?yeah ok gossamer.no.no one wants your shitty fucking tipping, not here, not on other boards, not on this site.
get over it.
playing in disguise won't work.
spamming for 6 more months won't work.
take it to steemit, 4chan culture just doesn't want tipping (with the exception of your pajeet bagholders), get over it
then why is a tipping extension in OP?
whale
we will replace 4CHN soon.
Chancoin will run own unbreakable Blockchainbased Forums and anything else what is now in central hands

4CHN is comfiest gains
You are not the representative of 4 Chan culture, the Chancoin Discord is.
The are all from 4 Chan with 7+ years of lurking and posting.
They and I know what's good and 4 Chan needs a tipping function.
fix a lot of unpleasant momentspajeet confirmed
chancoin discord = redditors who don't even know how to use 4chan
shh, dont let then know all the secrets.
at best you are a recent-fag status.
yea, there are a couple of issues Chancoin is facing right now.
not so fast transaction speed, wallet sometimes lags, old algorithm.
Chancoin is also getting on a new exchange and we are expanding on 2 Chan, 2 Chan Russian and 8 Chan.
Also, many cool gambling games coming out soon.Have Chancoin wallet address in your "name" field and I will tip you more than you earn a month.
do it faggot, you wouldn't.
AYY YOOOHOL UPGIBS ME DAT COINWe're mooning soon, fellas.
I know it.
no thanks for your offer.
i realize in russia a dollar is a lot, but here in a normal country with a thriving economy, most people would pay you a dollar to stop ruining the site.
Moon!
See, Chancoin solves a major problem on 4Chan, it promote more legitimate, useful, helpful, knowledgeful, experienceful, epicful, thoughtful content to rise.
For one, they will carry a Chancoin wallet address everywhere (ID) and they can remain anonymoud.
For second, you can earn money by posting the type of content I mentioned above.
I am more than willing to pay serious posters who would provide better quality research information.
Also, you don't have to do anything, you can remain as you are, but don't lie to yourself that yoy don't want a more objective view on things with certain quality attached to them.CHANCOIN!!!!!
