How are you not getting in on this right now?
Modum has real world applications and is being used by 48 registrered companies.
some of us want to keep accumulating, so we aren't shilling it.
Some of us actually want to BE the whales one day.
I get what you're saying.
Just wanted other /biz bros to know about it.
Also I can't accumulate more than I already have.
cant buy more>lets shit on it so nobody else can enjoy ityou pajeet
This is an obvious moon, I don't even think that we need /biz/ on the board for this lol
moon when?
Please shut the fuck up about this for a few hours.
Need to transfer funds to binance.
Looks like rising wedge to me.
WTC on the other hand is a perfect bullish penant.
it could look like a lot of things on your stupid chart, regardless the marketcap is going to double this year at least
i mean no, don't buy this yet, wait for a little while guys you can probably get this wayyyyy cheaper
