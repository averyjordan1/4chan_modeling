What do you think about my portfolios guys?Beginner here... diversification too high?Considering to sell LTC or ETH and buy more REQ therefore
My only advice is put it all into one coin dude that is likely to do at least 50%.
You have to take big risks with that little money.
Trust me.
Best of luck to you.
Definitely getting justed today.
Most everything bought at the dip from 2 days ago.
I'm not touching anything until btc settles down, suggestions welcome though.
is right, going to have to actively trade or get a good moon to make itholding a lot of bags, I'd focus on btc and one other coin, move between the two and tether, or if you trust eth just go all in on that and hold
