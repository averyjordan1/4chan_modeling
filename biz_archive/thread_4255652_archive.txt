XLMStellar partnership with IBM's Hyperledger.
Affiliate members range over +300 Fortune 500 companies.
A Reddit AMA yesterday with IBM's CTO compared XLM to "real money, affecting real people", along with stating a variety of new partnerships and projects announcements to be unveiled VERY soon to early 2018.
A lot of great things in store for XLM.
Along with being insanely undervalued for the amount of volume it's going to see in the coming months.
Easily the best bet in all of crypto, next to bitcoin.1PCJY2HU6Hn8u4fjtyQnZLfj6UBx5f6bEP

This could keep happening for the next couple of years.
