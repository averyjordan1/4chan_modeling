Hey guys, I'm really interested in getting into Monero with some profits that I made.
I've looked over a lot of forums and stuff but no one seems to be doing price analysis on it.Is now a good time to buy?
no
why not?
prices in crypto aren't rational
well i bought at 100$ and personally not selling till $230....if it even does go down to $100 again its still good risk to reward
right now i'm 50% BTC and 50% MoneroIf Monero dips again (<$130) i'm going all in
Is now a good time to buy?Are you a daytrader or looking for medium to long term investments?
Not OP but actually considering for day trading
Not OP but actually considering for day tradingMonero is a really dumb choice for daytrading as it's market price tends to go horizontal for long stretches and then inch it's way up to a new floor.
Daytraders would be better served with more volatile coins like BTC and trying to time the rollercoaster.We long-term holders for Monero are going for the moon however so feel free to join us if you don't want to post pink wojacks after you lose money gambling on shitcoins.
I understand the potential in this coin so you don't need to shill me there; what price are we looking at over the next few years?Thinking of using my miners to accumulate while using other investments for non-minable crypto flipping.
what price are we looking at over the next few years?$500-$1000 would be my estimate for end-of-year 2018.
In the meantime, where could I multiply my money to be able to invest in this?
Trying to make a balanced account of quick trades and long holds
Pic too hot... can't formulate answer...
Anyone knows the source of the picture?
I can only find links to Chinese forums: https://www.jinghuasoft.com/smthview.jsp?board=Picture&id=1590872So, plot twist, OP is Chinese?
