If the flipenning akchually happens, what happens with the prices of both bch and btc?
BCH price will be whatever lil Jihan can manage to pimp out his worn out brown eye to the latest horny dock worker
Bitcoin drops significantly, while Bitcoin Cash will rise quickly.
This rise for Bitcoin Cash will be only temporary as it reaches 1:1 parity with BTC, then drop along with it as money panic exits the spaceCrypto Winter 2.0 begins and hopefully we can pick a new, better champion to be king of crypto
If it actually happened Jihan would on day 1 raise the BCH transaction fee to 17.5% the value transacted.
Why would he do that when he owns a shitload of bch.
Wouldn't be better for him to pump the price of bch instead of pumping the fees?
Just look at that nasty evil little chink.
Do you really think he's ever done the right thing for anyone other than himself?
The answer is never ever.
Is it not clear to anyone else that daddy and his big blocked twin are dying, and the new queen ETH with Prince XMR will reign supreme in perfect harmony?
They will care for our alts like no other.
Why not do both?
He could, it BTC was dead
People don't like the word "fees".
At the end of the day it would be the same since he would control the price (apparently).
