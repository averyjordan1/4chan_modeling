hell yeah dude
Fuck you i want to buy the dip below 8k
YEP!buy wall looking great on binance and building momentumFeels good to jerk off to jemma boys try it for yourselves!
Guys POWR is overpumped.
Stay off it, God damn it it's buy low sell high.
Stay poor faggot.80% of my gains this month comes from POWR
sorry what's ATH mean?
t. POWRless
All Time High
Right and that doesn't fucking strike you as odd?
Deluded fucks...
High all the time
Annual Tether Hustle
Time High All
New ATH will occur within a couple of days.
There are no brakes on this train.News of the India tech partnership is spreading (although this has been confirmed for a while), and anticipation about a Thai power company that has likely signed with Power Ledger.Do NOT try to time the market with this coin, you'll get burned.
It could easily go up 30-40% in an hour and not come down again.
This isn't your everyday shit coin, it's the real deal and there;s never been anything like it.twitter.com/lambolydia
Annihilating Tether Hooligans
Sold after I made some 20% profit from yesterday.
Gonna wait for another dump to buy in again.
What's a good target range?
was thinking 6.8k
tfw there won't be a "low" for quite a while
It's not going below 7k ever again, you'd be lucky catching at 7.8k
.00008452
it begins
I'm definitely aiming between that and 7.2, but might set a new floor above that.
Any "bag holders" from the last pump who wanted to get out probably have already.
we'll see :)
JESUS TAKE THE WHEEL
8600
it will dump
told you it would dump
LIFTOFF
smart man
99999nice
DEM DIGIT FUCK KEK HAS SPOKEN
>people still buy at/near ATHwhy do people do this to themselves

I'm so excited for the "it's over 9000" memes when the satoshi's hit
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

>tfw you bought at 30 cents
 2024> WTF I SOLD AT $.37 FOR $5K NOW IT WOULD BE WORTH $70000000000000 REEE
I sold now at 8834I think it'll dip a bit.
Will buy in again then
too late to get in?
Still ok to buy in now?
Or its over?
It's far from over, but it might correct itself a bit now before it keeps going up
shoulda sold at 9k like everyone else
I finally recovered all the money I lost from the chinks on Neo last week.
Thank you Mommy.
I guess, but better safe than sorry.
Burnt myself far too many times on missing the high
bought 2000 at 8100-8200, was moving fast as fuck
Yeah, im just going by candles here they look pretty solid
Please dip.
I just sold my REQs to getdo more POWR
I think I 8900 was the high for this push to be honest.
I think I did good.Now the question is where to buy in again
looks like a slight retraction and it'll fly upwards againrisky plays

lol this coin is never dropping below 8k
it's dumping a fair bit after each high.
only 10 btc to 9000, it's going to test it for sure
Yeah you're right...
The fees makes it practically not worth the risk.I'll stay inBought back at 8690
looks like this anon is correct - should be confirmed tomorrowhttps://twitter.com/hellenoreilly/status/932992406705729537
LETS GO MOMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

JUST FUCKIN HODL MAN ITS GONNA GET TO 10K EASILY THEN FUCKING FLY
if you have to ask this then obviously it's not
I WANTED TO CANCEL IT BUT IT HAPPENED SO FAST AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
that correction looks natural and healthy as fuckAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YES

I just want it to go horizontal for a long while now
RSI crossing nicely
yea a nice little refuel would be perfecthonestly it looks like it could head that way according to the candles
DUMP WHEN PLEASE GOD
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE UR CHANCE TO GET IN ON TE TRAIN UNLESS U BUY NOW NOW NOW
You'll be lucky to get in around 8700
I remember when it went from 3k to 3.5k and back to 3k someone here said "Jesus pumps only last 5 minutes these days" - hahaha look at that 1D chart
By the way my memeline prediction is pretty solid so far
sell walls getting tiiiiiiirrreeed
This coin is going to be top 15 on marketcap no doubt about it
apple and amazon and google are always at ATHpowr is god
>mfw missed out on making an extra $20k because i sold at 8k
HODL THAT SHIT BROyou don't daytrade GODCOIN
sure, but it can't keep going up forever.
I just wanna buy the dip :c
you can't correct australia, india, thailandmaybe papua new guineabut this shit is over.. maybe my 1 billion cap prediction for 2018 was way off2 bills?
it has to correct at some point anon
you can buy the dip at 15000 satsor you can buy fucking now and dollar cost average in like a real playah
Lets be crazy for a second.There's going to be what, 10 billion people on the planet in at least 10 years right?Imagine if half of those people have access to solar panels.
I knew buying at 30 burger cents was a good idea That $350 Is going to buy me a fucking house
It's testing the new resistance line.
If it breaks through it in a strong manner then idk, but if it keeps testing it, then it should dip back down to around 8400.
I got my bittrex account locked today out of the blue so all I can do is stare at my wallet balance.
Somehow I feel like this is a good thing since I probably woulda sold expecting a dump by now >:O FORCEHOLDstill salty that I found out it was locked by trying to buy 3k more at 78 tho
EASY $74 COIN
The next dip might be 1500. Who knows.
Seems to me that it's stabilising nicely as of this momentNo it doesn't if it keeps a low speed.
So it must slow down now and preferably go horisontal for a while.
i just went solar on a multi-family homeits getting too cheapwhen solarcoin hits $10 bucks we will see mass adoption as speeds we can't even fathom
Always Timing Hard
decent sell wall at 10k
Sold at 8600 and rebought at 9200.
I'M SORRY MOMMY I'LL NEVER SELL YOU AGAIN!
damn yeahmaybe sell at 9999 and put order in at 10001
sold at 90c and instantly moons to $1.05I'M SORRY MOMMA, I DIDN'T MEAN TO SELL YOU
 wait NEVER SELL GODCOIN
AHHHHHH EXIT EXIT EXIT
Now i'm pretty new to trading despite thinking i know a lot but I still don't understand the triggering of > ordersIf you put it at 9999 and order for 11000 does it wait until 11k to sell and then if it drops to 9999 sell immediately?
lol no.

There's great things to come for those who got in early.
This is going to be the best $350 I ever spent.
I'm going to continue buying dips over the coming months.
I'm already picking out the seat for my CVO Road Glide and the wallpaper for the house.
45007729k looks like the dip folks.8.7 if you're lucky.

Shitcoin.
You're just mad you missed your opportunity
Hear ye, hear ye!The Big Monies are comingGrab your wallet and musketWe are going to war>Tonight we feast on Whales!
It's not going to fly yet.
It's wedging between 9300 and 8700I think.. Not a TA expert
BTC is on the rise also
k
TECH MAHINDRA CONFIRMED.
FUAAAAAAARKMOOON here we go
Anyone buying now should prepare the wojaks
Are we all going to make it to lambo land?
Yes
ducking hope so man its been a rough few months
Dear god, please don’t stop going up
agreed
nah dog i bought an additional 350$ at 9k im not even worried
decent sell wall at 9500
he's gonna regret not reserving his room on the Moonbase.
Let hold these bags and watch profits soar high as a crow
OP hereso here's what i think is going to happen>RSI looks good>angle of rise looks sustainableWe're going to refuel at 9k and BLAST the fuck off towards 10k.
This coin will never be under 8500, at least for a long time.This coin is the real deal.
NoCoiner Wojacks when??
You're gonna see a lot of pink wojaks tomorrow and a whole lot of FUD
Time to dump lads.
you aint gettin my bags
Nah, in 24h this coin will be near 10k
i ain't selling till $40i learned my lesson with neo
I warned you :(
sold at 9000 hoping to buy back at 8500. dip plz
It's dipping.Not sure how far though.8800 now.
using coinspot atm so need big dip to be ahead on fees.... next buy in im shifting to bittrex
Sigh.I'll give you all ONE TIP and ONE TIP only.
HODL and when it drops BUY MORE to hodl.
Don't try to scalp, especially now since it doesn't seem to be dropping like it was the last couple of days.
the fomo is strong with this coinit might stabilize pretty quickly
using coinspot
I expect stabilisation at 8500, although I could be wrong.Same.
there are some supports candles at 8300
please dip more, i gotta get some
I hope you guys sold at k because this is crashing straight down to 7k againYou did sell right?
AHHHHHHHHHH
45011868600.
I am currently holding this coin since 5500. is this a long term hold?
Can I expect 10x or more in 2018?
7kLOL no
Yes.
Long term.I only sold at 9050 so I can jew in some free coin when I buy back.
Long term the value is there.
They are being bought instantly when they are sold.
You idiots.
Completely absorbed by the guys with lots of money who know the coin is going to skyrocket.
1m
I'm holding since 3100 and I'm not letting these go for a long time.
This is one of the first real "investments" you can make right now in crypto.
Going back up.
implying 1m isn't useful
10k, here we go!
gotit.
wake me up when its 8k again so i can go hoard my solar jew gold
Boom, back up to 9k
 I'm seeing glimpses of 9100 now.
Yeah I bought it originally at 3300 but I sold it because I was hopping on the neo train last week.
I should've acquired more tough but I think holding this coin is comfy and my goal is at least 10x
Yep all these people in this thread that just sold please kill yourself.
SELL IF WE ALL SELL NOW WE CAN BUY BACK AT 8KSELL YOU FUCKING FAGGOTS
These dips are literally only shaking off weak hands and the people trying to profit from dips are getting locked out.
I sure hope this breaks $100 soon
WEAK HANDED BITCHESI AINT AFRAID
I sold at 9050 and now have ~100 coins more than I did when I sold after rebuying at 8600.
faggot whale on binance needs to take his 12 BTC wall down at 9kFFS
so possible silly questionwhy doesnt the volume move on this coin?
It's a scam sell now before they exit aaaaaaaaaaaaah
Still early stage... big whales are still eating BTC.
sold and instantly regretted it.
Bought back in a few hours later with a loss of 40 powr.
FORGIVE ME SWEET MOMMA NEVER AGAIN.
SELL SELL SELL
The moon landing is so close I can taste the sick gainz
AHHHHHHHH I SOLD EVERYTHING AHHHHHthank you
why sell, the rocket is simply refueling
bittrex sux
Possible drop inc.
it might hit 8650ish but its gonna bounce up again.
Agreed.
they just want a dip, disregard them
looks like it's normalizing
is this the bottom of the dip boys?
% yes60% no
It's refueling.You'll see it hop between 8700 and 9100 for a little while.
no 7000 bottom of dip... maybe not for a day or two.
Its a good coin with good tech but super hyped up & inflated atm so surely has to come back to earth
buy at 88 sell at 91 making made gains I FUCKEN LOVE THIS COIN!!!
!Dumped my KORE coin bags and just have been making made gains with POWR.
THIS IS WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE A TRUE BLUE BATTLER IN THE CRYPTO SPACE
 realistically would be the lowest, but hard to say how the market will react.
Maybe panic drops to 8000, but it seems to stabilise better than most.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
went all in at .75can easily see this at a 1b cap soon
It's going to drop obviously, that's just what happensThis coin has too much going for it to actually drop far, though.
hopped on again at 8700 GOODBYE MONEY AND RATIONALITY
that's actually a great buy point
You're gonna get rekt hard
Nah if it keeps going up/staying the same in 20 minutes its blasting off to 9500+
gonna hold this bag till i die anyway
It's going to a dollar within a week.
Possibly soon depending on how heavy US trading is during the Thanksgiving holiday.Like I've been saying, don't try to time this coin.
You're going to get burned.
Hard.
It'll easily hit the billion dollar market cap
Ye bois this is the refuelling stationLOOK AT DEM CANDLES
IM CRYING BECAUSE 2 DAYS AGO I WANTED TO BUY IN AT 6600 BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS TOO HIGH AAAAAAAAAAH
It's still FAR from too high to buy in.
I repeat, never has a coin had such an obvious reason for billion+ market cap.
Get in now for an easy 5x gains at least.twitter.com/lambolydia
moon mission #2 incoming in 20 minutes

you didnt buy at0.120.50.70.9you will not buy at1.01.11.21.52.0Stay poor pajeets
I wanted to buy the 0.85 dip but it only went to 0.86 :C
if you're timing it, use market orders not limit orders
I feel almost nothing from this moon mission, been on too many at this point.
I'll feel something when it hits $1
4502231THIS10K sats within the next hour.
We will see 15K sats end of the day when Australia wakes up
But what if they dump when they wake up?
fucking pile of shit blockfolio shows 9220 when in fact it's 9600 on bittrex, why is this
Last time I went to bed after the ath it crashed bigly.
But fomo hits me hard again and I don't want to sell.
Please take care of the price while I sleep thanks.
its only midnight/11pm here m8i bet all the neckbeards who hold this shitcoin are already watching
why would they?
Nothing changed.
The team is constantly pushing out great news.
Even the newspapers are picking this shit up.Of course on the route to 1B MC there will be a few 'corrections', but we should still see a uptrend on the 'long'run
its sitting around 9200 on binance
yeah but I picked bittrex on blockfolio.
now it's stuck at 9220
10K in next half hour?
That's a bit too optimistic I think.
But sooner rather than later
To be honest when 1$ hit, its time to buy hard.
It can easily go to moon before it corrects.
If you dont want to bother follow the ups and downs, just hold and you will be there anyway.
Im a hodler myself, pajeet sell for 20$, im just drinking my beer enjoying the ride.
BIZ WAKE UP DRAGONSLAYER IS HAPPENING BITCOIN CASH UP FOR NO REASON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IT'S CRASHING AAAAAH
It won't break the support.This coin is on a steady/healthy track to 10k, from there 1$ should be simple.
That's the spirit.
Let's go.
>want to buy more>dont want to buy at athwill it ever go below 7k again, gals?
BUY DIP
I'm gonna buy some more.
this is a warning to sell right now
k no9k yes
FOMO-san, watashi wa.....
Looks like it still has a little bit more time to correct.
Is it dumping?
How far up do you guys think it might go today?
k in 24h easilyBut itll drop to at least 8700 imo
Keep on hodling all this time, or gamble and sell at 10k and rebuy at 8.8ish?
Well, according to history this train has no stop.
You might be lucky to pull it off but the stress might not be worth the minimal gain and potential losses
My tought exacly.
Feels like this god coin has no roof.
Surely it must hit the bus stop soon and crash down, maybe near the 1 Dollar mark if it even do go up that far?
Where the fuck is that guy Lain when you need him?
*Goes down 100 sats" UGHHH DUMPING, every fucking time, stop panacing unless you bought near ath.
Oh wait...
Yeah, you're gonna want to buy.
NEW ATH BOYS
What is the chance of this realistically becoming a $5 coin?What is a conservative price prediction for POWR in January 2018?I bought into this hoping to make my BCH losses back so I could regain my Link stack.
But thinking of maybe just keeping this instead it looks like a good coin.
$ coin this month?
Slim5$ coin in general?
Almost guaranteed
Jan 2018 probably $5, then a slower climb to $50 over the next year.
mr gorbachev tear down this wall
Yep.
It can go up to 50$ if they keep finding deals and stick to their roadmap, communicate etc.
exactly like they are doing right now
How much of a stack do you guys have?Almost 5k for me
Big sell walls up to 10k, nope.jpg
I can afford like 400 anon.Rest of my cash is in other nice projects.
A huge wall got torn down earlier.
Our mommy can do anything anon!
k here.
Actually transferring money in to pick up more.
First coin that actually gave me confidence in it like a real investment.
I daytraded with this for a bit.
Managed to accumulate a few extra POWR from selling high and buying low, but not much.
Definitely not worth the stress or the risk.
So I stopped with it.
Now I'm comfortably holding
This.The coin looks good.
I am considering selling some other coins and putting more in this one.
Trading this.
I got out and instead of buying the dip I bought like I wanted to I bought BCash and lost all my profits.I'm sorry.
It's okay anon.
Mommy will forgive us for our sins and make everything all better.
just gotta believe manset your stop losses before bed and just let it rise
45036789900!!!!!!
Goddamn its gonna sell out anons!
i'm really getting worried about a retraction now lads sure it's gota be time to sell soon this growth is too much
Seriously, I think I'm just gonna gonna stick w/ listening to the 30 min candles and MAYBE follow 15 minute for intradday trading.1-10 is just wasting my time.
Took profits at 9800 sats.
only 1.7k, this is after me going all-infeels sad that I can't invest more, but, well, you gotta start somewhere
It's "retracted" multiple timesif you get in at a good price you'll be just fine
yeah fuck this im out, the dump off is going to be fucking insane
I bailed at 9500
well of course i'm not expecting to lose money the dilemma is whether it's worth selling and buying on retraction for even more or if will make less money than holding thorugh it
k!!!!!!!!!!!!!

>tfw just sold at 10k>it keeps mooningNO NO NO FUCK I WANT BACK IN FUCK I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA DUMP DOWN TO 9k AGAIN FUCK
I DONT WANT TO SLEEP
tfw sold half at 8k last night expecting a slight dump to buy back in.
LMFAO IM HOLDING THIS COIN FOREVER
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHA we did it.
Lets moon from now on.
Pajeet dont fucking sell.

The buy side is insane, hardly anyone selling on binance

GO GO GO!
goddamn lucky mofos who sold at 10k can buy back in at 9k now
Hold to 50 bucksfixed
>tfw been waiting to buy the dip since 7k
FUCK OFF PAJEET WE'RE FULL
Are we looking at the same chart?
REEEEEE
Nah son we're all looking at the BTC pair
yeah it's pretty annoying seeing btc sat prices in every thread, switch to eth niggers it's better in every way than dinosaur coin
 not using more stable coin to trade
And dont trade based on orders lol wtf xD

>the one coin I didn't buy despite watching it since it came to binance because i thought it was overvalued and wouldnt deliver for years>knew about the ico and considered participating but gave up at the last minute>all my coins are deep in the red>lost 1k on confidoI must be cursed.
Trend is based on BTC, ETH is just for arbitrage
Just smashed 10k.
WHAT HAVE I BEEN SAYING.twitter.com/lambolydia
eh I don't really consider buy orders at 10% of current price a "buy wall"
TA > FAfor short term gains.
I don't actually know or care what this coin does apparently one of the devs or founders is a milf?
Dumping INC?
Yes its a milf and she is the deputy mayor of Perth.
She pre tested Power Ledger pre ico in her city and it was a success btw.
WHAT IS GOING ON
Dumping at 13k bois, then rebuying at 10k5 moving way above in a slow slope.
JUST TANK ALREADY
> it keeps going
1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon 1$ soon
I don't fucking know man, I sold a little bit after after 10k to rebuy.I'm not gonna FOMO over it.
Either I can actually stick to longer term candles or just be happy that I can scalp some profit.
Much more important long term than losing money due to FOMO.
~100btc of buy and we are there HAHHHAHAHA
>hold for hours waiting for 10k>didn't think I'd sell>thought it would dump at 9.999 something>it zooms past for the moon mission without mePLEASE GO BACK DOWN
Its not a FOMO.
The coin has real value for long terme gains.
Look by yourself pajeet.
Only holder make real profit, its proven by history
k IS GONNA FUCKING HAPPEN TODAY
It's alright dudes, as long as I don't buy in it will literally keep going upEnjoy your infinite gains
Over the span of years for index funds.Look at Link
>try to swing trade>immediately FOMO back in at a higher priceFFFUUUCK don't be stupid like me anons lost 70 PWR on that
Look at the depth chart holy shit.
It's pretty justified tho, there is a lot going for this project.
This isn't going to dump like the typical pump and dump.
Nah brah.
I bought in at 77cents and it keeps going.
If i bought in and it keeps going, you should too
>tfw sold at 8300 todaykill me please
feel your pain brother
Dont worry it will dump down to 2k soon
1$ today?
WE'RE GOING FUCKING PARABOLICWHEN WILL IT STOP?????
MOMMMMYYY AAAAAAAAAAAA

>tfw Aussie and have to go to work tomorrow and my Aussie coon is mooning at fucking 2:40 in the morningJUST FUCKING DIP SO I CAN BUY BACK IN FUUUUUUCKFUCKING AMERICANS STOP FUCKING PUMPING THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU FUCKSTHIS IS OUR COIN
I think it’s FINALLY losing steam.
Although I wish it would keep going.
oh no worries it will go back up, just let it go back down some so we can accumulate more
buy NOWyou'll see 50% gains when you wake up
Pal, next stop will be 15k.. so buy now
FUck work cunt day off I just made so much on this shit.Only bought it cos chick was a MILF and coin was the only Aus one I'd heard of.Fuck me dead
if we drop below 10k i'm bailing and looking for retrace buy this growth is just too much for me to risk losing the profit
I'm not buying at ATH.I sold my stack at 10k and waiting for a little dip below 10k to buy back in.
>fuck workNah I need to get back my Link stack mate.
I've given up on day trading.
Gotta get that Fiat.
I only sold because I legit thought it would dump at 10k fuck me dead.
some pajeets are selling but if you look at the chart its still holding.
it will go higher for sure
Yes..yes dip more
Sell?
buy now if you wanna enter.
pajeets are soon gone, it will rise i believe.
it s just a consolidating phase right now
goddammit I couldve increased my stack by 5% instead of losing 5% if I waited 5 minutesfuck FOMO
up again
calling it now.
15k
the consolidating phase will be soon over and we are going to the moon.
sell at 13k or 15k.
rebuy after the correction
MOONING AGAIN FAGGOTS
*wipes brow* phew almost sold there as we approached 10k please no dead cat bounce
I'm holding til $5 dawg.
STRAP IN LADS AND DRINK YER JUICE WE ARE LAUNCHING AGAIN
hold this shit and it will go 2$ today.
but i know you pajeets want some small gains now :/
Is this even going to dip?
I have no idea what good price would be right now to buy and hold.
Just decided any price is good fuck swing trading on this one
this is skyrocketingbelow 11k everything is good so buy
I feel like 2$ EOY is completely reaslistic right now.
There's so much fate in this that it is not going back.
way to go.
10'800 is your entry but i dont know if it will not jump before.
11k and you sell 13k is safe, depending on your market
Finally the dip is incomming.
TA dont mean shit
It's gonna have to refuel sometime.
Every time it refueled to this point has only been a +/-800 change
4504899Fuck it, I'm just holding.
There's no way this isn't reaching at least 1$ in next few days and then 2$+.
I'm in at 6477 im not budging
I was in at 58c and 52c and flipped for some profit..
However, what I'm seeing now is just insanity.
There is too much faith in this, it's going to 2$.
I regret selling 20% of my stack for weak profits lmao
