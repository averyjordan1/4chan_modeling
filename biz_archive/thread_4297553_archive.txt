Tell me how does /biz/ actually lose money in crypto?
From my perspective it is very difficult if you aren't retarded considering that I will lose money on 9 trades for about -5% profits and make at least 2-10x profits on the 10th trade.
Who can honestly say they've lost a significant amount of money on a trade without being retarded or emotional in the process.
buy high sell low
>know fuck all about the market>see a coin that's green>buy it>it goes down a day later>sell itisn't that obvious?
exaclty that's a good example of how to lose money being retarded.
I'd like to hear how people have lost money by not acting like mongoloids.
just time the market broalso losing 5% on 9/10 times is 45% losses.
whats your gain on btc?
>there are people on this board who bought BCH at ath
>"Hmmm I wonder what coin I should buy">"Oh look this coin is being shilled on /biz/">"WOOoooo such a huge increase in such a short time, better get in on this instead of missing out again">buy at ath>sell at a significantly lower price when you've finally lost all hope of the price recovering any time soonThis is exactly what's happening with BCH
Basically they were conditioned by the huge bull run earlier this year to play fast and hard They pull out fast if things go south instead of just being patient because they expect every coin to go x3-x5 instantly
Try this shit in a downward marketEverybody thinks they're hot shit when the price just goes up for a few months.
idk about you but so far i'm making good profit.
Holding for the long run and only investing in coins that I believe have a good future.
Turned 75 to 300 back in april and over the past few days made 120
