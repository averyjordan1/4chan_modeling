'Neo mining-', shut the fuck up boy.
Looking to sell a significant portion of my Neo before the announcements on Monday.
Right now every pajeet and their mother is under the impression that a partnership with the Chinese government is certain.
If this is not true on Monday, any other announcement, no matter how good, will cause the price to dump significantly.
Our money is hedging on a huge gamble right now, it's not even investing anymore.
NEO CAN'T BE MINED YOU RETARD
>- China will ban Bitcoin MiningOh, he's retarded.
