Anyone here boycott uber/lyft out of principal?
Also anyone here ever driven for them?
How was it *like*?I hear people claiming they make $800 a week driving, which I belive is complete utter bullshit.
Especially when you calculate gas, time wasted in traffic and wear-tear on your car at the end of the dayDon't get me wrong I hate the pajeets/akmeds in the conventional Taxi but they do have a point nearly all of the risk is on the drivers for rideshares.In any case I would belive that uber pays less than min wage at 40hr week avg.
You don’t have to pay tax until you cash out :3
You forgot it's 1099 contractor work too.
Most people driving for them are living paycheck to paycheck and blowing all their money on weed and beer.
Slap in the face at tax time when you have to pay 30% or whatever of your yearly earnings and you've got $500 saved for rent
I drive rideshare.
In Seattle higher market rate then most.
I do $500-$700 weekend nights only.Example drove 3 nights last week did $800 , driove about 400 Miles.
Must have access to multiple platforms not that shitty X only stuff, So I do Xl/Plus
You mean "principle"
Forgot to add the chicks hitting on you is a nice plus... even for an old married guy like me.
Were they asian?
Actually last weekend one was telling me how handsome I was.
The other chick asked me if my dick was hard with her telling me shit.But all honesty I’ve been doing this shit part time 2 years very profitable.
If you have any questions I’m all ears.Best tipsYour market must not pay shit ratesAcceptance rate does not matter, meaning you only take rides very close to you or drive to those rides that may be likely profitable.
