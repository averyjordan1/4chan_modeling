Hello.
I have for sale 484 units of women's trousers breeches.
Materials: viscose / elastane.
Made by Asos.
For 242 each color: 242 black trousers, 242 black trousers in a white polka-dot.
All this lies in my warehouse in Cambridgeshire, but I am Russian with Russian citizenship, I live in Russia and use the services of Alfaparsel, which slightly complicates the task.

However, the delivery and packaging are completely up to you.
The goods are sold "as is", these are absolutely untouched packages with Asos.
You will have to collect everything from the warehouse at11, Gold Leaf Industrial Park, Sandall Rd, Wisbech PE13 2GAAnd I'm Russian with bad English, so it would be highly desirable if you contacted me through a person who knows Russian))For contacts - %%barieff2009@gmail.com%%
