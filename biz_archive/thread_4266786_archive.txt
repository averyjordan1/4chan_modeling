ALT THREAD.
What ALTS are we going to see in the mainstream in a few years?
LINK and REQ, BTC, some forked BTC shit probably and maybe moneroOh and ETP of course.
LTC guaranteed
Lol bullshit.
Ones that will have actual use: Syscoin decentralized web-based market is up.
Its amazon/silk road where you can pay with btc zcash or sys.
Companies backing sys will unload 1 million + items when web comes out and marketingcampaign started.Florin project Alexandria is up next year.
Digital goods traded there.Xrp next year lots of banks will be using it.Maybe Bat but dont know development speed and if its really that useful.
Other icos definitely not in use in 2018.
There really are not a lot of coins that go mainstream in use.
Underdog ClearPoll for sure
Omg.
They already have a operating business behind them.
LTC is the poor man's BTC.
