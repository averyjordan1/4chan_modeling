Anyone who has any money to potentially spend on this will see what it really is when they go to the exchange.
You're wasting your time trying to shill this and you're not even doing a good job at it.

Clearly, sustained low sub 37k satoshi implies certain uncertainty about Ark's future, low risk premiums imply higher prices among other much better earning assets.
We can clearly see this materialize when taking into account the inverse relationship exhibited by the btc/ark ratios and the rate of shilling in the past and even in todayâ€™s present timeline.
But how do we know when delusion, irrational exuberance and shilling has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as played out with Ark over the past 6 months?
Ark here, will I make it?
You fucking better.
