Fuck the moon.TO INFINITY, AND BEYOND!!!!!!!!
See you at the top.
Amen brother, the real bitcoin has finally come to claim its rightful place
4309641hold it brothers were not even half way donethis shit is going off big time its like the rise of BTC but compressed into a few days
btc goes below 6k, bch goes over 2k... i think i have to fap guys my balls cant stand the pressure
is this a good thing?I feel like this is going to scare everyone away from crypto.
it's a death blow to all cryptos if it were to continue, but they will soon cash out bch profits
So I sold my BCC and am holding in Tether, made 2k profits and I am out.
BTC is what most exchanges use, along with trading with alt coins.
BCC will not sustain itself.
am holding tetheroh no, its retarded
4311207lol what are you talking about bch IS bitcointhey will call bch bitcoin after the flippening and call the old one bitcoin corenormies wont even notice the difference and all miners know whats going on.Besides most people where scared off due to the fact that people thought the big money making time is over, now they see it can happen again any time.
This is will become a huge fucking boost for crypto.
Especially with the big bang theory episode about bitcoin waiting around the corner flushing more normie money into it than ever before.
Its a great time to invest into crypto right now.
Just made some sweet inter-exchange arbitrage buying BCC with USDT, selling BCC for BTC, and then selling BTC back into USDTseriously though, this is all totally abnormal.
Its a giant fomo circle jerk and if you can hang on, good for you but I am 99% in tether
YES I got out just in time.
its correcting now
