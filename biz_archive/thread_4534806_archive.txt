You guys didn’t tell me I couldn’t cash out all this money I’ve made with with crypto currency
That's weird?
I cashed out 400k post ethereum pump in summer.
No issue.
Tfw bought nice apartment, tesla and now going to travel the world whilst managing my money that's still in crypto investments.
Stay poor, kiddo.
Anon how did you cash out?All at once on Coinbase?
Localbitcoin?
