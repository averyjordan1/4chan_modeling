Lol who did dis
So many Link threads.
Why?
Why is everyone so focused on a coin that has been in the gutter for so long?

Because they’re too deeply invested in it.
They can’t let go, even though no one else wants the coin, at least according to the price and trading volume

LINK fud posts are just the best.

Don't.
That's what fudders want to read.

Just memeing brah, I honestly like the FUD because right now I'm holding other short term coins and by the start of next year, I wanna hold as much REQ and LINK as possible.
You're not good at following your own advice.
Why would you hold coins with plans that take years and miss out on all these trades
please stop these memes are really hurtful and are making me binge eat :(
