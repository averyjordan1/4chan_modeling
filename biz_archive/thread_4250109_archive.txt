Explains why the meme lines of the h&s went in the opposite way or admit once for all that TA in crypto isn’t applicable and you can only trust FA.
Zoom out you fucking bitch
i dont know if it was you anon, but I explicitly told the anon who posted a head and shoulders chart a few days ago that because HE saw the h&s, the pattern would REJECT because he was a failure in life and never succeeded at anything, therefore he would fail hereBetting against 4chan wins yet AGAINI suppose this is kinda fundamental analysis
So, it went good so we zoom out , if it crashed “yeah h&s totally worked”.So whatever the fuck is my mood when I woke up I decide .
The old trick “do the opposite of what /biz/ does”
I'm sorry that you suck at TA.Read Edwards & Magee and you might learn something.
Will be my next reading, I know the post was most likely>learn the basics before shitposting about TA, you dense retardBUT you still earned a thank you.
of fucking course TA is not gonna predict some announcement made on a mailing list at a random timewhat the fuck did you expect
Yeah, sorry.
I missed the item of the 'Fork not fucken happening' in Bitcoin's Notes to the Balance Sheet.
Do you realize that 95% of the crypto world doesn't even know the fork has been called off?
