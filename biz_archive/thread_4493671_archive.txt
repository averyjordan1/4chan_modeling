do you want to get into crypto as a hodler or a day trader?
First you are going to need these
you see you share crypto "addresses with strangers" so you can meet up with them at the mall and solve puzzles together.
once the puzzle is solved you frame it and send it to toys r us which, after a few weeks, sends you a gift certificate for about 5 dollars which you must split with your new friend
Buy KNEEPADs
