Amen frogposter
I did that after losing 40% of my net worth gambling shitcoins.
I'm thinking about just fucking off crypto and starting to produce porn

Never, I'm going to trade till I either hit a million or lose all I have in crypto now...probably will be the latter tho
Oh rearrryy?
I am kicking myself for not selling everything right after s2x was canceled.
I am already so tired of this artificial fuckery.
I am thinking about fucking off from this crypto shit for at least some weeks to months and wait for better investment opportunities.

It is just pure gambling.
I am desu.
I want my vacation.
But really, I could be studying and working on acquiring a more stable means of income instead of lying awake at night in wait for some filthy rich people manipulating the markets.
