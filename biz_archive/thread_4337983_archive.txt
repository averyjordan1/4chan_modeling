Remind me again why bitcoin is king.
Serious question.My thoughts:Ecosystem built around bitcoin (more exchanges, atms, etc)Liquidity (I guess it is more liquid..)What else?
I really think btc deserves to die.
Ethereum should be king.
Even tho money skelli is a bank shill.
Bitcoin loyalist here, bitcoin is never wrong.
It is irrationally the king.
Doubt it and lose your money.
Enjoy being poor!
Why are you proving my point?
You guys are gonna follow btc off a bridge.
Drink more koolaid zombie.
Best coin is clearly eth.
yeah look at how the btc network handled the last 72 hours, and people actually think this shit is gunna scale.
Not difficult to see why BCC will win in long run.
God damn, clean your fucking status bar.
Disgusting.
It's still shit retard.
Slow and expensive to send around.
Sounds great >_>
Simply, because it's Bitcoin.
It is the only crypto out there that is truly censorship resistant.
Boom, there.
You people really are uneducated as fuck.
Educate us then.
Tbqh, I want to sell all my bitcoin.
The only reason I hold it is because I can count on irrational normies buying it.
>Soon to be 2000 + 18>Haven't taken the skelli pill yetYou are gonna go to 0 with bitcoin.
this should be picking up soon....
I am just surprised that people are not realising the value of this technology!!!
it is the fuel of crypto.......
ITS OVER RETARD
