Who else here getting absolutely fucking JUSTED?
What coin
I won 0.15 btc thanks to bchI hope they were yours kek
BANCOR IS UNSTOPPABLE OOOH AHH
I’m down 60k, about 40%.
I don’t know what to do.
I tried to make some moves to stop the bleeding and made it way worse.
Please tell me it’s going through be ok
all in on bch and you'll be up 40% end of day.
Its going to break 0.25 in two hours.Screencap this and send donation when it happend :)

Actual advice: if youre in panic and cant rationally look at the charts right now, just go to FIAT.Seriously, wait for the storm to clear, collect your thoughts, invest in a coin which you trust and you'll regain some of your losses.BCH is highrisk high reward atm, but as I said.
Wait it out for a least a few days.I recommend ETH, it's still #2 and pretty darn stable relativily speaking in the midst of this madness.
Goodluck anon.
Why fiat, and not tether?
This is literally my day 1 on /biz/ and have nothing invested in crypto.
While the hysteria may be entertaining, it's making me reconsider my idea to start doing so.
But I think I'm gonna wait and see who gets justed the hardest and base my buying decisions on that.
I lost 20k because of the BCH nonsense
BCH is highrisk high reward atmNot with that volume lmao, maybe in a few days when korea gets tired
fiat / tether, whatever same in my mind.
Thanks anon.
I’m still up on the week cause made some good gains with powr and nuls so it’s not that bad I guess.
Buy high sell low
no one said this
REQ, LINK and RCN are already on the launch pad.
If you want to dig in for your first time, hold a few stacks of each of these.
But always do your research; researching these coins will be a good first time
