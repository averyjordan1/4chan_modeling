GENESIS VISION GVTExtremely low market cap.
I heard about this project months ago and there was a lot of hype prior to ICO.
I thought it would sell out quickly and I didn't want to take part in it.
When I found out a week ago that it raised a little more than 2 million$ I couldn't believe it.
Later I found out that they had a little problems with marketing and then after a first week or two they said that they have enough funds to build what they need, and they are going to earn money by making their app extremely profitable for both them and investors.It passed U.S. Howey Test and it was available for US investors.
Team is extremely professional, they went through all legal reviews and they have hired 2 companies just to make sure their smart contracts were safe.
It means they are being transparent and honest about their project and not just looking to grab quick cash.Less than 3 million market cap.
Absolutely insane... the only reason it went so unnoticed was because ICO was happening during Bitcoin fork mania.It is currently only on EtherDelta (which means you can probably pick it up before it goes absolutely insane),have approval from HitBTC (will be listed from November 16 3:00 pm UTC) and continue negotiations with the number of exchanges (Bittrex and Binance).Charlie Shrem is working closely with team along with some other recognizable names from crypto world(Lykke team is working with them as well) and CEO and founder of Changelly.Exchanges aren't going to be problem.
Their closest advisors are all exchange owners so I really doubt they are going to have any trouble getting anywhere they want.
This is extremely important for price.

How the hell didn't I know about this?
Still not far from ICO price.
I'm tired of missing these gems, how can I see when EtherDelta adds a new token?
Their Twitter didn't list GVT yet.
