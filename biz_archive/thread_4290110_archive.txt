Shorting is selling with the intent of buying lower.
Prove me wrong faggot.
Protip: you can't.
That bait was literally genius.
You have to be a mastermind to think of that.
Absolutely incredible, that thread is required reading
You said it, with the intent (or obligation) to buy later.
So it isn't selling.

that one op that posted a ITT: Historic /biz/ moments moments after the previous one endedcunt
Nah.
But he made a few threads a day about it for months.
There was some occasional crypto on biz in 2016.
Itâ€™s how I got into crypto when monero was shilled here.
that one guy who had 3K BTC and posted nude of Paragon CEOWhat shit was wonderful
I started coming here regularly in January 2017.
The vast majority of what was posted here was genuine business & finance discussion with a handful of crypto threads.
The crypto threads weren't total cancer though.
They were for coins like ethereum, monero and bitcoin.
No one would have even dreamed of posting a thread for the latest shitcoin because they knew no one would care and dismiss it instantly.
I miss the stock discussion, now I have to go to wallstreetbets for that which is a shame.

/biz/ has been flooded with potcoin-tier p&d coins since its inception.
If you ever observed otherwise, it was an anomaly, not the norm.
I was the one who saved it for banner season.
Great thread
