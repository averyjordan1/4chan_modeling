Never because it's a vaporware scam
350 billion market cap, you're off your fucking rockerTotal shitcoin
How are you that bad at math.
It's astonishing.
Pajeet detected lmao
lol these are the types of people who don't own LINK
I'm pretty drunk
No LINKers confirmed alcoholic losers
Itâ€™s actually 35 trillion,000,000 link(100)Total max supply of 1 billion link though.Deluded linkies
I'm an alcoholic winner
Sorry I missed a fucking zero.
You're delusional if you think link will hit 100.I bought a couple btc worth night before last because I can see a pump coming.
Still a shitcoin with no potential other than short term gains.
You mean how many years before ChainLink hits the same market cap as Bitcoin has now?
HAHA
What the fuck is up with these constant retarded Chainlink price prediction threads?
You guys are proboly the same folks who said siacoin would hit a buck.
You have to look at total and circulating supply in regards to price.
Faggots detected
at $100 per LINK the total market cap would be $100 BILLION because there will be 1 billion coins releasedLOL GLHF
No.
>tfw you only have 200 link and even if it hits $10 that's just $2000>tfw when poor still poor
Nope
Look I'm not going to argue with you.
There is no point.
So I'm going to assume you genuinely believe the things you are saying.All I want you to do is remember this post and this moment.Remember you willfully chose your course of action and that you have nobody to blame but yourself.
You chose not to invest.
Nobody stopped you from doing it.
It's all on your shoulders.
correct me if I'm wrong but I believe smart contracts could in future be used for derivatives and other financial shitif chain link is a part of this 100billion wouldn't be a big dealpic related m8
Drunkie, you don't even have 1btc
Ask yourselves the questions why the whales would get more Link.
Like these addresses:https://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x7cbbf0a59fc47d864a1515af2ab62d207aa3320dhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca?a=0x6c47dab9b9416904aa8b73ee2c640ce694910ac3
In addition, the circulating supply will be a lot lower than the amount of tokens available.
Think of Bitcoin, the price is so high, because a large percentages of the bitcoins are not in circulation.If they came into circulation, the price of bitcoin would plummet.
Same applies for LINK, the market cap evaluation is indirectly based upon how much there is in circulation, not the total amount.
