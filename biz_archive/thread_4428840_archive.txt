Invested 900 euros a month ago and I'm 70 euros up right now.
I made it /biz/good feels thread
know these feels mane.
up 50 here on a 500 investment.
What did you buy?
All in on mod
Steady in since august on BTC and bought more up to now across Ark, VTC, NEO, ETH, XMR, MOD, OMG.
£2400 total.
Now at over £3700.
Hodling though
 euros up from 1000 euros three months ago.I hope by 2019 i'll have build up enough capital to be able to draw at least 100 euros per day, it would make me so happy.I calculated what i need to just live, and it's just like 5 euros per day, so i guess i already made it.
kek, just wait until another China bans crypto announcement happens and you enter a bear market for over a month while being at a loss.
your crypto asshole is still virgin
Kek.
Now I need to learn how to make more instead of hodling.
I want all of you(us) to make it.
Sounds dumb but thats how i feel.
Up 24k from a 15k investment since May.Could be way more but I listened to biz so lost a bunch of money too...
lmao there are people who unironically think crypto can go bear, evertheres no fucking way to lose trading these tokens
were you braindead for the past 2 months or are you just trolling me?
you only lose if you sell sure but some will be made permanant bagholders
Nice job mayng
