It's a Monero fork.

Yeah I think the 300-400 range was absolute floor.
I bought a shit ton at 51 sats back in March so it's been all gravy for me although i sold a lot on the various runs up and have just under 100k left now.
Still believe in the project and think it could easily get back to 1000 sats or more.
I've seen no more than a handful of threads come up on biz over the months and they rarely get 10 or more posts.
Not sure why biz is allergic to quality coins.
In the meantime I'm just staking my 3 MN's and biding my time.
Hell even a run up to $1 wouldn't even get it in the top 100.
I think there's tons of room to grow.
Same.

We're all gonna make it senpaiAlso for purposes of the thread I'm holding 550k SFC (solarflarecoin), was a defunct project with like 25k mcap but they've just recently unlocked their existing btctalk thread, updated the website and added a twitter account.
Not sure what that means but hopefully there's some progression on the coin and at such low values all it would take is a sliver of incremental buyers to get this thing up 4-5x.
Long hold for those willing to take the risk but my avg cost now is 36 sats so I'm willing to wait.
