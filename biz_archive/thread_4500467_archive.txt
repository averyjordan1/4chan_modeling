Have 100 dollars from my birthday.2.
Hand out 100 rubberbands and say they equal 1 dollar each because I have 100 dollars in my pocket.
Tell my retarded friends the rubber bands are "backed" but can't be redeemed for dollars.
They are free to trade them amongst themselves or for people who will accept them for pokemon cards.3.
Use the $100 I had in the bank to buy 100 jigglypuff pokemon cards for $1 each.4.
Make jigglypuffs more rare at my school, people see that jigglypuffs are demanded.
They buy jigglypuff cards and drive the average price up to $2.
Kids getting excited screaming that evil centralized lunch ladies have ruled to long, we will be freed by the soft songs of our pink savior.5.
I now have 100 jigglypuff cards and they are selling for $2.
Ask Mom to do math for me.
She says I now have $200 worth of assets and can now issue more rubber bands.
Tell my retarded friends that I am issuing more bands but they are 100% backed.6.
Issue 100 more rubber bands because they are backed by my store of value, jigglies.
Use collected money to buy more jigglies.7.
People start to buy my rubber bands and are easier to transport from place to place.
Coins and dollars get lost easier.8.
School bullies start to yell that rubberbands are worth nothing and my supporters yell back "but he's got the jigglies!
the rubber is backed!".
