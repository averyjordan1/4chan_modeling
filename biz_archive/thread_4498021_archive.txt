>*quietly appreciates in value*
this piece of shit literally needs to 5 x for me to even cut even
What the fuck?
At what price did you buy?
at 80 k sats...i'm talking in terms of btc of course not fiat.
Ouch
It will get back there.
This coin is VC backed and a solid long term hold.
Even won the Peter Thiel award for innovation.
It's no shit coin.
