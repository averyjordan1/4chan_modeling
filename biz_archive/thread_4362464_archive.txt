Get some on Mercatox before FOMO kicks in.
Crazy it was being shilled here and now blast off!

I wouldn't want to hold this coin very long.
Sure, it's not a long term hold but the big pump hasn't happened yet.
If you want to be safe buy now and sell for a guaranteed x2.
If you're not a pussy, stick around for the potential x3 - x5.
I'm suck bagholding litecoin gold.
Fuck you guys
the type of thing that would be highly illegal in any other market
Be thankful this kind of thing is legal, easiest money in the world.Sorry but if you "baghold" one of these types of coins you only have yourself to blame, it's always really obvious when they die and you should sell.
The only reason to baghold something is if you think it might go back up.You can make back that money if you buy some NEOG now, just don't get greedy.
NEO Gold, an ETH token.
A literal pump and dump piece of garbage.
They didn't even make it from NEO.
It's an erc20 version of NEO that gives holders petrol (GAS).
It' might be a very useful shitcoin and there you have it biz!
This is pretty much your last chance to get on guys, any entry point below 1000 sats is ok but after than you're in rocky territory.
Biz is gonna stay broke
