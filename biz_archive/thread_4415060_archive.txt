Because you're literally too retarded to do simple math and your numbers are WAY off, how could you expect to trade successfully everyday?
Its really hard to even make as much as you lose.
They aren't off.
assuming you never make a bad trade> every loss makes each gain that much harderyou are fighting against the spread/fees so you have to be more right than wrong for this to work - there is a reason that only ~10% of traders are successful.
It would.

make a measly 1% a day for a yearYou act like this is an easy feat.
You'd literally be the best investor on earth with that record.You'd need to make 3,678% in your first year.
Everyone gets this idea and somehow, everyone isn't rich from the markets.
what if I do stock then?
It would cut it down to 252 days a year, but that's still around $121,000.
>get taxed on every trade.
Taxes, fees, etc.You must understand that if you are right 50% of times you still lose, 'cause the game is rigged against you.
As your position gets larger and larger you won't be able to make your 1% due to liquidity.
Getting taxed on every trade is the same as getting taxed when you convert to fiat.
You aren't getting double taxed so it is the same.
