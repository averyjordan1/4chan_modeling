Elon Musk is fucking Johnny Depps ex wife.
Why would he want this ugly roaste
Elon Musk should have two wives, one as a trophy wife that he keeps like a pet, and the other one like in the OP who is maybe moderately attractive but incredibly smart and driven who can actually be a worthwhile companion for a man who shapes the world to his own designsOne would be getting everything for free and the other would have earned respect.
You're thinking of what's commonly referred to as a mistress.
The modern Anne Frank.
no no no anon, the only complaint should be>YidBtw I dont quite understand how powerledger is going to transmit the energy if they dont own the infrastructure.
Im also curious as to how theyre going to sell the destruction of the thousands of offices that handle payments and whatnot.

Elon Musk is fucking Johnny Depps ex wife.Nah, she started talking about marriage in the press and he dumped her.
Maybe he learned his lesson and won't marry again.
Good CEOs can't have good marriages -- they're too busy with work.
Elon is a hero world needs, but not the one it deserves.
