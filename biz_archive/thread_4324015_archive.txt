>BTC is recovering!>Now is the time to buy the BTC dip?Hmm.
Who could be behind these posts?
Don't buy now.
It's still going down real fucking steady.
This downward slope could continue for a long time with all the BTC holders who lost confidence in the coin after the BCH incident.
>drawing a redline on a chart
What the fuck even is this redline?Overall the market sentiment seems that on average people believe it's going to reach at least $8000, and are most willing to buy it at $5000.
Sorry Dr. Autism, should I have made it black or purple?
It's a peak-based line.
Look at it compared to the peak/spikes.
These can be more accurate than doing a median or average slope.
