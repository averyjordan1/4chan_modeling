Anyone else absolutely filling their boots in Link's mega sale?
I'm waiting for at least 40% more dip.
Then I'll think about it again.
Link has been on mega sale for over a month now
Going to .13 during the weekend, upping my stack to 25k if it does
its going under .10I'm figuring about 4 cents 2018 Q1Then hovering 1-2 cents Q2Volume decrease, bla blathe usual final stages of a dead shit coin.
Holy shit that 480k sellorder.
Somebody really wants to push this down.
