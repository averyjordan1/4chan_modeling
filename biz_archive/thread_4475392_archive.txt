Is anybody actually buying bitcoin with fiat at these prices?
I donâ€™t know anyone that has bought bitcoin since it broke $5kWhen will it stop?
BITFINEX IS INSOLVENT AND IS PRINTING USDT TO PUMP UP THE PRICE IN HOPES THAT THEIR BITCOINS BECOME VALUABLE ENOUGH TO PAY OUT USD TETHER WITHDRAWALS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY DISABLED.
They also hold a ton of IOTA and are pumping up the price of this scam.

I tossed $500 at btc when it hit the dip at 5900
