Hey /biz/ it's been a while.I've been trading BCH, POWR, and STILL holding MEI!
I'll be holding BCH, and ETH for the coming week, no BTC.Anyway what I wanted to talk to you guy about is DigitalX or DCC as it is listed on the asx.
This is the company that advised on the POWR ico.
They help with networking and marketing for tokens because they are well established in the crypto community.
This also means that they know when they are onto a winner.Currently, DigitalX is holding 3 tokens in their portfolio.
These are POWR (which has been a massive winner for them), BNK, and FUEL.BNK is not something I am particularly interested in because it will start off with a 200 mil marketcap, not much room to grow.But look at FUEL.
Just listed on BINANCE with a 40mil marketcap.
This could potentially be POWR all over again.
Expect at least 3x from this coin before eoy.Anyway DYOR but this will be big.
