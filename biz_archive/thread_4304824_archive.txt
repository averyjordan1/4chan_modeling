I have never seen anyone here endorse BCH and now all of a sudden 70% of the posts here are BCH shilling.
people changing their minds means there is shillinghow new are you guys?
crypto is a quickly changing marketyour inability to adapt will cost you a lot of money
its a coup - make sure youre on the right side
You only need 1 bitcoin in 2020 to make it anon...
You just need to out 1 bitcoin into 3 coins and have them go 2x and you've made it.Adx, Trig, and Parkbyte
It's probably an organized pump.https://twitter.com/coinraven/status/929423870641176576BTC is at $6,400 right now.
It should be fine.BCH is forking for an emergency difficulty adjustment that kicks in tomorrow night.Tomorrow night btc will be 3x more profitable to mine
people falling for this BTC BCH flipping shit are so fucking stupid
Yes
Wow it's almost as though there was a failure of the one plausible onchain scaling option Bitcoin had.Amazing how changing fundamentals changes value
paid shills
Why trig?
It's /biz/, there is no organization, there are no high rollers here.
These are trolls high on their lucky choices, riding the lightning.
They'll be the same people posting JUST in 2 weeks when BTC inevitable recovers.
