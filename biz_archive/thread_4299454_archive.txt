Why is everything falling again?
cause this "decentralized money" nonsense was all a lie and the devs of Bitcoin were the central part of this entire fucking market and since they're fucking incompetent and BTC is expensive and slow everything is dying
I am literally losing hair over this.
I feel so fucking bad mentally and physically.
Please just let this madness stop.
Crypto has taken over my entire life and my mental state is entirely dependant on how my portfolio is developing.
JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP.
maybe the normies who said"investing in crypto is retarded" were right
bitcoin reached the top at 7800 and was due for a correction.
will stay above 5k though.bch tards and paid shills think its muh flippening, but no
Someone post the BTC ATH picture but replace it with BCH.
That sums it up.
There are only about 12 real non shills here who think this.
BCH is trash.
All to undermine the true King Bitcoin.
I'm getting stressed from the five paid BCH shills pretending they are majority.
LISTEN NEWFAGS DO NOT LISTEN.
