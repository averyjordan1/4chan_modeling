SWIFT is already a nobody.
Do you use SWIFT?
How about your friends?
Does anyone you know use SWIFT?
No.
But plenty of people on here have bought XRP at one point.
XRP already > SWIFT in adoption, usage, price, tech, etc

Pretty much any bank that does international wire transfers uses SWIFT.
I have personally used it when sending money overseas.
