The only loser here is the exchange that accepted 30 mlln tethers for btc since those tethers are locked out now.
So more details may emerge and authorities may be enlisted by the exchange or they themselves taking initiative to investigate like they did the GDAX crash.
Whatever drop in prices was the guys in front of computers and bots.
Now as more people wake up to the news will they want to buy or sell upon hearing the news especially if no further details are yet available?
