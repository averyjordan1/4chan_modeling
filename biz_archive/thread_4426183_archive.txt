i have been bro... tripled my stack over the last few weeks.
I originally bought in for like $0.12 but sold off when BTC started mooning, bought back in around ~$0.6-0.7 and made a few swing trades.
Over 200k coss atm, feeling comfy and confident.
er meant $0.06-0.07

even 60-70 cents would be possible.
COSS is so undervalued right now
is this coin a scam?
