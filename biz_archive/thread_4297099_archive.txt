Do we ever discuss this here?
I'm planning to hold this long term.
Is that a good idea?
No one?
I'm holding it long-term.
I think it's a very good idea.A lot of the really solid projects don't have a ton of hype, but yes, they'll go up.
It's a legit company, they're forming real partnerships.
I think within the next year, a lot of those ICOs that were just white papers with no real implementation will just crumble - it'll be make or break it for delivering what they promised.
I think something like Vechain will definitely survive given their steady growth and supply chain partners, PwC, etc.
What's the basic run-down, anon?
