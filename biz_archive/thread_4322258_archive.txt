He doesn't know how high a tulip went for at the peakAnon, if BTC is tulip mania, we are going to be so fucking rich before it crashes.

A tulip was literally worth a house along a canal in Amsterdam at ATH.
lel, very true at least tulips are somewhat visually appealing

Real prices never got like that, the peak values were retarded historians not understanding futures.

Yup.
At ATH a *single* Tulip was worth 10 years salary.>cucks dont realise that everyone who got into tulips early became absolutely rich as fuck>cucks dont realise almost everyone in crypto for more than a year has pocketed a handsome profit a long time ago and is now playing with free 'profited money'>cucks *still* think wagecucking is better than cryptoI honestly don't understand the level of delusion.
I have 200k in my bank account from crypto, in USD.
I'm 24.
Does it hurt your brain to think people have made this much money doing nothing?>spoiler alert: what I have is nothing compared to what other people have.
