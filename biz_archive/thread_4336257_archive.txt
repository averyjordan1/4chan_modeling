Anyone spotted this project?
I think it has true potential as the gaming industry, streaming and content making keeps growing.>Refereum uses the blockchain to directly connect developers and influencers, resulting in lower marketing costs and increased profits for everyone.
In addition to more effective growth, Refereum strengthens engagement by offering cash prizes â€” enabling rewards for anything from an in-game high score to an eSports grand prize.
We are working closely with Twitch and Unity, and anyone can play our open source demo today.They already have a beta platform for earning Refereum by watching streams, streaming yourself, referring it to your friends, hanging out in Discord lobby etc.Pre-ico is live right now, but minium amount you have to invest is 20k.
Main ico is Dec 12. and theres no minium amount.Websitehttps://refereum.com/Beta sitehttps://earn.refereum.com/
Use my ref code if you want to test it!#3135
Anything ending in -eum after Eth hints at lack of creativity.
I totally agree, but still promising project!I think the name would be better for some ponzi company :D
