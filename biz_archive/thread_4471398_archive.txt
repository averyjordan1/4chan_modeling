Anyone else comfy waiting for DNT to moon this evening?Top kek to all the pajeets buying shicoins while we ride this ship to lamboland.
Strap on
no better feeling than drop the DNT and XRP bags.Nobody is going to recommend this shit, devs does not give a fuck about token value, at all.So, just give up and drop those bags for whatever you can get.
Why is it supposed to moon?
The PBC thing, right?
when and why dnt
Jesus you have no idea.
A dev that doesn't care about token value cares about PRODUCT first.Get fucking real.You're going to die poor.
Even if you get money.
this token has no value hahahahwhy would you invest in this shit
I feel so sorry for all the people falling for this shit, anyone with half a brain already figured out which coin it's gonna be
so which one of the three is it going to be
yeah!!
you will have a great product with NO VALUE!!
!Enjoy your bags, pajeet!
sitting on 20k....already 20% in the green...so comfy

Seems like a PnD being worked on.
Which discord is trying to pump this shit?
I'm in Vizard's shit PnD discord and it's not them at least.
