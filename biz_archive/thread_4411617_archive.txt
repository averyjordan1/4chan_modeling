...So, where are your buy orders?
on BTC and Dogewhy?
I have 1400 of these in the off chance it becomes worth anything, ever.
According to blockfolio it cost me $4Colorful bags is all they are
that's literally nothing.Even if they go to 10x their value, you haven't made any money
Tying up money in this shit is retarded.
You might as well play the lottery.
