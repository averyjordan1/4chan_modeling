Oh look.
ETH almost back to 300, ripple almost back to 0.2 even with BTC tanking.
and some faggots were saying yesterday ETH is going to 400 GET IN NOW !!!
lmao
what do you mean.
ripple is down 6% for the last 24h
Point is, money isn't flowing from bitcoin to alts after all.
If bitcoin tanks money goes back to fiat.
ah yes ok, I guess there are two cases, when money in btc goes in to alts, I suppose that happens when people think the market is stable enough to invest in alts.
if they think it's not they exchange it in to Fiat
>Oh look.
ETH almost back to 300, ripple almost back to 0.2 even with BTC tanking.XRP is down to .21 from its high of .22 but still up from .20 over the last few days.
It's a pretty solid safe haven when everything else is going fucking crazy.
I was one of those shills.
And you know what?
I actually believed it too.
I really thought this was the actual and final true breakout of ETHWhat a sad, small pathetic man I am.
I will wear these bags with shame.
Just the rumors of the kraken hax being the cause of difficulties on that site.
Hardware is the way to go
