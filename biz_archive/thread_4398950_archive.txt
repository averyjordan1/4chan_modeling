Most legit ICO of the year closes on the 24th.
Sells for a dollar a token at ICO.
Orders at less than half of that on ED.
Why aren't you guys scooping up cheap FENX on ED?

shhh still trying to acummulate
I'd rather a bunch of /biz/ posters get a bunch then a few whales.
Harder to manipulate.
pls donâ€™t buy my bags im just trying to accumulate >plushpepe.jpeg
You're never gonna make it.
Enjoy your LINK bags
Fuck youthanks
Whatever Pajeet
I guess /biz/ hates money
says the website is not secure.
Works fine for me
Scam, it's not actually listed, don't click links to etherdelta ever
Etherdelta URL is always of the form <etherdelta.com/#COINNAME#-ETH>where #COINNAME# is the ticker.
Doesn't exist for FENX
It's a real link I listed the etherscan to prove it.
All ERC 20 tokens are listed by design.
When the ICO ends next week and it's officially listed expect it to pump.
Dude find a coin that is officially listed.Then type in https://etherdelta.com/#tokenaddress-ETH It will redirect you to the token.
website doesn't use https.
Aright I was wrong, fair enoughWhat do you mean "offers at half a dollar tho"There is one offer, and it's for like a tiny fraction of a cent per fenx
Sell orders are at less than half of ICO price.
THe reason I'm interested in this thread is that 38 days ago an anon on this board from FENX gave away a bunch of FENX tokens to people who posted in his thread.
I'm sitting on 10k for literally saying "hi gimme FENX" so it seems unlikely anyone is gonna buy these from me for a dollar a pop loool
Just because it was air dropped does not mean it won't have value.
See GBYTE, Deep Onion and OHNI.
I made 1 ETH selling OHNI.
Can't I just mine an ICO with my own hardware.If I have to pay someone else to pre-mine for me, it seems a bit dubious as we get into the 3rd party issue.
Lucky guy I bought 6000 the other day for only 4.5 eth.
I'm confident that it will double in the next couple of weeks.
lmao are you guys kidding me, this is an obvious shit ico
Bro I'll honestly sell you 4k for like 1eth
i hold 10k but this is a shitcoin lol
Put up the order
Ive decided not to sell.
This actually looks legit promising holy shitWhen I realized how it is like a better version of torrenting I was soldhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8B4QqgpoKs
I'll pay more.
How bought 1.5 ether?
ANOTHER shitcoin far below ICO priceICOs are dead
I mean bro put up the orders, someone will probably fill them
But nobody knows about the super secret way to buy FENX
https://etherdelta.com/#0x017188526374f723ec66509ea0c44dd797a33c84-ETHLooks like there about 1k available for 0.3 eth.
That's close to the deal I was offering
4403096I ended up posting some for sale at 0.00054.
Bretty gud if you want in.
I need like $150 to pay rent honestly
Jesus christ this board get's worse everyday.WARNING EVERYONE OP IS THE OWNER OF ALL THOSE SHITCOINS.
THEY HAVE NO VALUE, THIS IS A SCAM.HE WAS LITERALLY GIVING THEM AWAY FOR FREE A FEW WEEKS AGO TO GET PEOPLE SHILLING FOR HIM!!!
Yeah there was an airdrop.
That was only 10% of the coins.
It was lottery style.
I got 1000.
Some others got 10k.
Most got none.
airdropKYS
Most tokens give about 10-20% away now a days in airdrops to put into more hands and help fight whale manipulation
Correct
Shill Team 6, gimme the market cap at least
depends on ICO success because the tokens get burned.
Around 1.5 million at the current rate
I'm fucking pumped.
My 200k gwei order got filled
Yeah by me lmao get dumped on
I bought 10k I'm so ready.
Yep this shit is going to moon so hard in a few days.
a better version of torrentingExplain?
I can't watch the video now.
