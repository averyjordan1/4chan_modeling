Went from 1.9btc to 0.9 btc this week with bch.And fatfingered an order on hitbtc.What should I do?
Don't play with bch fire unless you know what you're doing.
Buy ETH and hold.
Still have 1.7 bch left.
Should I sell?Already sold at a loss part of it.
It's not going to recover anytime soon and vertcoin looks better.
I want to recover asap.
I wonder how many /biz/tards got burned by BCH.
Mooning already
you bought high?now it's time to sell low
