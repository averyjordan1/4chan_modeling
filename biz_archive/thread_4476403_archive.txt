is like a lending coin, i never knew about this coin, with alot of whales, i am autisticposter, so suddenly it appears
This shitcoin is sketchy as fuck, I feel like no one's actually interested in it except some private group that's trying to pnd on retards.

There is no doubt it is a high risk coin (low volume, small market cap, etc).
But getting in this early, before it is easily traded and while the mining difficulty is low, is also potentially very smart if the developers are wise enough to see the opportunity they have created.
All they have to do is legitimize it enough to get a few outsiders on board, keep making fun uses for the coin, and make it easier to adopt.
Because it is worth so little now, with relatively little effort we could see 10x gains.
I am banking on the idea that the developers see that opportunity and keep up their work, but like any of these small coins it's a gamble.
Another underrated aspect is how little money you need to be a major force in the market for it.
There is no stock that you can easily own 2% of, but it's not unrealistic to buy that big a share in 4CH.
I bought this one for the fun, but already it's been my biggest earner as far as altcoins go... still bullish.
Not sure why you linked me your profile, but the bitcointalk thread on this coin has barely any posts, and most of them are from people calling it a piece of shit
downloading anything posted on 4chan
Very nice
