I have been quietly accumulating my baby (ae) for several months now, and I have only seen this mentioned in this board once which I am really lucky for because the price would have exploded.
Now that I have an amount I am really happy with, it is time for me to start shilling.
This is IMO the most fully featured blockchain that will ever exist, it will destroy ethereum.>solves the oracle problem (oracles built right into the blockchain)>proof of work and proof of stake hybrid (cuckoo algorithm)>aeapps (dapps but better)>state channels (smart contracts inside off chain channels)>complete privacy>turing complete>testnet soon>security audit q4 2017>mainnet q4 2017>predicted future value $300 eachknowledge is power:https://www.aeternity.com/https://www.reddit.com/r/aeternityhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1733140.0
whooops I meant>mainnet q1 2018Once this comes out, it will be in the top 5 coins no doubt, and then up to #2 or #3 from there.ALSO ALSO Look at the list of developers there's so many people working on this
You also forgot the part where the lead dev claims to be the godfather of ethereum.
Tbh, if he has to label himself as that the project is probably shit lmao.
I was in the ICO, got my free ledger and everything (still had to pay for shipping)... what about the whole drama with zach?
I like the language it's written in but I don't have much hope for it, got rid of my bags last week
for reference apparently the CEO beat up the lead dev with his belt LOL the dude fled the country you can't invent that shit
ya it might be shit, but it may not be.
Either way, it has more potential of being good than being shit.I'm so glad the price dropped because of all that drama, it was so much easier to accumulate that way.
This could be one of those pink wojak moments in the future where people sold like 10000 ethereum for $5 back then.
I want to add the progress being done on the project, it would be a joke if there weren't any progress going on, but every week or so you get updates.Here is their github:https://github.com/aeternity
Aeternity blog with weekly updates: https://blog.aeternity.com/yeah this isn't like LINK or REQ where you got one 30 year old dev working on the entire thing, here you have a bunch of people in their 30s but also older developers in their 50s working on it.
It's not a joke.I mean you got FUDDERS in here, but this is a top notch project.
