That's always been there.There is obviously a partnership behind the scenes but there has been no official announcement yet

Sergey has always referred to SWIFT as one of smartcontract's "customers"
Link is such a bargain.
My only wish is I had more money to throw at it.

Why the fuck do you Linkbots think SWIFT, the Belgian kings of money, would give half a shit about about getting paid in 10 cent internet tokens that can only be cashed out on exchanges that deal in things actively trying to eat SWIFT's lunch?
Let alone assist in any kind of development?
SWIFT does not, and will never, have anything to do with this swarmcity tier shittoken.
so they'll just roll over and let Ripple kill them?doubt it
buy ChainLink Out?
what do you mean?
SWIFT does not, and will never, have anything to do with this swarmcity tier shittoken.>Invites them to their annual presentation twice in a row.>Listed as a "user" on the website>never have anything to do with themYou're already wrong.
It's just a question of how much more wrong are you going to be.
proud to be working with swift on their own swift oracleso not chainlink?
This part of Chain Link is what I don't understand, but I think it works like this.
They will develop the oracle for Swift, and then Chain Link would serve as the decentralized nodes enforcing their oracle.
Flush it down
So I started to dig and some of the BIC codes involved in these transactions are related to ING Belgium.
SWIFT partnership seems legit.
IBAN reference in some of the contract code matches this document.

Link hits 10.00 song..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Uhn-dU3Gg
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH MY LINK IT'S ALL GONE NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO
It was used for the proof of concept.
Not an actual transaction.
Hold your tits.Nice digits by the way
or maybe they are helping swift develop their own network and chainlink is just smartcontract.com's network that they hope to get users on one day
the devs say it'll take a while before this thing is up and running, it will stay around 18 cents until mid 2018
Bull fucking shit.
Most people here are already disappointed it will probably only hit $1 before EOY.
Be grateful if link is above 10 cents by Eoy
Without bittrex or news it'll stay stuck.There will be no bittrex and we can pretty much rule out any news.If it rises it'll be due to a general influx into alts.
And there are certainly better ones to be in for the next few months.
i've talked to the devs, they doubt it'll rise much in price because there is nothing publicly to talk about.
they also don't want to get onto other exchanges until spring 2019 when they feel it'll be mature enough
and now its at 16cents....WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
cents Wier way to spell sats
4309624Nothing to do with the link token.
You guys are just raising funds for some silicon valley poofter that's selling you his resume.
Plus trex is really reticent to put anything new on their exchange that could possibly be classified as a security.
Any POS coin could be seen as paying out a dividend, link could possibly be seen as a dividend payout, and is too sketchy for trex to touch.
larp
weird way to spell 1 mill
it's true.
they aren't concerned with traders when they're trying to negotiate with bankers.
but they prefer a cheap token price to incentivize the use.
50 cents is about as good as it gets
CHAINLINK TO THE MOON !!!!!!!!!!!!!
!SERGEY IS SATOSHI CONFIRMEDS ERGEYS ATOSHIN AKAMOTON AZAROVSMARTCONTRACT.COM WAS BOUGHT AS DOMAIN 8 DAYS BEFORE SATOSHI'S FIRST POST
Nice larp, where/when did you talk to the devs and which devs?
Shut the fuck up, not a single thing you wrote applies to LINKi've talked to devsI've talked with Trump and he said he'll personally make sure it's listed on Bittrex by January.
