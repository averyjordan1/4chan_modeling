Hello my minimal wagemstes (MWM) Since i own a few Link i would like to own a few Request Network tokens.I did some research but i would consider myself as dum.
Am i just hyped/biasd or is it really something that might hit some dollars?
"If biz hates Req as much as it hates Link.
I definitely will buy some.

Only buy if you're willing to hold long term OP.
If you day trade there's probably no worse coin.
It will most likely hit ICO price soon but don't expect too many x's before testnet release (q4 2017) at least
 q4 2017We are in q4 2017, manAlso, I wantedd to participate in REQ ICO, but missed whitelisting.
Bought 4k REQ lately and quite happy about it.BTW, what was the $ price of REQ at ICO?
