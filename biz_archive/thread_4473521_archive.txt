look at his eyes.
he's out to lunch...
BcashI don't want to get yelled at by monopolist Chinese billionaires.
I cant wait for my sweet gainz :DD.
No but in all seriousness, BCH will have one of the sickest runs in history comming the next 1 - 2 weeks.
It is holding and consolidating at a realy strong support level.
If you have not bought in you are plainly retarded.
Even if it wont work, it will drop what..10-15% in the next DAYS with the chance of going to 3k.
This is simple cost - risk analysis jesus.
seriously?
