Would gas be a good short term buy right now?
It's pretty low and it's gonna eventually have to return to normal.. right?
great buy.
Soy boy coin.
dont buy yetthe news tomorrow from NEO is non-government related meaning the price of both NEO and GAS and LRC will all dump.
wait for the dump and then wait even longer cause there will be a long period of sell off following a big let down.
then buy in.
