Link's masterplan is starting to emerge.
They will be the defacto oracle for all of them and working behind the scenes to be first.

Genuine question, why is LINK only shilled on 4chan?
I don't see it mentioned or shilled anywhere else this hard.
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddit likes to jump on things way too late
ITS HAPPENING/biz/ is always the first.
most every pump in the last yr started on here.
I've tried to talk about it on reddit and the users there a literally too retarded to get their heads around it.Say what you want about 4chan being a cesspit of autistic faggotry but this board has way more insight when it wants to.
basically our crypto autism > theirs
the fuck?
does SmartContract have this many competitors?
Its not competitors.
They are all just promising blockchain companies tackling different problems.

The absolute desperation of deluded Linkies
This is one of the most pathetic things I’ve ever seen.
