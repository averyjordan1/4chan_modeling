ive been putting 200 bucks a week on chainlink since the end of last month (almost 1 monthgive it to me straight /biz/, what are the chances that flushing those $200 every week down my toilet instead of investing it in link will have the same result?dont lie to me /biz/.
i can handle the truth
Should have been doing half BTC and half chain or something 2bh
well at least youll get a couple dollars back for every 200 you spend in link...
well flushing it down the toilet at least has the chance of making the plumber a little richer
99.9 % it fails.
the idea is good but the distribution of the links and the execution of the project is horrible.
doesnt help that sergey Now is loaded too and just doesnt care.
the is the truth.
did Research it a lot.
dont listen to all the shills
That fat fuck is a millionaire now.
