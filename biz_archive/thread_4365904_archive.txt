I have 52 BTC to invest, how do I 2x this in 24 hours.
Give me some alts to buy.
BAT, set to pump within this week
hmm I might just go all in BAT :D
Any coin that can 2x in that amount of time is gonna be too low volume for you to viably be able to enter and exit with that much BTC.
I meant a high volume coin such as BAT
Zencash.
You could easily manipulate the price of this coin with your 50 BTC
POWR.
Just listed to Bittrex.
All it would need would be a little push to start mooning again, since highs and lows are established yet.
Probably could easily buy now and drive the price up to 8500-8750
grs
ETP, but in 72 hours
Bitcoin (cash)
delusional bagholder
hmm
volume too low
Can confirm this
