Ima put 5k in a diversified portfolio but I'd like to use my CC to make the purchase.Are there legit exchanges with low transaction costs which accept non US credit cardsWhat do you think about btcc.
Com is it legit ?
Anybody
people on this board have no credit.
KekWhat does biz think of btcc.com im thinking of investing through cryptocapital as they low fees.Is it a scam
The only exchange I bought from with CC was coinbase.
I buy on coinbase and then trade on bittrex, seems to work well enough
no and you can't.
Plus the fees are ridiculous using a CC.
most CC will deny and its a pain in the ass to set it up and you'll more than likely get the CC banned from being used on that exchange.
You're better off finding a way to deposit that money into your bank account and linking it
if it gets declined u just call them
i i have this sudden urge to rape her
No word on cryptocapital.co ?
They are Panama based And are partners of btcc.comLegit ?
Buying crypto with a credit card at 16% interest.Bubble.
>Buying bitcoin the day before bitcoin chain deathWelcome to the ranks of soon to be pink wojaks, OP.
Coinbase.
There is a fee.
No interest, wtf?
Poor fuck.
Just pay it off and there is no interest?Use coinbase OP.
Higher fee than using a bank account though.
Coinbase doesn't accept credit cards issued outside the US.I can ask my friend to link his US bank account on coinbase but then I thought btcc.com is a better option, biz doesn't like btcc.com or cryptocapital.co ?
Abra app just started allowing people to buy w/ American Express.
$1000 max per month though.
