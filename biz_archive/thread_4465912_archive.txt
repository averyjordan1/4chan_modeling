Shitton if it hits 5 cents
I went all in on Confido just a few days ago because /biz/ shilled it.
I don't know waht the fuck I'm gonna do.
Please do, and post proof.

Just realised its at 3 cents.
Ill see how low it goes and ill buy at least 1000 tokens
Sorry to hear that anon.
I've got nothing against bad daytrading.
I am so bad at that myself that I don't even try it.
But it doesn't mean that I delude myself into believing that a coin I bought for short term gains and nothing else are hold material.
Most of /biz/ do that.
It's like you hate money
