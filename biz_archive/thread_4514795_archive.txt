Just launched on ED, raised on 1M for ico.
New exchange coming up this week.
18 team members (JESUS), the early Amazon feels(Book publishing & distribution).Check them out.
Nice, looks like a no brainer to accumulate now for an easy 3x when it gets picked up by exchanges.
Just bought a sizeable chunk
