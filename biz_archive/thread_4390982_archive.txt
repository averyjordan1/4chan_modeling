Lost over 10k EUR of BCH gains by not selling earlier.
FML.
Anyway, now that I have Blockstream Coin again, it will most certainly dip.
Atleast you're not me.
Is that it?
I lost a whole btc because of bch
I could've had over 8.4 bitcoin when it was .4I want to kill myself
I could have had 12 BTC.
At least I still made gains with it and still hold more of it than BTC just in case the flippening happens
Buy the next dip(not today but in the coming days), it will pump again next BTC difficulty adjustment.

You are a sinner.
it's okay anon, I'm still holding BCH, which means it's doomed to a slow death.As long as I hold a coin, it's going down.
This is how the universe works.
Don't worry, I won't let go, I'll go into the icy depths so you can survive on your BTC driftwood.
Never let go...
