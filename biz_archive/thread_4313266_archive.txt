>only just sold BTCholy fuck the transfer just went through holy shit thank god.
only 3k loss.WHAT DO I DO NOW

BCH not to late
Still a little more momentum in the bch pump, if you're feeling saucey...
>going back up again
Put in BCH.
You will make it up within the next week.
What is a bull trap Alex?
/thread
watching you idiots fall right into the trap is making this shitstorm pretty enjoyableis no one even questioning the fact that over 50% of BCH volume is in korean exchanges, conveniently low-fee and conveniently right next to china?this is going to be so painful for so many people, when the core update goes into effect to stop 0 fee tx spam and difficulty readjusts in BTC's favor ( i think tomorrow?)
I am aware, I just want the fuck out of bitcoin before it goes down to 4k, probably just going to rebuy it at the bottom.NOT buying BCH its fishy as hell
