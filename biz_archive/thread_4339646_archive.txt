why the fuck is bitman aka Jihan mining bitcoin again?
I thought it pet project was the Bcrash the real deal?
he literally owns too much hashpower in miningthere isn't even enough to go around if he switches to bcc as it is right now.. look at it even right now 8mb blocks and rarely more than 6kb is even used... literally no one uses this shitcoin lmao
bcash fork doesn't happen for a few more hours
so if 6kb goes to 8mb hypothetically ?
wouldnt transaction fees go up as well?
Diff adjustment by EDA
yes.
and if theoretically that were to ever happen, and enough people started using bcash, their fees would start to get high again, and they would have to fork into another coin with even bigger blocks.
btc is more profitable to mine for the next 12 hours but that changes when the bch fork is completed, thats when all miners will switch hash power permanently to bch, thats why its mooning right now.
The rocket is fueling right now so there are still seats.
