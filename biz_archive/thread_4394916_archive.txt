Is it over before it even begun?
B-b-but we're first movers
golden rule is , buy absolutely anything else then what is mentioned on /biz and you shall receive the fastest gains known to man kind.
huh?
what have I missed here?
I am so glad I learned genuine patience from having a normal portfolio for years before discovering crypto.
Your minds have all been warped by crypto exploding, fast gains of 10x or 100x are surreal, at least be able to wait for them to happen.
I am so glad I learned genuine patience from having a normal portfolio for years before discovering crypto.thisLINK is more akin to real investing than other tokens.
if you don't have patience, go run off to your moon missions.
good luck.
believe the larps that everybody here is getting 10x moons every day except you.
Ripple cucks had their coin briefly moon so now their going into LINK fudding overdrive.
Link is a slow coin.
You buy in for cents now for dollars per coin in a couple years.
Also at these prices, with this amount of shilling, I think you pretty much have to buy a little LINK just as insurance in case the linkies are right.
Otherwise when it has its first pump you will fomo and buy high, guaranteed - the shilling will be like nothing weâ€™ve ever seen.
exactly.
own 1000 link it case it does moon.
pretty sure it will eventually but it wouldn't be the worse thing in the world to lose like $250 on a coin that is shilled so often here
/biz/ shills got to me and made me buy 110 link.Pretty small amount, but still better than nothing.
Starting to have some doubts about tokens value/importance.
Im still hodling 8400 linkies.
Nothing else impresses me enough to dump tho.
Not yet...
the importance of the token to the system is not in doubt.
