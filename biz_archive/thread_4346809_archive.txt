YC business tactics are EXTREMELY passive.
YC completely fucks around with their startups.
They will not push Request down the throats of the normies in Silicon Valley and they will drop their bags like addicts.
They did nothing to help Airbnb, Dropbox, Twitch etc to go mainstream and they will most likely not make Request into Venmo/PayPal 2.0
Who gives a fuck.
All I care about is them appearing to be the next PayPal so even Normie money comes in after 2018 they flood this coin and I cash out.
Crypto market is even more aggressive.
Next.
