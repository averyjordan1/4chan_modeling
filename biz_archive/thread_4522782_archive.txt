Can we create a objectively profitable long-term portfolio?
This is, one with the best ratio of risk/reward for hodling an entire year.
It probably won't moon, it probably won't even increase tenfold, but not it won't get JOOSTed either.
As long as the crypto market exists (it could be dead in a year's time, who knows), this portfolio must thrive.It is meant to be divided into each corresponding coin wallet.
Hardware wallets, paper wallets, whatever they are, but having full control over it.
Not in an exchange, since we're not going to trade.
If it was in an exchange, it would at the very least be in a reputable, liquid one (Kraken perhaps?)
that you can cash out from when the time comes.I'll start:% BTC% BTH% ETH% XMR% Any alt that's at least in the top 100 of market cap, having done proper research - preferably if it has at least one year of lifeRules:1.
The portfolio with the most (You) wins.2.
Any coin that's not Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Dash, Litecoin or Monero must be referred to as "alt".
So we don't engage in with linkies.3.
Do not explain your rationale behind it.
If the portfolio is good, it won't need your explanation.
no Ark> not gonna make it

---- This comment violates rule number 2 - Please disregard ----
Please, use percentages as this portfolio must be designed regardless of the capital available to invest.
10% BTC% BTC% BTC% BTC% BTC
Approved.
Try grouping all percentages of the same coin into one next time.
In this case:% BTC
Low risk100% BTCHigh risk 50% LINK50% XVG
40% BTC20% ETH10% XMR10% NEO10% OMG5% ARK5% ETP

Euhm1 BTC = 8200$1 BCH = 1300$10 LTC= 700$10 XMR = 1500$1 DASH = 500$sum: 12200$ BTC = 67%BCH = 10%LTC = 5.7%XMR = 10%DASH = 4%give or take a bit
40% BTC30%ETH20% XMR10% LTC
% ETH25% BTC15% NEOI don't even own any of these right now.
But I do know what's safe.
50% BTC (the BTC that will win the war, can be BTC BTH LTC etc.
)20% ETH30% POWRAnything else at this point is shitcoins or scams.The coins above can only go up.
wow you're autistic
This is more or less my portfolio aside from alts.
long term>an entire year!C'mon op, get your head out of your ass.
9/10 we go into a bearish market for the majority of the year.
Picks should be coins that should be traded / evaluated against / with fiat.
Well, Iconomi's BLX is a portfolio which is on %50 gains this month, outperforming bitcoin (for now).
Bitcoin 15.00 %Ethereum 14.15 %Dash 12.60 % Monero 12.34 %Lisk 10.22 %Waves 5.73 %Steem 4.42 %Augur 3.65 %Golem 3.34 %MaidSafeCoin 2.83 %Basic Attention Token 2.78 %DigixDAO 2.71 %Factom 2.18 %GameCredits 2.08 %Siacoin 2.05 %SingularDTV 1.49 %iExec 0.90 %Aragon 0.70 %WeTrust 0.41 %Synereo 0.21 %Matchpool 0.21 %I have 50% BLX, 25% ETH and 25% BTC
Bitcoin 50%Bitcoin Cash 30%Dash 10%Monero 10%I call this the "digital cash" strategy.It's weighted more towards alts since there is a risk of Bitcoin failing at that.
BTC is still the most significant holding though.If lightning network is proven on the live network and seems to be getting adoption I'll move more into Bitcoin.>Do not explain your rationale behind it.
If the portfolio is good, it won't need your explanation.no u

I like this idea and it's similar to my portfolio except I have a larger stake in Dash.
Sell me on LTC.
Objectively:>Lowest fees>Quickest transactions (out of decentralized coins)>Gets onboard with the latest upgrades before anyone else (SegWit/Lightning)>>Tried and tested (old coin)>Historically stable, very little volatility (only spiked when it got added to Coinbase and only dipped during the btc forks, like every other coin)Personally though, I really like:>The community around it, as they aren't cancer tribalists who attack people for using/supporting other coins.>They collaborate with other coins and systems instead of seeking to damage the crypto ecosystem, as BCH does.

..also LTC is on most exchanges, so easily accessible.
What's it's use?
Nah I just like larping as an autist.In crypto an entire year is an eternity to be honest.
I meant it in the sense of just "leaving it there" without having to be constantly up to date with the last developments.
Small-scale transactions.
you are going to make it anon
What businesses accept it as payment?
Not enough currently, I wish BitPay would pick up Litecoin as it's far better for transactions.There's a list here:https://litecoin.com/services#merchants
Thanks for the info.
I'll look into it.
I meant it in the sense of just "leaving it there" without having to be constantly up to date with the last developments.100% on ETH then, when even the news of Vitalik being a pedo didn't keep it from rising, you know it's the safest, most idiot-proof to get rich.
Yup, ETH will definitely be in my portfolio.
But so far I've made most of my gains thanks to Bitcoin Cash.So perhaps 20% ETH.
