So OMG's use case can be entirely supplanted by smart contracts, can't it?
I'm guessing yes?
Smart contracts are Turing complete, you can do anything with them.
Omisego tokens are used to incentivise validators for offchain transaction resolution through staking.
Doing this off the ethereum chain allows for the scalability required to handle massive transaction volumes required for exchanges or financial networks.
Basically anyone holding omisego is going to be rich in 2018+
offchain transactionLike what?>Doing this off the ethereum chain allows for the scalability required to handle massive transaction volumes required for exchanges or financial networks.Wait, so it's a bandaid for an overwhelmed blockchain?
OMG tokens will verify all payments processed through Omise right now.
They're developing this blockchain because it will speed up their entire business once plasma is released.
They're used the same way paypal is used in SEA.
They're making their own chain because for the kind of scale they're going for, it only makes sense.
you're not going to make it sorry anon
Smart contracts are not turing complete.
Turing machines can express non-terminating programs, and smart contracts cannot.
OMG tokens will verify all payments processed through Omise right now.Sounds like a roundabout way to avoid adding data to a blockchain through oracles.
Lol I'm not selling
its just faster for their network and needs, link will be successful also for different use case
You can express it, you just can't execute it Infinitly without infinite gas.
Solidity is turing complete just like the EVM
