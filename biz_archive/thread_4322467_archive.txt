it not only FAILED to flip the real bitcoin but got FLIPPLED by its clone coin, there are no words to describe the epic rekting...this is no coincidence, the market will never value this shit over a real blockchain.
billions jumping from BCH and BTC, i wonder who is the fat fuck?
massive hackEthereum wasn't hacked it was a shoddily made smart contract
Ethereum has already made Bitcoin obsolete.
Itâ€™s only a matter of time before the third worlders wake up to this reality and the price which is propped up by pyramid schemes from Vladivostok to Bombay crashes to nothing and Vitalik anally gapes you with his giant headface

Ethereum is still in smart money phase.Bitcoin is at mass mania phase.Soon bitcoin will crash.Probably due to the Ethereum ecosystem rendering it obsolete
