Hello, I want something that wakes me up when a cryptocurrency reaches a certain value.
Pretty much like the alerts on the blockfolio app, but much louder like an alarm clock.When the blockchain alarm goes off my phone vibrates, so If I were to place something on my phone that will make noise when the phone vibrates, it would work too.
Not sure what that would be though, maybe some kind of toy.
