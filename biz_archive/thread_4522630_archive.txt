For all you increasingly worried corecucks out there:.
Everyone who held BTC prior to 1st August, has an equal amount of BCH.
Long term holders therefore, at worst, will remain neutral if the flippening occurs.
.
Those who sold their BCH because of Core FUD immediately turned from hodlers to traders, and we must therefore assume were happy to take on the risk.
.
A lot of BCH is still frozen by Coinbase, forcing many newbies to hold, so a flippening before they release it in January would be ideal.
.
Those who did sell BCH early because of Core FUD will be the most likely to then FOMO back into BCH at a loss.
.
A warning shot was fired between 10-12th Nov.
If newbies were caught up in /r/Bitcoin censorship, they would have likely seen the huge price increase (BCH gaining 45% while every single other coin was in red).
.
Crypto hedge funds who did not hedge into BCH are not exercising their fiduciary care of their client's money.
The market will teach them a harsh lesson.
.
The quicker the flippening happens, the less damage there is to newbies entering the space via Bitcoin Core, post 1st August.
.
Despite some ignoring this, every time I hear crypto being touted as an investment, there is almost always the disclaimer to *invest only what you are willing to lose*.
If you have more than that invested into the space and you were not aware of the risks associated with buying Bitcoin Core, you're an idiot.
.
We get to fire Core/Blockstream and show the world just how censorship resistance the Bitcoin (Cash) honey badger truly is.
lemme smash
he thinks bitcoin cash is less centralized than core
Is this not just going to be a huge pump and dump off miners to regain the profits cross network once the difficulty adjusts?Do you recommend selling into BTC or into ETH, at a more stable price point if the correction takes place on an unstable backlog of transactions on the BTC blockchain?
Or hold on to BCH compulsively?
there's no flippening, stop being delusional please.
It makes me sad to think that there are people who really think this
i need the name and fast
>please please please flip before Coinbase dump on Jan 1lol
