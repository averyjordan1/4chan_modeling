Because we want the next 10x coin.
Cardano is solid, but it has a marketcap of 50 trillion, so it's pretty hard to go anywhere from there.
because YTubers shilled it today.
Wait for pullback to jump in if interested imo.
japanese poopcoin that was sold to investors for 1/5th of a cent a couple years ago but only put onto an exchange recently, the target of a notorious pump and dump groupI don't know what to make of it, they do a bad job of marketing themselves and it comes off as an attempt at forming an economic cult, like so many of the cryptos out there.
It's a similar market cap to that of ether's 1 year back.So it's actually a no no?
marketcap of 50 trillionI'm assuming you meant supplyI tend to avoid high supply coins, they appeal to pajeets who want to feel like high rollers by holding over 300 ESP baby
10 mill is high volume?
cool tech
Cardanos time will come.It's one of those coins that I believe normies and institutions are going to get into before /biz/ catches on though.It will most likely come out of nowhere, hidden in plain sight then just explode on the scene.It's a quiet project that could change the very foundation of crypto.The team involved is big, dedicated, and into making something that will work where ETH failed.I'm not saying it could take ETHs place.
ETH may be too well rooted to be toppled.But who knows.
It certainly is a quiet, monster though.When I first heard of ETH, before it was even listed anywhere I had the same feels as I do with Cardano.
Looking at a tech standpoint anyway.I wish I had got into it right then ( eth ) but I failed.
I will not make that mistake again with ADA
Looks like you didnt do any research as to why its even up there.
Thats the thing with people nowadays, they dont go any further than coinmarketcap.com.
Once this baby hits a Japanese exchange, this will go crazy.
Good luck fomoing in then.
