How long will BTC stay in 8200~ hell?
Is ETH recovering in BTC price?
~ hellThe times we live inâ€¦
This is nothing, in two days BTC will CRASH and BCH will soar.
Sell your BTC for BCH, remember i warned you.
Hoping it crashes another 1000 or so before the end of the year so I can buy another 20% then watch it moon again, Let the cycle continue rinse and repeat
