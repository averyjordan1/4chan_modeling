Core cucks are the fucking worst.
They call Bitcoin Cash a worthless shitcoin when it works exactly the same as how Bitcoin did since the genesis block in 2009 until segwit, then they go on to sing bitcoins praises in the same breath.
They are bare faced liars and they know it.
literally owned by chinese kikes
I don't particularly care for bcc or btc, they are both shitcoins and there are many superior coins that do the same job as bcc, all it has going for it is the bitcoin name, just as btc does.
BCH is a worthless copy with 0 innovation and no developers>centralized and owned by chinese miners>basicly only used to trick newfags into buying and than pumping the skimmed money back into Bitcoin
Bcash is an altcoin bro cmon, it's okay let's admit it.
Segwit is an attempt to scale bitcoin that's way more sophisticated that increasing the block size.

I've heard that b4, Blockstream wants to sell sidechain patents.
It's an open source project though, so couldn't anyone develop their own sidechains?
What about the need for exponential scaling?
A block size increase provides only linear scaling.
