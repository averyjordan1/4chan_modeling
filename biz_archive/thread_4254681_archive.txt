BAT threads getting too quickly buried, maybe this "official thread" meme will keep it aliveBUY BAT
I bought 1 bitcoin worth at 5.6k sats
Mercury JUSTed too, eh?
although I only put in .1 btc and still want to killself
Iâ€™ve been buying regularly since 5200 and down to where we are now.
Have almost 300k and no ragrets.
(pls moon tho)
lol BAT will never moonBAT is fucking cursedgive up now, it will somehow get a bunch of positive news, hard fork will end, and it will find a new bottom anywaySet your buy orders for 1000 sats, then maybe you can get 5% profit
Wow people still holding BAt since Mercury?I sold that shit at like 20% loss a long time ago, best decision I ever made
