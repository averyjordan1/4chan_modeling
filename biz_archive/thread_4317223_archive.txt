Remember this feeling?
The feeling that you don't have a voice compared to the miners?
When S2X fucked shit up, when ETH had the parity mistake and when BCH took a run?DCR is the currency for the small folks like us.
We can vote and bind code without the miners.
Keep an eye out folks, crypto needs extra governance.

give it time.
relax, don't think about it too much, stock up, come back later.
Yeah, I have a shitload.
Once BCH gets to #1 I'll double my holdings.
how much is a shitload?
