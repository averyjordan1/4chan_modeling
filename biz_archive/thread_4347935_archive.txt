ParkByte is a blockchain parking app due to release a new website and roadmap very soon I am part of several groups that are planning to take ParkByte $PKB to the $1.50 to $2.00 range , it just skyrocketed to $1 as test run, only needs a little volume and its gone to the moon.
Just a heads up its down to 60 cents now in accumulation phase and will be an easy 1-2x short term and 3-5x mid term.
Target is 25000 sats before years end.
iv seen a ton of buzz around this project lately, but the devs are waiting for the right time to release the news because of the btc fiasco, could be any day now
