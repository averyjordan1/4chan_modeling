I think I might have found a flaw in the mining algorithm of Bitcoinereum, but I'm pretty baked so maybe I fucked something up, but basically, I made a program in python to calculate the total emission time given the supply, halving period, and original(yearly) emission.
Bitcoinereum has an emission rate of 50 per 10 minutes, halving every 10 years.
This is a total of 2628000 mined the first year.
My program is:supply = int(input("Enter supply: "))halving = int(input("Enter halving period: "))emission = int(input("Enter original yearly emission: "))i = 0while(supply > 0): if((i%halving) == 0): emission = .5*emission if(emission == 0): break supply = supply - emission print(emission) print(supply) i = i+1print("Emission time: ", i, " Years")When running the parameters for Bitcoinereum through this program, it never emits all 21000000 coins, stopping with 10488000 un-mined coins.
Can anyone see what I have done wrong, or is this correct?
halving every 4 years, not every 10 years.
AAAAAAAAAAAA MY LINKS
1 * .5 = 0 in Python.
when I print(1*.5) it returns .5
Well the prob is definitely rounding to zero somewhere when it multiplies by .5 it shouldn't be.
Why are you guys mining this coin?
There is no news, no known team, no whitepaper, seems like 1 guys in a basement wanted to make a erc 20 btc minable token and quickly did it in 1 night
its too bad the price isnt going anywhere.
i really liked this coin because it reminded me alot of bitcoin in the old days
lmao what?
that's not true ever
This coin won't take off because its not the first ever token.
Btc is not the best coin there is.
It took off because 1 it was the first token, 2 Its fanbase was dedicated and constantly shilled it, 3 it has the brandname and it has the attention of the media unlike every other coin.
How retarded are you exactly?
