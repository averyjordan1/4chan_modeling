Can someone explain how Palm Beach Confidential isn't an elite pump and dump group?Seriously they said buy Dash up to $600.
It was $450 a few hours ago.
They are going to dump their bags when it reaches $550.
because thats what it is
What they are doing is technically illegal.
It's only a matter of time before they get rekt
Correction, no illegal with cryptocurrency, as I know.
They are going to ruin it for the rest of us though when the gov gets involved.
its not only an elite pump dump group.
It's an elite pump dump group which also makes the members pay 3 thousand fucking dollars to join it.
