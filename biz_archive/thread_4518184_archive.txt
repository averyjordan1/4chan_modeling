I dun think it's natural anymore.
Operation DragonSlayer seems to be moving right along.
BCH will moon the hardest when btc difficulty adjustment occurs.
The miners will jump and btc will potentially be locked.
The mempool spam has only fired up 25% I think this is because they want to save it for the difficulty adjustment rather than hit it now.
mempool>spam>in one sentenceopinion discarded.
Can you explain?
I'm referencing the tx spam that occurred last flippening?
all transactions are equally valid.
there is no such thing as spam.
Kek.
Transact 1$ 2 million times on the btc blockchain.. please i beg you ;).
they would have to pay a fee to do so, thus yes, it is valid.
The mempool spam is only relevant is you actually care about the 0-5 range, and only retards care about that.Keep up the FUD though, papa needs more satoshis.
They are spamming transactions.
They don't care about the fees, they ate the miners and get the majority of the money back anyway.
I think core send all the spam tx so btc is stuck.
No one can leave!
