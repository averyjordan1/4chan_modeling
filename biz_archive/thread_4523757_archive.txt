who's on board?In for 140LTC.
Finally we see breakthrough on this super stable coin, I was feeling a little left out with all the action yesterday.Today, Litecoins time to shine
Realistic target?
I'm thinking of 85-90
Really hoping 3 digits here, i feel like this coin is very undervalued
Yeah.
You ready my mind anonThough I've got a sell order in at 98 just in case any pajeets wanna send a green wick my way?
$52
Absolutely undervalued and probably the safest hold (along with monero) this weekend.Just dont want to miss out on the gains from trading BCH today
Invested on LTC yesterday before I slept cause of comfy earnings.
Feels good
