What do you think about this?
yes, Team is doing great job and quantatmap stamp implement ING good security token that also used for other ICO.they have good Dev team and team support bis awesome
Also supported by these, REQ and YCombinator
Quantstamp is quite popular in community, 30M hard cap is very decent not large one, it is good for investment.
I hope QS will be a large project in the future.
