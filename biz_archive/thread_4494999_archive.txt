Should I buy XRP?
bump
Depends on how long youre gonna hold it.
It's a solid long term hold (probably like 2-5 years)
I was wondering the same,I think it will make a new ATH, or at least will try.
If crypto is to win so will Ripple.
Almost ALL major financial institutions are in bed with Ripple to some extent.
Ripple will win.
However the token XRP may or may not win long term.
There really is no use for it and any bank can create their own "token" on top of the Ripple settlement and messaging blockchain tech.
Short term XRP token will reap the benefit of the partnerships until folks realize the token is pretty much useless.
Isn't this basically the same case with ETH?
i doubt this has potential and best case it will doublewhich in crypto is pleb returnswhy not focus on cheap and promising companies like RCN
Not exactly.
Dapps on the Ethereum network require Ether (ETH) to run (just like NEO require GAS to 'run').
XRP on the other hand is Ripple's version of settlement currency.
foe example when you make a payment instead of SWIFT messaging between two counterparties the communication happens via the Ripple blockchain tech AND instead of fiat currencies being translated you transact with the token.
The speed and benefits come mostly from the benefits Ripple tech has not the token.
You wont see any overnight 'mooning' with XRP.
You've missed that already.
However this token is a litmus test of how comfortable old money (Wall Street) is with crypto.
why would banks go through the trouble of making their own "token"?
would joe blows like me and you buy their token?
and do the work XRP already has done on it?
i honestly don't know myself, i just wonder too.
Banks wont be making public tokens for you or I to trade.
These tokens will be for backend settlements.
it takes 3-5 to settle funds on fiat through a token on the blockchain it takes minutes.
