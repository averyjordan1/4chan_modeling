Guys I'm afraidWe're having a great time laughing at linkies, but when (or if) link actually moons, we'll have to deal with these fucking bagholders spamming the site.Can someone kill Sergey to make sure this doesn't happen?
if link moons, there are going to be some interesting news stories all across the world for a few months until they all go broke.
get ready for the lambo pics
psoriasisOh linkies.
What would the world of cryptocurrencies be without you?
What do, we owe the honour.
The promise of Link seemed glimmering at first.
The premise of 'rent free' was surely innovative and ahead of its time.
But, as time showed us, this coin was nothing more than a pump and dump that inadvertently created the most deranged community of bag holders known to man.
A community that incessantly screeches "rent free" whenever they feel threatened, which is very common.
To be a linkie is to be deranged.
Having lost everything, whether it be your house, marriage, wife's sons college money or life-savings surely takes a toll on the mental serenity of a linkie's mind.
Slight threats critiquing the developers of Chainlink sets the common linkie into a state of neurosis that can only be cured by euthanasia or the eventual revaluing of this godforsaken currency.
However, once the price reaches 10 cents, the value will continue falling.
This crash will be catalyzed by the fact that thousands of wallets will be lost as a mass suicide of linkies, causing the price to dip even further.
Don't be deranged, don't be a linkie
link will only moon during a huge market bull run where everything else is mooning.
they'll be more tolerable to deal with if everyone is making money.
biz during the summer was a much more harmonious experience than it has been lately.
fucking kek
I was so close to buying at 1855 but feel like the bottom will fall out and it will tumble to 1000-1500
