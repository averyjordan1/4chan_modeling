>people are so used to btc mooning now that alts don't get ultrafucked anymore when btc moves and are starting to grow with btc or at least hold fiat valueare we in a new golden age of crypto or is it just all the people who are going to sell their alts already sold?
Anyone who's holding USDT are moving it to BTC, as well as any alts as prevention against any fallout when tether thing blows up.
This was well predicted.
for example look at ARKdespite getting btfo sats wise it's been hovering around $3-3.20 since the fork cancellation
This is the biggest shitcoin.
It never moves

Mami Tomoe from Madoka Magica.
Non shitcoins always keep their fiat valueSo when btc goes up the sats value goes downBut the price remains the same
