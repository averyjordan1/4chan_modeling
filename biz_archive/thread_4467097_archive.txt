Why do people compare their ALTCOINS to BTC and have their wallet balance showing in BTC?USD is so much easier to understand whether you are winning/losing and it's the current standard.
Because you buy alts with BTC not USD.
The USD value of BTC moves, but your buying power in BTC stays the same
Nobody is trading alt coins for USD silly fuck.
Oh, youâ€™re LINK is worth .15 cents each?
Good luck cashing that out for fiat.

Because people like this are retarded and think that somehow if you invest in alts and gain fiat but lose btc value, you're going to think you made btc profit if you're tracking USD.I track everything in USD because that's what I use to pay for real life things, and when I gain USD but lose BTC value there is no confusion on my part about the quality of investment I made.
The point is that if you're losing Btc value from holding alts, then you would have been better off just holding btc and hence would have more fiat value.
This you fucking brainlets.
Alts move 80% in a day.BTC will never do more than 10%Sure if you look at your blockfolio every hr it might feel this way but longterm alt's always have made me more money than if i was entirely in btc
