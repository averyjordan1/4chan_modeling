Since we broke ICO level today, where will this be in the first Quarter of 2018?
Any nice pajeet predictions?
18 cents
 REQ = 1/10,000th of a lambo by mid 2018.
It'll dump just below ico after the ama then slowly climb to $1 Q4 2018
yeah no, $1 is not happening, not for 3 years atleast (if it ever does)
See guys I told you hodlign was the way to go.
(I seriously couldn't be bothered to daytrade I just really didn't fucking care and I'm gonna pretend it never even went below ico)
You've looked at the roadmap?
They've already delivered this quarter ahead of schedule.
No reason why that won't continue.
$0.03 before EOY.
You guys are gonna be the new linkies.
i would see this at least .25 cent before EOY, as you know Q1,Q2 are link and REQ moon times.
1.50$ after sibosOh sorry wrong thread
