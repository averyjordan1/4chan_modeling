Crazyass coin
It's strange.
Micro-Raiden comes out before EOM and it uses RDN as a transnational currency.
Wish I'd bought RDN this morning instead of POWR
"Shut up, I'm accumulating"
sold mine at 33k sats, damn bad choice.
I remember when OMG first hit exchanges it was impossible to get a thread going about it.
People would just fud it to shit and it would die in a few posts.
selling a x100 coin at x3
this was on the top of my to do list of shit to research, did i miss the boat?
It's going to have a higher marketcap than ETHDon't be deluded.
It's a solid 2X or 3X over the next week leading up to the release but it's not going to exceed ETH.
No just buy right now at this top bit right?
They have all been tops, been trying to swing trade this for a week now.
Beast of a coin.
biz doesn't talk about good coins, now go shill link or something
I've been saying powr, rdn, sub like mantra in reccomendations threads since November 1.
Power ledger made it, raiden just starting, substratum is catching up in December.
