Wallets and exchanges, /biz/.I'm somewhat new to this and am looking for recommendations.Currently I keep my little amount of BTC on electrum and XMR (which I only mine) on the official GUI wallet.Regarding other alts, they are all on the exchange, which is that lagging shitpile of Kraken.Do you suggest a multi-currency wallet?
For now I don't feel like I need cold wallets..>Pic not related I think
Do you suggest a multi-currency wallet?I'm interested as well
