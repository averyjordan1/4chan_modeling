Do I need to spell this one out?I will anyway.3 mil circulating supply cents at the moment (that's a 6mil market cap)>Dividends>Will be using Chainlink for oracleAsk yourself anon.Why aren't you all in right now?Do yourself a favor and look at coinmarketcap and look at the coins with a 6mil market cap.See ya on the moon
I unironically pity the devs... they left so much money on the table.
They could have raised 10 million easily
There is so much potential
Pity?It was on purpose so when they don't deliver you really can't blame them
if i was in their shoes i would have just taken the 20 million of ICO and then worked on the product
bitbean at 6m market cap tho
and after researching do you think it should be worth more then a meme?thats the question you need to ask yourself.
I for one am buying a shit ton even at 15x ico.
there is easily 5x from here
cant doubt this man
I'm not all in because I had 2ETH cap.Fell asleep for the open sale.
