Modum.io has developed sensor devices, which record the environmental conditions that a package has been exposed to while in transit.
A sender can pre-program parameters into the blockchain, which enable notifications if a deviation in conditions that may affect the quality of the product has occurred.
The records are immutable and auditable, fulfilling regulatory requirements.
This passive monitoring strategy reduces the need for costly and inefficient actively-cooled transport solutions with a potential industry wide savings of 3 billion EUR per annum.MOD Tokens are backed by the business value of modum.io AG.
The recently modified EU GDP regulation requires that pharma producers and the over 10â€™000 distributors deliver evidence that temperatures did not affect drugs in transit.
This use case is an early application of blockchain technology in the logistics sector where a real, regulatory-driven market need for the technology exists.Just educating you guys.
Buy only if you like the idea :)
Shut.
The.
Fuck.
Not done acumulating.
I'll put it more simply, don't forget /biz/ is full of retards and pajeets.>EU laws say all drug should be shipped in some temperature range>no way to monitor this now so they use freezing trucks for 100% of them% of those drugs could use regular post which is WAY cheaper>Modum is there to prove the shipping was following regulations Those companies will save a shit ton of money, they are already waiting to start, Modum only needs the hardware which is being mass produced right now in NorwayQ1 2018 they'll reveal who are the customers already working with them.
Stop shilling this coin and accumulate, why are all you /biz/ tards so impatient.
