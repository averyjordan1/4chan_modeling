Stop it with this thic Ran posting now.
The value of Thicc Ran is going 50x by January
Sold half of my OMG stack during a previous pump 2 weeks ago to buy 109k REQ because I feel that since it never had an actual pump yet, and they're ahead of schedule and releasing their site in Q4 2017 instead of Q1 2018, that it'll be an easy 5 - 10x to ride.
>Sold the rest of my OMG during a recent pump to 105k sats 3 days ago to let it sit in BTC at 7.7k>Sold BTC at 8.2k to buy back OMG at 95k sats, made 111 more OMG from it.My endgame is that I'm betting on REQ going 5 - 10x quicker than OMG will, since OMG isn't releasing anything of note until mid 2018.
I'll ride the REQ pump, get out, and push it all into OMG so that I'll be filthy rich by the end of 2018.
I'm sticking to this fucking strategy.
Wanted to note, I feel comfy because either REQ or OMG or maybe even both, will make it in the long run since they both do roughly the same thing but targeted for different regions.
Right now my stack is split between the two.
I couldn't be comfier.
