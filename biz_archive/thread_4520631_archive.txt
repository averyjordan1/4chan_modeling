Never been more close to selling all my BTC for FIAT.
Tell me why this is a bad idea?
The price is nearly at ATH, and we're about to enter a shit-storm that's going to give me stress all weekend.
Possible downside:After it cools down I'll have to buy in at a (slightly) higher price?
sell it nub, its going down for a while anyways
no fag hold btc we need hodlers for the next war
Nobody went to zero for taking profit.Iâ€™ve hedged most of my positions and going on a holiday with some of my gains.
Hello Anon.
It is I, Lain.
I agree with your choice.
I don't expect this dip to be as cataclysmic as you fear though; more around $7,200.Love,Lain
sell now buy in later for more.
thank me next week
this is an extremely obviously good idea.
making it a bad idea.
What's bugging me is that everybody is completely AWARE of the plan 'bcash is executing'>difficulty will increase by 25%>all miners switch to bcash>bcash difficulty will go up bigly>but miners won't switch back this time because...>bcash price starts to be pumped towards parity>all miners will stay on because of this massive pumperoni>I lose all my moneysIsn't this too obvious as well ?
The voice of FUDIf you look at BCH now, it is going up, but it's not even a strong rise.
Don't expect this to be anything like the post fork moon or come anywhere near ATH.
It will be a small rise for a day or two, then back down again.
