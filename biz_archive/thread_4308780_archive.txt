Pajeet-tier question I know.
But we all know by now that 95% of big-coin moons are whale jobs.
Not talking about fucking 3BTC volume shitcoin on bittrex shilled by pajeet degens that are about to drop their fucking faggot discord link in this thread because they have a referral system going lmao.I'm talking about groups where triple digit BTC people congregate.
I wanna know it because I wanna leech of their info and earn enough money to "make it".
The amount I need is laughable to most, but I don't live in the states.
Getting to 5 BTC would literally mean life-changing event for me.So realistically, 2 BTC would be insanity.
I don't even have half of BTC now.
These groups probably coordinate daily or weekly and all i wanna do is tug along for some 20-30% gains...until I make it.
How do I go about this masterplan?
whalejobsIs that some new intercrural bullshit?
Check'dem.
What I meant by whalejobs is these boys organizing to pump some heavy duty coin like Neo or Lumens or whatever.
Something that can't be done by discord faggot groups that specialize in dropping bags on gullible idiots while signalling literal shitcoins.
