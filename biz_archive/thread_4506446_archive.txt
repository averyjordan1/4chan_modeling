I have this idea of a future with virtual peer to peer banking.
A kind ofdecentralized and secured system.
Gone would be the times that governmentsand banks can track and interfere with our money transfers.
Or eveninterfere with the total amount of money on earth.
My envisioned sytem wouldhave a fixed total amount of money.
But each money unit (say virtual coin)is divisable indefinitely.
So a kind of deflation would replace inflation.The total value of the money in the world would be a fixed number.
It posesno problem for liquidity, because the currency can be divided anytime.However maybe people will not spend their money much, because it's valuewill increase often.
Other problems raise in the areas of security,malicious use, and how to come towards such system from current systems?These are just ideas, I like to hear comments or about net resources on thissubject.
Fuck off scammer.
That'll never pick up
