Crypto has now reached a Marketcap of over a quarter of a TRILLION dollars.What are your thoughts at this historic moment?
sell the greed
time's running out to make it
And people were thinking 10 Billion was too much.
People just don't understand how all this affect global business and banking - it turns it upside down.
Imade a thread when it broke 213 less than a week ago.
1 trillion by Christmas.
extremely long way to go

wake up>realize i still have less than one btc
we're all gonna make italways maintain 10% precious metals though
Doesn't seem real.
What does seem real however is that my prefork bitcoin is now $200 away from $10k$10k.
THAT is the value of hodling
This screams like a bubble ready to burst
We still got time homie
Pissed that my alts have not had any of those shekels since btc hit 5k
People have said that for months.
Crypto is a game changer.
We're just getting started.
Did you think the same at 10B, how about 20B?
Did you think the same at 30B?
how about 50B?100B?
125B?
175B?
250B?
what will you think at 350B?
How about 500B?
what are you going to do when the big money markets start settling transactions on blockchains?
Will 2T scare you?
How about 10T?
missing the greatest boat ever to sail
It's the birth of a new economy.Like the birth of a star, material slowly accumulates until it reaches a critical mass and collapses in on itself, ejecting some material but leaving a stable core.
Dear poorfags.
The ecb and boj already printed 3 trillion usd equiv this year alone.
I'm all in Monero, comfy as all fucking hell
Since 2016...
Maybe it's time to start buying cryptos with potential real world applications.
trillion usd created last 10 yrs by fed/ecb/boj.
Agreed
>think how much of that is from BTC forks>money created out of thin air and added to total marketcap>totally irredeemable if people choose to cash out>castlesmadeofsand.wav
i feel sorry for those who cannot see it.
i have one friend who literally has been saying it's too expensive since $400
It's not?
The bigger the cup the more drops for flies.
It's much easier to make it to 1m in one month now than in 2011 or 2013.
There's multiple coins that went x5-x10 this month.
Same month ago.
And next month will be interesting as we cross 9-10k.
It's never too late, you're just in time.
my 0.25BTC only became 0.36 in three monthsI'm bad at this game.My goal is 0.4 by start of year and 1 whole bitcoin by april.Wish me good trading sense.
tfw started with .75>"trade" for 3 months>now have .23it sucks being a brainlet retard
rdn+sub and you'll have your 1btc by January
Went from $4000 to $1400 to now $5000, used to have 1 btc now only 0.6
doing the calculation this means ethusd will reach $10k before the dotcom style bust, this will coenicde with me being a multimillionaire
