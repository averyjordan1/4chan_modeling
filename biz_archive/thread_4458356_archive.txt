amidst all the CFD shitstorm whats gonna happen to this little fuck
Nothing... yet another token that goes down by 40-60% once I buy it.
then don't buy it please
Give it a few weeks.
This is one of the rare gems amongst all the shit on here.
I could have easily taken 2x the day i bought but i'm holding.
This has a shit tonne of potential, just bought a few K worth.
Already being used on Aus site mivote.
Long term hold though, won't moon til early-mid next year imo
That is why I don't care if a token value goes down by 50% in a few days...
It's the job of daytraders to pump and dump everything, worthless or not.
If you intend to HODL, do it for at least 3-6 months, else you will almost always lose.
I learned that the hard way the past month.True mega-moons come once the product has actual value, not before.
Bump
down 57% so far
Yep.
Problem is people describe a moon as +50% and as soon as there's a correction when the whales who got in at ico prices take a profit the plebs shout scam and shitcoin from the rooftops.
Keep the 50%.
I'm not selling til this at least goes x5 or x10.
They are safely tucked away in MEW.
Not letting them out for a while.
Not in a hurry.
POWR and HST came out more or less during the same timeand HST is far more practical both are aussie coins then why did POWR get govt funding and is getting pumped right now
Because one of the founders is in government.
It's a good project but that's pure cronyism.
