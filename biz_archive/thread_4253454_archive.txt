what exchanges are good for alts?
fuck bittrex and its fucking piece of shit enhanced verification.
As far as interface and generally doing right by their users Binance is the best I've found, but it doesn't have as big as big of a coin selection as shittrex unfortunately.
But since Bittrex robbed me of my legacy account I just use Binance for most coins and skip out on whatever pumps aren't on there.
I refuse to give a US exchange all that info.
bittrex asks for way too much shit, and a fucking selfie with my id?
really?
Poloniex, great interface and great volume.

I can still withdraw.It isn't like I'm going to able to withdraw 100 BTC worth of anything anytime soon.
