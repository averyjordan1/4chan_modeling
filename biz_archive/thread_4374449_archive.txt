This thing has a stronger resistance at ICO price, than the tuberculosis bacteria does, and scientists have been trying to break through to that bacteria for literally the longest time you can imagine in microbiologyTo break the ICO resistance wall, this company is going to have to become the gold standard of payments of crypto.
They need to become Paypal 2.0
Ae you all completely mental?
Really?
You hold a great coin for a few weeks and it doesn't make you insta rich so you are "REQT" ?
Stay poor dumbasses.
Not a single part of me bought req expecting lambos to instantly fall from the sky.
I bought 500k to hold for 6 months, maybe cash a bit then, but hold the rest for 2-5yrs.
Go ahead, sell it, play shitcoin roulette, hope that works out for you lol.
They need to become Paypal 2.0Luckily that's what they say they are.
You put like $25k into this shit?
Proof ING is invested in this?
If there is none this is a scam.
Felling the same way, I went in with over 50% of my funds thinking this was the safest way to make gains.
Meanwhile, I ignored the confido shills since expected it maybe exit scam or total shit.Now I am down 30% and have missed so many opportunities because i refuse to sell at loss.
https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@cryptobrodog/request-network-an-ambitious-coin-flying-under-the-radarscroll down to sources.
ING is backed by them, as is iexec and YCombinator.
I literally sold my BCH that i bought at like 350, right before it mooned to buy this shitfucking kill me
That's not a source anon
ING is partnered with their parent company moneytis.
youre welcome for spoonfeeding
If the ING news was fake dont you think ING would come out and reject it?
MoneytitsHonestly how would they even hear about it?
It's just on some guy's blog.
Honestly guys, you have no idea how rich you are guying to be.I will prove it.

gonna be some salty motherfuckers in here when this goes to $3-4 in 2018.
This has to be the worst scam on BIZ so far.
this, i'm hodlin till 2019 which is the best part
Have you done the mathe.
Put in the calculator either:3 x 630.000.0004 x 630.000.000And tell me of the number you are getting is realastic in terms of Market Cap.
>So fucking deluded
you're gonna ask me to kick you in the nuts for being this stupid in 2017. you could've stopped wagecucking if you would have just bought more
I have 320k right now.
How much should i even invest in this shitcoin?
I am clearly not overinvesting in a gamble.
Backed.
Lol.
Maybe invested 100k and gave them free office space for 6 months.
Hahahahahahahaahhaa.
I think you're missing the Q1 in there m8
T O K E NB U RNING
the year is 2100>after decades of use the Request Network only has 1 REQ left>it is worth $600 millioni'll be rich
You are clearly over estimates the potential of the burning mechanism, it will start high and will decrease rapdily.
And on top in depends on the network thy Volume anyway, and if you think 3-4$ is possible then even 20-50$ is possible.
$20-50 is possible
it will decrease at whatever the pace the team wants.
So the real question is: What pace of burning is the most beneficial for Request Network?
Jokes on you, I am never selling.
why is biz trying to discredit REQ?
rich old fag who cant even walk prolly will get murdered by grandkids way before that
m8 you don't understandin 2100 105 is the new 46
this but unironicallyi was literally gonna "$35 by 2024" in my next post
$35 by 2024way too conservative m8
only if you can pay the request for the regeneration treatment.
But you wont because you sold your requests at 5 cents to buy bitcoin at its all time high
m8 that's literally right now but I haven't sold anything
Discredit?
You don't understand how much competition is around in the payment sector.
Why should REQ win this race?
And just look at all these shills with their random price estimates
poorfag here willing to part with 500 bucksshould I buy?
do bears shit in the woods?
because they are releasing a working product in a few weeks and have been working with blockchain tech since 2014?
Because it's currency agnostic u dumb fucks.
It will work with any unlike bitpay and some stupid debit cards, this has even less expenses.
U guys are a bunch of dumbass motherfuckers.
so will it work with worthless African money?
If it only would be so easy.
REQ gonna be $34279532094 in an hour and you gonna be AAAAAAAAAAA
Oh dear pajeet god, look what have done to this earth.
