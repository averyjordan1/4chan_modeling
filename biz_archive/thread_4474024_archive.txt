how am i supposed to reach eight thousand dollars just for one btc?
some quick tips>buy literally anything else that's not reaching for an ath yet>aquire small bits every day>accept that you've missed the train but convince yourself that there's still hope
Bu the time said alts reach ath.
BTC will be 5 figures therefore you'll still be playing catch up.
The train has left and poorfags are being left behind.
this, the alt boom is over
You can just get a quarter or a half of a bitcoin, anon.
You just need some really strong scissors.
buy bch and and in a week it'll be worth 5btc

Do you want to be on the 21 million club?Tic toc.. tic toc..

alts don't moon hard anymore to make 8k or more.
the 21 club is the new 1%
