tell parents i have tons of money in crypto>dad wants me to tell him when Bitcoin dips so he can get in
I was thinking of saying something like that, but wasn't sure how to word it.
Too late now.
Buy him a nice car when you a rich and he will shut up.
>took my dad out for a steak dinner>How are things going?>Pretty good, been looking at houses>looks at me funny>You've not been doing anything illegal have you son?>Nope>Your job give you a nice promotion?>Nope, you know that bitcoin thing...>Yeah, I thought about getting into it, seems too risky though>Well I guess you could say my risk paid off>Hey you're young, what's life without risk at your age?
Glad it worked out for you though, you already sold I guess?>Nah, I've still got a bit left in it>Oh.
Still, it sounds like you're being responsible at least if you cashed out a large amount when it got highI love my dad.
Based anon's dadMy dad is terrible with money, and keeps telling me to go back to college instead of crypto investing.
I know he wants the best for me but me making $100,000 in under a year from $2500 apparently means nothing
2017>still cares what greedy boomers think
That's a comfy greentext.
Cool your dad is so supportive.He hasn't been a great investor.
He's made a lot of money, but, he's kept most of it in cash.
He's always too afraid to invest in anything.
I guess that's good with respect of being safe, but, he also has diminished his net worth over time because he never kept up with the rest of the country in his financial bracket if that makes sense.
Did you criticize him for being involved in cash?
get criticized for being involved in a currency that launders money, supports terrorism, and promotes drug usage.You mean USD?
