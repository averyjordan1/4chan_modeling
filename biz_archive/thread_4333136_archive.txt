Why even have a decentralized currency if everything centralizes in the end anyway?
Because at least this way the faggots with monies don't have a monopoly on making and enforcing laws + they can't bail out criminal bankers over and over by printing more money and devaluing people's life saving, while rewarding the people who stole their life savingsWe might playfully fight over much chink miners but the bankers were and will always be the true enemies we want to make unemployed
its just a meme to scam retarded libertarians that just got into politics during the trump electionanything with a free market/natural selection will lead to monopolization/centralization in the end as there will always be a winner since not everyone is as skilled or intelligent as another, like this is so obvious to anyone that isn't a brainlet since this happens in literally every field
Wrong.
ETH is the truly decentralized and our lord Vitalik will save cryptocurrency.
The market will figure it outWhether it's something like pow, pos, proof of authority, or something entirely different, we will find out in timeStill better than fiat by miles.
