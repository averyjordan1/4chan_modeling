I'm currently putting half of my monthly savings into dogeAccumulating until forever, the coin doesn't really go down that much but it hasn't had a breakout performance eitherAm I going to get fucked in the future?
Or am I essentially just storing into it and itll be the same years from now
people use it to move large amounts of coin ... it's basically pennies
Yea If i had more money I would be putting 2-3k in this.
Sadly I have all my money tied up in my farm atm.
But your going to make 3x bro dont worry.
Have fun and hold strong throughout your moon mission.
It's good because fee is just 1 Doge.
One of the best coinsIf crypto becomes implemented by the elites this will stay as a coin for kids.Also shitloads of transaction volume and stable price.
OTOH supply is unlimitedJust dont expect much gainz
i have 60 dogeam i gonna make it?
It's USD price has stayed fix as BTC has gone up.
I think that's a good sign.
It might not go up, but you're also not going to lose money I don't think.
I'm in a similar position to you waiting for the 15x pump.
literally a fucking meme coinHAHHAHAHA
There are 5 billion new ones minted every year how do you feel about this?
