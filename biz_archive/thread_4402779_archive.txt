I'm looking for a particular Anon who MAY have information regarding a shit coin called Coval.
The Anon in question posted this thread  but hasn't been seen since.
If you are around here please expound on the updates you mentioned.
I would also like to know how to access their slack because the link I clicked on said the community was deleted.
They moved from Slack to Riot.
Unofficial telegram just opened at t.me/CIRCUITSAlso, not a shitcoin.
