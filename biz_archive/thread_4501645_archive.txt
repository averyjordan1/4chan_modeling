hey guys.. so I lost nearly 99% of my initial 2 BTC and I was wondering if any of you'd like to sponsor a bit of BTC to me so I can make my way back up..
I hate having to ask this, but I've done similar in the past for others here, so who knows some of you might actually feel like helping..this is my current BTC adress: 1KP1QAwxqyBMGWYxp2KL9cNy5SUBGXP8sg
How are you going to make your way back up when your track record shows u lost 99%???
probably going to lose the little amount we give too lol
