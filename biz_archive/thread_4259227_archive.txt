I heard some rumblings on some Discord groups that Minereum is about blast off to the moon.
Now's your chance to buy in cheap!
Just a few months ago Minereum was over $10 now it's under $1.
Buckle up and lets make some money!!!
I want some!!!
Minereum is like 29 cents lmao.It needs a 70x moon mission to go back to its old all time high in USD.
Sorry for your bags anon but just cut your losses, coin is literally dead
It's literally not dead and people use the ERC20 service every day to make tokens.
This token was also the first ever self-mining Ethereum token!
