I'm almost at 1 million COSS now.
Once my accumulation phase is over i will put up massive buy walls to raise the price to over $1.
Dang that probably puts you in the top 10 in the world.
I'm at like #38 with 210k.
HOLLA
tfw cosslet, 500 coss here
I know several that are holding large amounts.
They will not even be selling at $1 because they are waiting for at least 1 year of payouts before even thinking of selling.....
I do not think there will be many of these available for sale shortly..
bless your soul for being able to put up with that shitexchange.
i would drop dead from a heart attack if i ever used it.
How do you see the top holder list?
Yes, i will not be selling for many many years to come.
Possibly never, since i will be able to live comfortably off of the payouts from my massive horde of coss.
Hot damn OP, that is incredible if true.
Makes my hard-earned 10k COSS seam measly.
I'm still keen to see it skyrocket none-the-less, and I think even my 10k will set me up nicely in the next year or two.
This shows all the wallet addresses.

So i'm guessing right now i'm, at the very least, top 20 in the world, but there is no way to know for sure.
How long before you start pushing the price?
You might be able to create FOMO single-handedly.
Timing it with the conference, updated UI, icos etc will help.
I have a strong feeling this opportunity will yield high returns within 12 months.
I sense a high chance that amazing amounts of FOMO are about to show on this one....
I have a million worthless coinsenjoy being hacked
Probably once they start pushing the new ui mock ups or when i am done accumulating... whichever happens first.
Time is running out though, that much is certain.
