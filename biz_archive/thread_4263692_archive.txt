For request network.I have a big gut feeling about this mooning before Link does.Albeit a smaller one compared to Link
And i didn't set up a sell order just yet.
I have no idea how far it'll shoot up
are you retarded ?did you check discord and chats of REQ holders ?They all just want to break even.
REQ will have a really hard time going past ICO price.DYOR, REQ isn't going to 'moon' until an actual product is out., or at least positive news.
>avatar-fag>tripfag>buys shitcoin because of "gut feelings"
Sounds like you need to DYOR instead of just talking complete shit about the intentions of the majority of holders.
You've done good anon
 REQ isn't going to 'moon' until an actual product is out., or at least positive news.Req just wont work in the current state of ethereum, 15 tx / second upper limit.
They need to wait for Plasma or make an outer layer themselves.
Making REQ really really longterm.
req already at ico priceretard
is REQ really a good buy?im planning to buy more tomorrow
Those are the literal pajeet flippers who thought they could finally buy a toilet with their ico gains.I hold 950k REQ I got from the presale and not even thinking about selling it anytime soon.
Bagholders are terrified and ready to sell cheap sounds like a good time to buy in
