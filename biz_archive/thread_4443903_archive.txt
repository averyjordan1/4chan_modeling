What does /biz/ think of Eidoo ?
Is the price below ICO ?
It's kinda fucked because BTC will die and they are basically a mist wallet + BTC at best with a supposed exchange that will be etherdelta + BTC I guess but probably with far less token variety.Considering stuff like komodo/agama wallet will likely have far more to offer, I doubt Eidoo stands a chance.
Imo it's overpriced.
hmmmmm.. Why dont you look it up u fucking faggot ?
