>You can't even get rich in crypto anymore.
There are no moons anymore, you would be better off in (((stocks)))
I 've got 5x from bitcoin cash, if I sold at the "peak" would have been 11x.
Do you really think crypto stay at 200 bn market cap?
We will go to trillions boi.
Get in the metaverse rocket now, leaving for moon in 3 2 1 ...
Crypto is still very new and there is TONS of potential growth.
Bitcoin is the first home apple computer.
I thought that in 2015 too...
Yeah, 2017 had no moons at all.
Not only that, but there are still dozens of lowcap coins that could reasonably make top 25 in a year's time.
The money is there, you just need to know how to find it.
This.
Moons are slowing down at a serious rate.
At this point the reward is becoming less worth the risk.I reckon we've a few months of potential life changing moons but from then on, why risk the chance of having valueless stock when you can make these gains in real stocks basically just as often.
You're fucking doing it wrong.
