Will joost be the first murder inspired by crypto?
I can't wait desu
I dunno given Karpales is still breathing I don't think NEETs really have it in them to go kill some scammer.
That said, JOOST probably had proportionately a shitload more chads/normies amonst his victims so might be a chance he gets necked.
