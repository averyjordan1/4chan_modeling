Tfw you will never be whale enough to organize a pump and dump of this magnitude.
How many of your got rekt going long because of FOMO?
Be honest, I very nearly did.
I regret not selling but I thought it could go to 8k first
the "whales" are the exchanges (especially bitfinex).
there's a lot of money to be made liquidating shorts by margin traders.
all of these types of price movements are done by exchange bots.
this type of shit doesn't happen in a regulated market.
soon, normies will get scammed lik this and will complain to big gubment... then it's over for this shit scam.
