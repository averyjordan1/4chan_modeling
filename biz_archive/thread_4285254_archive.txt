Ex paypal and google guys on dev team, vitalik an advisor.
Itâ€™s a solid project.
First product release by the end of the year.
The word will get out about this project and they are expected ramp up marketing before the product release.
Im thinking $1-2 by the end of the year conservatively.
What people don't realise is WeTrust is a platform for financial products, not just a dApp.
They're putting an SDK out.
I have a HUGE bag of TRST accumulated around 3000-5000.
This WILL be huge.
I saw in the slack earlier today they have sent their code for audit at two firms, will be returned by next week and launch is on schedule.
I'm actually really excited for this.
Don't get rekt buying high, any entry below 4000 is pretty safe.
I expect this to fly early next month.
SHUT THE FUCK UP I'M NOT DONE ACCUMULATING
I'm holding bags from 7500.
Coulda unloaded at 11k but got greedy.
Fuck my life.
