Is operation Dragon Slayer still going on?
What's up w/ BCH right now?Unconfirmed transactions are a bit high.
nothing will happen.
lol.
highcall me again when it hits the 100k markthen we can talk about high
Hurr Durr miners will go against profit interest and switch to BCH mining after adjustment.
Much flip
>SLUSH joins BCHlol
I'm just asking.
I don't care which way it goes as long as I can profit from it.
To profit from it I need to know which way things are going to go.
>he fell for made-up bullshit
If they are motivated by profit, the long term profits, and that means the profitability of the investments they put into their hardware, it lies in on-chain scaling rather than being cucked through users of BTC being essentially forced to use off-chain scaling due to large fees and slow transactions on the BTC chain, reducing the traffic that goes through BTC chain type validation via miners, that profit being sucked up into their offchain scaling solutions that only uses the BTC chain as a way to log the end result of thousands of off-chain transactions.So even if BCH is less profitable to mine (and we don't know what will happen until we see how far the impending BTC dump and BCH pump goes), a combined miner revolt makes sense for miner profitability.No matter how you look at it, it makes no sense for miners not to act in the interests of a flippening.
bch all the way brother will hit atleast 0.3 trust me
