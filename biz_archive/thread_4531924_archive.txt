Hey /biz/, new to crypto and only have about 4k to work with.
Is it too late to reap any real gains from the crypto market?
My friend who is an investment banker in Hong Kong is telling me that this whole cryptoboost is a giant bubble.
PS What's the best way to buy crypto in Canada?
Definitely a bubble.Highly manipulated 24/7 market.It's the wild west.Don't think any of this shit will be around in 10 years.Make money while you still can.
dont listen this retardmaybe btc pops, but eth is the future
Low % marginal trades to keep it safe.
Small gains over time = big gains.If you can make 10% in a week your getting an annual return above 700%
imo, the market is now more juicy than other.startups are getting more serious, adoption is becoming reality.
There are so many fucking bags I'm holding that I love so much, so much cool and innovative technology out there and it's comfy af to be on the ground floor of it all.
My cryptfoilio is currently roughly half and half ETH and LTC.
My friend told me to stick with the comfy coins when starting.I also have about 100$ in Substratum for the lols.
