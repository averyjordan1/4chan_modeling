Thank you, mighty dev.
Germans are our allies.
Me too OP, me too!
Feels really good man.
>mfw it's still not close to a 10 million market cap
They could have raised 15Million easily with this... and they left it all on the table.
I honestly dont think we'll ever see an ICO like this again
Continuous moon?
My pockets are ready to receive.
I believe there will be some copycat ICOs actually, we'll see.
Things like that draw a lot attention to your project, a coin trading well below ICO on the first day is a bummer.
Guy's what was the ico price in ETH?
.00014ETH
honestly how did this get so much hype behind it?it was only mentioned here a few times when the whitelist was open.
was it talked about anywhere else?
Its just the 400k Marketcap for a ICO that could easily get 10Million, its currently only at a similar marketcap as fucking Bitbean.
So I skimmed the websiteCorrect me if m wrong but can this platform be used to track a package of drugs?
If so, this could have huge gains because of the drug mailin game
It was talked about in the Chainlink slack and threads, because they plan on using link for their oracles.
That's how I learned about it.
Confido brought us back to pre August flip climate.
Thanks a million.
Holy.
Fuck.Can anyone advise on this?
Huge if correct.
I mean its literally anything you can ship, so yes
yep it can, its essentially just a third party rfid
This would be a boon to the dark net.
It takes the need for escrow away from the sites themselves and gives it directly to customer and seller.All you'd really need to have a fully functioning market would be Confido, the ability to talk to a seller, and a way to browse what they're selling.
Maybe a reputation system too...
Holy fuck
>getting investment advice from a racist frog>evaluating an investment on its drug world applications GENIUS GOD BLESS US ALL WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT
yep
