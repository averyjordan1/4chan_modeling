We know this is a joke, but you're making it seem as if you're trying to be convincing, which is only going to make people more skeptical
>no linux wallet

Dont be so serious because this is not a joke whether you like it or not.
Watch it!#4CHNallday
fuck you talking about?
I'm using linux and have the wallet installed
Desperatecoin
Everyone and his doge (literally) has its own coin today.The main idea of a currency is that everybody use it, so every time you add one you defeat the purpose of crypto a bit...
There is a better and worse cryptocurrency.
Chancoin can handle quicker, more, cheaper transactions than Bitcoin can.
Discord link doesn't work!
check these dubs guys
oh sorry, did i say dubs?
May I refer you to that xkcd comic about standards?When there already competing options, some with 10, 20 or 50% of market share, it is pointless to introduce a new one in the hope of handling everybody's use case.Just pick one if the dominant and improve it.
Chancoin is the future!
#4CHNallday

im sorry but this coin is dead i payd for 2.5ghs to make my transaction go trough today and it still took over an hourprice needs to either rise like 300% or go down a lot which is more likely because it doesnt work right now everyone thats mining is loosing money and not even little thanks for banning me from the discord tho you guys are really listening to complains and trying to fix problemsfucking niggers

gimme quads baby

cool stuff
I think it chimes non-weeb chan-culture.
Culture-jamming collage.
imo ethereum is only popular because of those backgrounds they made on homestead.
