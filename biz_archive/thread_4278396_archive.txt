I just saw 400 Neo being sold- then 300, and then 315 Neo being sold (and right before posting this 251 was just sold).
Is someone trying to dip the price?

It's someone with a bunch of useless shit coins getting rid of them while the going is good

God bless whoever did this and gave a good entry point for me
Betting everything they fell for the fake 2x scam and unloaded
They're gonna buy Nuls with their neo.
it's a good dip though, NEO has a few upcoming events in china.
Why would falling for 2x cause a NEO sell?
probably just some NEO hodler woke up from coma and just sell his bag of NEO.
People bought orders this big when 2x was cancelled.
Either they are in Asia and wanted to sell their bags / profits before the weekend (fine by me) or they dumped all of their NEO because they thought Alts would crashwith the Faux2x
1,000 NEO is nothing
