Is cocaine fun?
my bf keeps wanting me to try
It's great.
But keep an eye out.
It's a great way to ignore your problems
how the fuck is this in /biz/ that said yes cocaine is very fun
no not really.
One is too many, and one thousand is never enough.
That is cokes slogan
Larp
weed or lsd better

My first and likely only experience with cocaine was snorting it off of a naked asian strippers ass in my bed.
I didn't find it very fun and also it gives guys limp dick if you take too much.
I know a lot of girls that love it though, plus it makes their throat numb so they can deep throat like pornstars.
Cocaine powered literally all of the music in the 80s cutiecunt.
Anyhow, tell your boyfriend to make sure he does SOME KEGELS.
SAVE HIS MANHOOD AND MAKE SURE HE CAN KEEP IT UP AND PROVIDE.
HERE'S A TOWL.
BLESS UP.
Seen to many people come to ER with chest pain and other ischemic organs to do cocaine.
To big of a puss now.
Yes
This plus MDMA.
