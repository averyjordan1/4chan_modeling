Picture is showing LordKEK order book on Rarepepewallet.com.
Currently there are only 10 LordKEK's in the world, traded on XCP layer on top of Bitcoin.
They were accidentally made divisible(you can either lock your tokens as divisible or non divisible)...........so now Pepe traders are buying "Shards" or "Dusts" of KEK for ridiculous prices.
As you can see some guy is trying to buy a .016 of a LordKEK for about 4000 usd.
This is not fake folks.............MEMEs are being bought and sold at ridiculous prices.
Good day.
How do I get pepecash?
Pepecash is on XCP layer.
YOu can download indiesquare wallet and send bitcoin into that wallet.
Go to pepecash market and buy some.
Oh I forgot, TuxExchange also has Pepecash in it's exchange.
You can get it there as well.
There are over a 1000 Rarepepe cards made from artists all over the world with different rarity counts.
This is amazing
