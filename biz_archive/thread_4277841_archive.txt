Looks like whales trying to accumulate it or something.
Could be a potential pump within the next few hours.
VTR has a HUGE update coming out tomorrow.
You can verify the sources.It's going to be big like GRS.I bought a few min ago, and I'm set to ride out this one.
very low liquidity
FYI, Grs also had low volume before the upswing in late October.
Just DYOR and you can easily find yourself a win with VTR, anon...
no news broi checked everywherealso their reddit page is KEKeven GRS had more going on for it.oh and GRS is ASIC resistant and they have +30 wallets kek
Your move, anon
Found this: hmm.. looks like something might be going down lol.
might as well buy.
can't hurt.
GRS was an organized P&D, there was nothing special about GRS and no news announcementsso despite VTR coming out with an announcement I doubt it'll do anything to move the price unless a group of whales pump the shit out of it for 3 consecutive days.
last week's ATL was at 2k sats so0o0o0o0o0o0o0oo00o0o0o0o0oo0o0o0o
I can't force you to join, so you'll just have to watch from afar, tomorrow, anon :)
appreciate it dude.i've just been bized so much i can't take it anymore
sorry to hear that bro.
i've been bized before too.
i try to not go on pointless coins with nothing coming up, but here is a rumor apparently.
im gonna go for it.
also i doubt the announcement would make a difference when BCH is pumping and everyone is fudding BTC and 2x
Fuck the whales I'm in OP
VTR seems solid.buy the rumor sell the news
