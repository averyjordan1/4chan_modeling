If Warren Buffet was born in the 90s, he'd be the exact kind of guy that would invest in Bitcoin and crypto in general.
The problem is when you get older you acquire more cognitive biases due to your own experiences, the irony is old Warren Buffet wouldn't have become rich, he's rich because of the decisions young Buffet made.

When he's worth 70 billion fucking dollars.
that means he did it for the lulz, not the $
keki dont think i would give a slightest fuck about crypto if my net worth was 80billion btfo buffet
I can't afford NOT to.
Which one is more likely to still be around in 2050.
Bitcoin or USD?I'm honestly leaning towards Bitcoin and USD being gone or replaced by something else by then.
