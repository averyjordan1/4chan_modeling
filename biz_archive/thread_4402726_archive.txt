WHY WON'T MONERO MOON REEEEEEE
Monero is a slow beast.
didnt it moon only a few days ago
Yes, yes it did.OP, why would Monero moon right now?
There is no trigger for it, just be happy with the very stable 120USD price right now.

literally one week ago we all reeed about it never leaving 85 usd and here we are now
$200 very soon.
How likely is $1000 Monero at any point in the future?I see it as very possible but im just wondering if im deluded
Very.
Only a 6.5 million XMR circulation for the ultimate privacy coin.
It's a certainty.
It will happen the moment you realize you should have bought more at 100$
not renamed to moonero that's why

You can buy with cash money on Kraken.
