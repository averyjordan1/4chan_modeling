When some bitcoiners were migrating to Ethereum forums and saying they're done with the bitcoin infighting?
If this gets ugly could the start of 2018 be a ridiculous mass migration to Ethereum from core bitcoiners who refuse to let bch have the last laugh?
Ethereum is the future.
BT= butt trumpet
glad to see that I wasn't the only one disturbed by Alan Kohler reporting on ETH the other night
That's what will happen after the flippening is over, yes.
BCH will eat BTC, then BCH will bleed over to ethereum once it's clear BCH has peaked in the post-flippening.
"Institutional investors" are also likely to steer clear of having large holdings of BTC/BCH from now.
ayyIt's my boy Alan Kohler
Bitcoin more like Buttcoin amirite
fine by my, I have the majority of my crypto in ETH anyway
