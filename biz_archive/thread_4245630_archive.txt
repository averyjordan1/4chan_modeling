none of you are trustworthy individuals, in fact, what makes you think I’d risk my own dollars following your schemes, /biz/?
don't then
You shouldn’t.
Following /biz/‘s advice is an awful idea
Yeah.
Definitely don't invest in $NULS not like 4chan has ever had the scoop on ANYTHING
Trust is fickle and relies on the goodness and morals of people's character.
It's easily broken.Mutual self interest though, now that's something I can invest in.
i shilled CFD and NIO today.
if /biz/ listened right when I made the call, im personally up 6000$
what's next m80?
Whats next bro?
NULS?
x amiright?
I want to invest in BTC myself, not a huge amount, like $1000.Need advice, but like OP says, not sure if /biz/ is trustworthy, for no other reason than the general 4chan thing of being a load of anons with differing opinions.Price is rocketing right now, but heard about SegWit2x "around Nov 16" and not sure whether to hold out or jump on.
Might just throw $100 or $200 in for now and see what happens.
Don't ever listen to /biz/.
/biz/ tells you to buy high and sell low.
I have seen people on here say>it's too low to buy right now???
?
