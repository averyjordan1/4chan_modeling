Told you.
Where you at ARKbois.
Cant see you from the moon.
Yeah fucking Arkfags trying to shit on Lisk at any moment they get.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.
Trade those gains for eth now and enjoy the next pump
how high can lisk go in 24 hoursI feel like we are getting dumped anytime now
I'm still holding Digibye, the bags will be the death of me.
Is it too late for Lisk?
Yeah no.
Even though i have faith in Eth im not going to do shit while this childporn shitstorm is going on.
Long term Lisk will rocket to space.
On November 22nd they are presenting their new Rebranding.
Id say wait for a dip in the next days and youre good.
Don't worry.
The Lisk pump will fail (like it did earlier this year) and the money will flow into Ark (like it did earlier this year).
The trick with these cycles is to play both sides and pick an exit that's as good as your entry.UNREALIZED GAINS AREN'T REAL.
You're joking right?
If you look at the charts Lisk pumps higher everytime then dumps and consolidates until the next ATH
Just bought 80 LSK did i do gud
Lisk being above ARK in marketcap is literally what gives me faith in my long hold position in ark.As long as Lisk is still above it, ark has a lot of room to grow and a lot of market cap to absorb.. there is nothing Lisk can do that ark can’t and there is a 1000 things and growing that ark will be capable of that lisk won’t be
That 88 lisk is gonna be worth $8000 in two months.
So that should be easy for you to play, then.Sell the peak and wait for the retrace.
