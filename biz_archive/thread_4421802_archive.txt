SUCH A CUTIE WOJAK, AND PRICE IS ABOUTO EXPLODE AGAIN.
SUCH A WASTE OF LIL WOJEEK.
nobody cares about your lunch money

Repeat after me: "Buy high, sell low",that's the way we roll.FUD the pumpso, the coin I'll dump.The Lambo I lust,but the wallet JUST.Short the bull,long the bear.Leverage for lull...Dreams into thin air!Even a tiny drop and I fold!No rebounce to my weak hands..."Trend's changing!
Set the strong hold!

It forever descends...The whale is Yellow,the dollar is green.Pink Wojak fellow,hold this bag you're so keen.
