Hey /biz/,new tard on stocks/shares.Just invested in stockpile as my training ground.How screwd am i?
also amature stock thread!
Why would you not just buy bitcoin instead of that normie investment trust
Dude what are you doing.
Go buy bitcoin (or bitcoin cash for bigger gains) on a real exchange).
Get your shit together
no idea how bitcoin works, do i need a broker?
im 22, flat broke I work a minimum wage job and most my income goes to living expenses need something on the side, can you guys help me?
like honestly how does bitcoin make sense to you?makes me want to kill myself reading this shit.
makes no sensible point whatsoever>happy with 5% quarterly mutual fund gainsI’m up 3000% in the last year, how about you?
Research the coins posted on biz and dump them after you see gains.
Don’t be an emotional dipshit and get your paper man!
