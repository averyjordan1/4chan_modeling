I have $5000 and plan to save $200 per month.
Where should I invest?
Are robo-advisors a good idea?
Maybe cryptocurrencies?
Any advise would be appreciated.
Thanks!
robo advisors aren't terrible place to get started, think one of them manages the first 10k for free if that promotion is still around.
otherwise you can get similar results by buying the same ETFs yourself and skip over their fees.crypto is essentially gambling, it can be fun but no one who isn't profiting from more people buying up the price is going to tell you it's a good idea.
Just curious, where do you invest your money?
