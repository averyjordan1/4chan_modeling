Biz always give bad adv--
If you bought anytime after the ICO you're retarded
Buy from ED after ICOAnon, I...
A lot of tokens get dumped by devs as soon as hey get released that's why no one buys icos anymore.
For example enjincoin hst etc.
Well, I was also one of the FUD'ers but sadly I have to see being right for the wrong reasons.
Didn't see it coming like this.
Crypto is cruel.
Confido never dropped below 2,5x after ICO (until now) and topped at like 25x.It was a shitcoin, no doubt, but a profitable one if you knew when to sell.
Just like 98% of coins out there.
This advice was bad.
