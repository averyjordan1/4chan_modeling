Does any one else margin trade on poloniex?
I've been making an absolute killing these last few days
I'm watching XMR right now.
Waiting for it to make a move.
So many big walls on both sides
I want to get into margin trading but I am still cautious.
Can you tell me a little bit more about your endeavors?
Take it from me anon, I have 40 btc now, I attempted margin trading many times, and even if you get gains you shouldn't do it.
Your trading psychology changes, and it's very easy to get really tilted and get completely liquidated.
I've lost 10 btc margin trading, I now know it is gambling and not worth it.
Surely there are times where something is absolutely pumping/tanking and margin trading should be preferred?
if it seems like it could go either way/ any uncertainty, then don't leverage it
