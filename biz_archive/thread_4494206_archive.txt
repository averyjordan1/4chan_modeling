So when this Bitfinex and tether scam crashes BTC what will it mean for BCH or crypto in general?

Brainlets...When Tether crashes people will either a) sell into fiat, b) sell into top-tier alts (XMR, ETH, DASH, etc) or c) hold.
If enough people choose option C then BTC will pump.
Lel there is no scam.
I bet you didnt even bother to read their website.
Tethers are backed by usd reserves 1:1.
Pathetic FUD desu
Drop everything in monero and sit tight
Sounds reasonable, some top tier alt could get a pump
I think we lose all value in our crypto portfolios to be quite honest
