guys , is it normal for bitcoin users to do bank verification ?it seems everyone is asking for it .
nobody...
Its either that or deal with random guys in shady ally's.
Bank verificaion is mandatory on Coinbase, the most popular Bitcoin exchange in the world
if you want to buy btc through your bank account then yes.They have BTC ATMs now that you can buy from with just SMS verification, sometimes the fees are higher though.
Pro tip: name and address verification happens in the background of all online transactions with Visa, MasterCard, etc.
Double pro tip: avoid the inevitable delay when buying crypto by calling the 1 800 number on the back of your card while you have the transaction Ray to go on your end and verbally authorize the transaction while it happens with the representative or expect delayst.

Shady alleysHave them meet you in a bank lobby.
Cameras, in public, ability to immediately deposit cash means limited risk.If they won't meet in a bank lobby there is probably a bad reason
