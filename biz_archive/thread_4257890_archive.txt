Is the current price being propped up by bots/whales?
Look at the order book on Binance
dude it's just a coincidence what are you talking about
Of course.
Bots are manipulating all coins on all exchanges.
take this post down nwo
Not a single financial market would be successful without manipulation.
Wouldn't it be smart to sell now and wait for them to pull support to buy back in?
Yeah as long as it's manipulated on my favor I won't complain
unless getting caught was part of their plan
Or maybe they were expecting you to think that catching them was part of their plan
Fuck, man.
I just wanna buy in at 2600 sats
Cut your link losses and get in nuls now.
you will recover!
What did they mean by this
Price has dropped and these 333 buys reappeared.
I'm selling and buying back later.
No way this doesn't drop more.
I suggest you guys do the same if you want to increase your holdings.
