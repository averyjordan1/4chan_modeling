Noob to this board, not even sure where the noob thread is.
Will delete if this is duplicate.Is coinbase okay?
Their fees seem kind of steep, but I'm not sure.Looking to get into ETH.
Okay to do that on coinbase?
Yes
DOnt shift coins around to muchSteep feesif you are new just buy eth or bit coin and sit on it while you lurk the board and learn
Should I worry about another btc-e or mt gox incident with these new exchanges?
They seem more legit nowadays and less sketchy af.
Fees are only 1.99% if you buy using a bank account in the USA.
Yeah but the ACH transfer takes 5-10 fucking days by which time my buy order could be fucked.
Only with bitfinex, stay away.
Without going into too much detail, they are creating money out of thin air to manipulate the market.
My other advice is to not take any advice from people here, they are retarded and want to meme you out of your money.
I only come here to watch other people shitpost about crypto lol.
Your buy price is locked in the instant you place the order.
The actual transfer time doesn't change how much you spend.
Buy ETH from Coinbase.
Then transfer to Poloniex and trade.
The coinbase fees are steep and it sucks ass, but it’s one of the easiest/quickest ways to buy in.
So I can buy coinbase and transfer ATH to an external wallet???
Didn't know that!
Fucking awesome
PoloniexFucking lol.
You are CUTE
Use app called Revolut to change to € for free.
Use € on CB for NO FEES.
Weird, without /biz/ I don't think I would have made anywhere near as much money as I have this year off of crypto.
Yeah there's a lot of bullshit but you get to the point where you can tell the bullshit from things you should actually consider with just a glance.
Hell, I made $20k just off of LINK, and I never would have gotten in on the presale without those being passed around here.
>buying at ATH>says he is a noobWell duh
