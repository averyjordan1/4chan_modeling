Whats the 'deal' with BTG?
Shitcoin
Shitcoin, like btc.
Better than Bitcoin Cash.
doesnt it have the characteristics of bitcoin + can be mined by smaller scale users?
thats good right?
buttrex still wont let us have it our btg
The idea is great, but without mining cartel support it will end up being shitcoin or one time P&D most likely.
It will likely do well when there is another play off between btc and bch due to miners.
its gonna smash both btc and bcash.
just use logic
They duplicated the blochain like a month ago, and yet it's still a while until they actually release the coin.
That's a huge warning sign - that means that they probably haven't even finished the software.Terrible project with terrible management.
Shitcoin.Even Chainlink has a proof of concept.
it's because they were premining it retardProblem with bitcoin gold is not the original idea, that part I likeit's the super terribly shitty devs
