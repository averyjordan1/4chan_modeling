EPY starting to pump again on ED.
It's still a good time to enter.
Exit at .0002
Not a bad exit point, but it was just found out in the telegram that there is only 5 million in circulation rather than 15.
15 is total supply.I'm thinking .003-.005 but we'll see.
yeah - bought in at 10 cents.total EPY available = 7.34Mcurrent price still only gives it a 1.673M valuation, so this has a ways to go.
