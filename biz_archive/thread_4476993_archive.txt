Do I really have a memefolio?
:(Every time I post in a blockfolio thread, somebody tells me I have a meme portfolio.
I didn’t just put all my money in memes d-did I?
To be fair, I had ark and neo before I even knew biz was a crypto board.
If you think it’s trash, post a suggestion to rebalance.
Atleast you have odn
more xmr & ark

Neo is trash>muh Chinese government
More ODN devs are delivering.
Memes are only memes until they are not
don't let your memes be dreams
Your portfolio is literally all that is being shilled on biz.
hope your staking yer ark, friend

I'm not posting my bitfolio on here anymore, I think coinbase guys come here to dox clients and do shit to your account.
They could know just by looking at my exact amounts.
They shut down my ability to purchase crypto through them.
good thing I found out about coinmama and got my ass verified.
Back in business!
