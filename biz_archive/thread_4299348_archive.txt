pic relatedHe might have btc but does he have bcash?
If he does everyone should go into alts or Ethereum for time being maybe litecoin too, that way he really didn't win right?
What does /biz think?
If he has over 9000 btc, he might have 1:1 ratio of BCH from the fork.
Think before you speak, anon.
If people still have btc by this moment, they are doomed to loose everything they had.
