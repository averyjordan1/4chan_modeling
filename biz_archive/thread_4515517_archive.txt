Can anyone explain whats going on with monero?
Today has been insane.
FOMO, mostly.It should correct soon and then continue its steady climb upward
thissmart money sold already and is gonna buy back in with the correction
Good luck getting back in.
The "smart money" OVERSOLD and now its headed back up.
PnD litecoin, tthen PnD Dash, then PnD xmr, then PnD BCC then buy Bitcoin...
Didn't you get the memo?
this is how korea does crypto.
it's amazing how many bagholders they keep taking money from with this simple tactic
Zoom out to the 1d chart and you'll see the pattern.
It's not rocket science.
I see a cup forming a handle.
It wont dip below .01875 for 2-4 days and then see another sharp increase
Agora market is going to start accepting monero soon.
And the globee thing!
XMR gaining attention, people unsure about btc/bch, anticipation of being accepted in more exchanges/darknets
