Taken from the top post at r/btc right now:https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7csoxe/confessions_of_a_core_supporter/Nobody is chocked at this...
corecucks are fucking beta bitchboys who want crypto to be as regulated as the stockmarket, bet you have never gone against your wifes word either
please tell me what privacy features BCH will have
So far it's been focusing on actually being able to transact.
Sorry but BTC has superior privacy features, if you are unable to conduct a transaction, it wont be permanently added to the blockchain so no one will be able to find out about the transaction you attempted.
wow you changed one parameter.well since bcash wont have lightning network it will be less private
If you put a transaction out into the mempool it's public knowledge already.
yeah whatever corecuck
yeah thanks for confirming there are no privacy features on bcash
R/btc is more cancerous than r/bitcoin and that is really saying somethingYou should honesty just stay off reddit completely for crypto information
