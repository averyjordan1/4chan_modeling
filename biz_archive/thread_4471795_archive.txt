POWR
fake
Idiot.
I saw that on Friday, bought some, and am sitting comfy.
You people are retarded thinking its PWR or SLR.
Teeka does research unlike you who just try to guess what Teeka has researched.
Research them and find out that SLR is nothing but a dump coin, not suited for investments and that PWR is overvalued piece of shit that will get no usage whatsoever.
You know how fucking niche solarpanels are?
Even Tesla had to install those fuckers for free to get people to start using them.Im telling you this for your own sake.
if you're holding them sell off now.
Forget Teeka and dedicate this time to actuall research or trading, or doing something productice with your time cause right now you're gambling and you're not doing a very good job at it aswell.
Btw.. unless you pay someone that is subsribed to teeka you won't get that info anyway.
People pay 3k for this shit, you think they will share it with 4chan unless its to their own benefit?
Aka when they already accumulated?
Only thing I could imagine is that SLR will at somepoint allow holders to get a discount (since they are given away essentially for free) but wtf are you gonna invest in loyatly points at your local supermarket?
I hope not or you're dieing for that new collection of forks and spoons that some dude in sweden coughed up in 15 minutes.Get a fucking hold of that greed and be patient for once.
This market moves in a fast tempo and you still can't wait even a fucking day.
As if this Teeka guy will make you rich, he won't.
You will make him rich cause you're buying the preaccumulated coins that he and his sheeple bought and in turn gets Teeka more subscribers cause OMFG 4chan keeps buying this crap.
