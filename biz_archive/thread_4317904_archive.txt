After some advice.
Should I put $100 a week into Bitcoin for 10 weeks, or wait 10 weeks and put $1000 in?
Does it make a difference?
Thanks
unironically bitcoin cash.
bitcoin is dying
Shut the fuck up, no one wants your pump and dump shitcoin.
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
When youâ€™re actually retarded
