Hey, new guy here.
How do I read an order book properly
buy high sell low
Just watch it for an hour and you'll be able to figure it out.
People have buy order wanting that an certain amount of that asset for a price, people have sell orders wanting to get rid of it at a certain amount and price.The buyers have to buy it at the price the lowest seller is willing to get rid of it for, or a seller has to sell where the buyers want in.
It's just people bidding for what they want to buy/sell an asset for and the order book shows the amount and price people are willing to do it for.
You don't, it's all bots and manipulation 95% of the time
