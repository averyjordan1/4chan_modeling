I’ll start with admitting I’m not the brightest when it comes to working with numbers.
Code and development I’m fine.I thought I was winning the Alt game but scalping profits against the price of usd.
Instead of looking into my original satoshi buy amount I was selling for as low as $200-300 lower than I bought in because bitcoin had dropped.What do you trade against only satoshi’s to accumulate more bitcoin and ignore the dollar?What do you do to make sure it’s a profit not a loss chest your original buy in amount against Sats or USD?Do you recommended blockfolio or other software?Is your game plan to collect alts at a BTC ATH and then scalp when bitcoin has it’s dips?I’m a fucking retard
