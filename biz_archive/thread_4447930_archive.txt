I have atypical autism (PDD) and was just planning my budget for 2030.I need to take the mean of your guys estimates for my net worth on 01/01/2030 in USD (no round number amateur guesses please).Then I can factor in confidence limits, macroeconomic trends, uncertainty variables, etc.
But if I don’t get the estimates my plan is broken, I will be very upset if I don’t get them

damn I just got autism from reading the OP's post
okay op I guess your networth will be 21231231242344235421325341q3234323$ hope that helps your autism
/19/17(Sun)17:25:512030That's only 56 mins away; you can pretty much use the same budget as you did for 1930
Thank you, but you did not define ‘q’you are retarded, probably more than me, if you can not interpret my request implies a long timeframe.
The way the question is framed would allow most people to infer 2030 is a year.There is definitely something wrong with you sorry
nigger, no one here can predict what their crypto net worth will be in 12 hours, let alone 12 years
