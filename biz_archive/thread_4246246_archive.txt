Sergey's weight is inversely correlated to LINK price.
How do we get him on a diet?

God damn have you guys seen those shoes?
Just screams out "I'm a pathetic virgin"

Since the price suddenly recovers everyday, is this the moment he takes a dump?
kek
Just like the LINK token runs on ETH, Ethereum needs link for real world adoption.This yin-yang relationship needed to be shown irl by their creators.
So they created the Skelly-Belly.
So for Crypto as a whole to be successfull, Link and ETH have to fuse together?Sergey has to eat Vitalik?
It's inevitable
I always suspected that someone ate, and later shat out Vitalik.He turned from money-Skelly to twitter-commie piece of shit.
ThisSomeone buy him some Aj breds
he ate our gains, I knew it!
At least we know where the ICO money went.
Seriously, Sergay should put more time into LINK and less time in fast food.
kek that was good
