Why is IOTA dumping?
Is the money moving to XMR/ETH/BCH?I thought it was going to reach $1 again.
Can someone please pump it ;)
Pull back the chart to a 6 month chart and relax.
You are welcome.
It seems to rise and fall with BTC these days.
IOTA is the shittiest of shit coins
I have long open and I am getting liquidated at 77 cents.Currently at 85 cents.
I am still hoping for a sudden pump.
Would settle for a small loss or getting even.To be honest I really thought that adding to OKEX would give it a little push to $1 and then it would dump.
Instead it started dumping before it even got listed.
WTF?
cents.
bounce, you fucking piece of shit
it bounced i went long on 81 cents
Back to 81.
Hope you managed to get something out of this mate.
I think it's too late for me :(
It's a broken shitcoin, a scam
I hope this dumps hard, so I can finally become a GIOTA club member.
it could find support and bounce up
yes, have the same hopes.hoping it dumps to 0,5 or lower

"thought it would reach $1" - you must have confused it with TIO,lol.
TIO is definitely going to reach $1 an above in no time.
only 450000 tokens.
Get on the train now: 
One day when your toaster pimps you out to your refrigerator for 22 Miota, you'll regret saying that!
David said 90% of IOTAs announcements for 2017 are coming now in December, feeling comfy.
The sooner the better.
Preferably right now.I really don't want to become pink wojak
hey pajeet, it's still November.
Come over to XMR, OP, it ain't done mooning and it sure is /comfy/
I bought some Monero at 50.
Feeling comfy.This was suppose to be some extra money to put into XMR.
And now I'm paying for my greed.
