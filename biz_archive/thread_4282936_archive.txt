This thing is always the first to drop and it drops the hardest.
Why?
With the partnerships they're reeling in..
I don't understand why there isn't more hype.
Thinking about dropping my bags.
Shill me on this coin or encourage me to drop it.
No one?
:(

fuck your thread lolsaged
Volumes are still too low for this shit that's why catch it when it bottoms at 8-10 cents and you won't have this problem
why so mean
But I'm already in.
Should I hold my bags?
Yeah hold those fuckers it will pay off.
I held vertcoin for a long ass time (4 months) and I made 12x recently.
Good gains are worth waiting for and this project is a winner.
Thanks anon
