How is it possible that out of all the shitcoins, Bancor is the only one to never moon.
Whales dont even touch it, pump groups dont touch it, why?
because of their platform?it can't be pumped (or dumped)
I'm not gonna pretend to know the tech entirely, but from what I understand its designed to prevent rapid rises and falls in it's value.
It's also been like a tranquilizer dart to ETH.
I'm sure ETH would be between $500-1000 by now if a large number of them hadn't have been pegged to the Bancor Protocol.
wait, you're saying the jews are what fucked up ethereum?
wtf are you serious?
hpow does this work?
Bancor literally destroyed ICOs and altcoins for good.
The day it was released was the day the alt bubble popped, july 7th, check the charts
read white paper.
you buy bancor directly from them.
she makes my d*** moon

I really hate the jews man
Don't post about bancor if you don't understand it (most of you itt).
No I will not explain it on here again.
DYOR and don't believe everything posted here.
These tokens https://www.reddit.com/r/Bancor/comments/75b7us/list_of_all_known_projects_committed_to_using/ and all the big ERC20s will be listed by end of year.
Hundreds next year.
No other eth ico has released as much as bancor.
