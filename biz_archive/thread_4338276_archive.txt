> 'Conductor of the poop train' — Shill the whole biz into buying into an ICO> 'Left behind' — Miss out the ICO of a coin you've been actively shilling> 'Puppet master' — Make /biz/ lose their minds after posting one moderately imaginative postI find it extremely amusing how /biz/ is easy to manipulate.
You can post a rumor about LINK and will spread like fire until Rory moves his fat ass to deny it.
You can find a mildly promising coin, and the next moment bizraelis pump it x10 just to dump it hard once the realisation kicks in.Too bad I'm too scared to follow my own advice as I see how wrong in the root it is.And I tell you: you can listen to /biz/ only to check if the community realises the pitfalls and opportunities you see.
Do not listen if somebody tells you directly to sell/buy smt.
