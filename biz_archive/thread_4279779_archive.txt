Why the fuck are you guys not balls deep in MNX?They started trading on Livecoin a week ago, and the price is constantly rising, it jumped to rank 71 on coinmarketcap.Also you can park your purchased MNX at the also newly started Minexbank, where the creators of the coin pay you 6.1% interest weekly atm.They also have a mechanism included to ensure a stable growth of 30% yearly while reducing random volatility.
Target price of that mechanism is about 20$ by EOY, while currently sitting at about 5-6$
Bump, correct interest rate is 6.3% weekly
Shh I am accumulating
Well, I warned you, price just went up to 9.30$
