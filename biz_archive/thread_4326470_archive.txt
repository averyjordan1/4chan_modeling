Do any of you know how to scrape price data from TradingView?It's delivered through a websocket as a sequence of binary packets and then rendered to a canvas.
I have no idea how to capture and decode the raw binary data though - any ideas?
you do know they got api's for that right?
for real?
I thought they only share their charting library - not their data
anyone?
