EDO.
Do your own research, I already did enough for you fags by awaring you.
But it hasn't mooned yet, biz won't buy it.
any rumors there or announcements coming up?
of course they wont buy it.
they're busy chasing coins that already pumped at their ATH and stuck bag holding.
I do know there are some smart people out there who already bought this without me having to mention it.
yup.
im in it.
also in CFD and NIO.
smart crew reporting in.
Yes partial exchange release Q4
CFD is good too, don't know about the other one though.
EDO is my top pick of course.
Seeing this get posted a lot, went all in don't let me down biz
I'd had EDO on watchlist for a while, the sudden increase in shilling on /biz/ pretty much confirms there'll be some kind of moonmission imminently.
