Say I want to cash out my buttcoins for some fiat in the UK, what options do I have?
Who has the best rates?
Bump for interest.
Cuckbase won't let you withdraw to gbp.
selling right before the moon mission
I've used then previously by withdrawing in euros, but I think I'm getting jewed with their feesI don't plan on getting out just yet, this just seems good to know
Best rate: Coinfloor.
Full KYC required.
No trading fees.
Â£15 fixed withdrawal fee to a bank account in your name.
Have fun getting blacklisted by your bank though.Other than that: Localbitcoins.
Good rates, random money transaction from anon.
No KYC.
yeah manipulated moon mission by tether
You can't cash out bitcoin.
You have to buy things with bitcoin.
I don't care as long as it moons.
I just stay the fuck away from tether and hope it won't crash the market to hard once its time is up
you don;t want to be trying to cash out via localbitcoins during a crash though.
apparently Fidor bank are quite accomodating with crypto.
they're a German bank but they do UK accounts now.
I play on cashing out from an exchange to my account there, don't want to get fucked with by my regular bank.
UK banks arent this hot on it are they?So they let you make payments to crypto but not withdraw?
Been cashing out with bitstamp via sepa transfer since 2014, no issues and done very quickly.
The other poster taking about blacklisting with your bank is talking shit.
