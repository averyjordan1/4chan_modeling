seems good but it wont go up right after ico i will buy when it tanks
It's already way below ICO price on ED.
It will go up after it hits exchanges not down.
how to buy?
Using the super secret ED link https://etherdelta.com/#0x017188526374f723ec66509ea0c44dd797a33c84-ETH
Fuck, i need ETH.
It'd be lovely if these exchanges let me use USD directly
Yea it's a bitch.
wat exchange will this be listed?
HITBTC and ED in a week.
Hopefully some more later.
To add here's a pic of ICO price.

Cindicator actually was a scam since there's no reason to use ERC 20 tokens on their platform.
Why couldn't they just use money?
FENX actually makes sense since you would want to use a secure payment system if you were to pay for torrents.
