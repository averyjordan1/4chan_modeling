iÂ´ve realized that the first main reason i wanted to start on business and money related stuff is because the social insecurity of being discrimated by your economical position, you know the need of being socialy accepted just bc you have money.
but now that im conscious about it i dont really care about it anymore, but there is something that is still there whith just a little change, and is the fact that im still balls deep into the business stuff but with a different reason, i just find the game exciting as fuck and i want to keep myself on it because of that and not the personal insecurity.
and something better is that actually im enjoying so much more working in general not only in crypto because before my main motivation was just making money for fullfilling my insecurity now its just having fun playing this crazy grown men game once i have made enough for a decent living.
i would resume this like realizing that the peak isnt important but the road.
