So the people of biz should try to research coins and determine their potential instead of relying on the shilling and PnD signals on here.
So many of you got fucked by the pajeet Teeka Masala earlier.
As I am feeling kind today, I am giving an early tip off for a particular coin which is very likely to be used in the NEX decentralized exchange just announced by NEO.
The coin in question is LRC (Loopring).
DYOR and you will find in the NEX whitepaper there is a very very subtle reference to LRC, indicating a partnership between the two in the near future.
Furthermore you will find that Da Hongfei is an advisor, and a bittrex listing is incoming for this coin next month.
Not shilling, just motivation for doing your own research
