Made a thread earlier but fell asleep-I've made about 800k in crypto since May.
I keep 500k in my portfolio and cash out everything above that (since who knows if this is a bubble).I've quit my job (making 110k a year), told my boss I was going to graduate school as not to piss him off.Trips decides where I go traveling and what I do there.Give me something good biz
Go anywhere and help poor people
thailand and fuck underage hookers
asia bro.
spent half of last year bouncing around there.
dirt cheap, nice beaches, lots of backpacker sluts.
hit up thailand, vietnam, bali, philippines, taiwan, japan, etc.
god dammit its fun there.
I've been around Asia, I like the hookers.
Looking for something a bit more outlandish but not dangerous.
Was thinking India.
Come to the netherlands bruh and lets fuck all the hookers on the redlight district while we do legal drugs on our hotel room with 10/10 blondes
How did u make it?
day trading or smart hodl investments
if you want some top notch hooks hit up artemis in berlin or showpark in prague.
if you wanna push it check out colombia or bolivia
Trips decides where I go traveling and what I do therei always wanted to see the aurora borealis
lisbon portugal or barcelona spain if u have money the game will come to you there
someone making $110k a year would be smart enough to know they can't quit a job making $110k a year just cause they made $800k which is just going to get fucked by taxes when you try and move it
I inherited a lot of money too.
I'm just kind of "over" working.
