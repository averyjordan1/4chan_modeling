Any ideas regarding when they're going to launch their lending platform for some EZ gainz?
Their website says Q4 2017, but we're starting to approach that limit, and it'd be nice if anyone had some info about a more specific time.
Team consistently answers "Q4 means until December 31"Still a very comfy hold and everyone should get as much as possible.
