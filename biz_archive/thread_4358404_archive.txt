I would assume most ALTs will temporarily crash if the flippening happens since they're connected to bitcoinI should sell all alts, right?
atleast until this war is over
Yes, buy them cheap too when they're all still denominated in a flailing BTC
Yes, fiat is safest until after Roger makes his move with that 45k of btc.Buy the alts for bargain prices at the bottom from panic sellers that didn't go to fiat early.
LTC, DASH and XMR each have a scaling proposition similar to BCH.If BTC goes on to tank more due to scaling issues, I believe all of these coins will see gains against BTC.Maybe weâ€™re headed to a market without a clear top dog store of value.
Would be interesting.
not LTC, the creator is CORE's good boy and a small block(dick) maximalist.
remember boys moon mission tonight over and out
Mate the whole crypto market would go into a bear market.
Think about the normies that bought bitcoin from the 5-7.8k run.
They'll be left with peanuts because they bought the core chain.
Every media outlet will jump on this to smack the fuck out of bitcoin.
New money is dumb but not dumb enough to risk investing in a speculative asset which could dump to 10% like the flippening would do.
