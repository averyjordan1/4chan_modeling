What do you think about Storj?
It was mentioned in PBC, buy up to $1.
It's at 70 cents now, bouncing from 8700-8900 sats.
The project reduces cloud pricing costs by half of Azure and ASW.
It's all decentralized and thus more secure.
But fuck all of that.
PBC mentioned it.
And the price is still only less than 6% up from what it used to be before PBC mention.
Really want to buy right now.
What do you think /biz/?
are you sure?
i thoght the whole difference between this, and siacoin, is that siacoin is decentralized and storj is centralized
did they had any news today at the community meeting?
I think it is a good buy if you wait for a little dip
No.
Go to their website.
It is completely decentralized.
Even Vitalik praised the project.
I don't know about news, but it seems like a good buy.
Might buy more if there is a Thanksgiving dip.How important do you think the PBC mention will be in predicting the next couple weeks?
its good for the price also pnd groups love teeka coins
Seems even more tempting now.
Especially since price is so stable.
