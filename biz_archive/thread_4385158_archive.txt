i always wanted one of these, but they are absurdly expensive.
I've considered trying one out but the local place charges 60 bucks for an hour
I could do the same shit in my tub with a bunch of magnesium salt.
You might as well get a hooker.
my joe rogan fanboy friend has recommended it to me, and theres a float centre about 5 minutes from where i live.
might have to check it out sometimedoes it make your tinnitus go nuts if you have it?
Just put on some white noise or pretend your tinnitus is white noise :P
I tried it and just kind of fell asleep.
Maybe I did it wrong

What are the benefits of doing this anyways.
I'm not sure what this photograph is trying to convey

Your body is supposed to fall asleep but your mind continues to be awake.
It's hard to get but once you do it you can do it over and over agian.
Try practicing at night in bed.
Broke me out of a multi-year depression that was getting worse and worse from looking after a suicidal ex.Life changing, for me.
Honestly.
Have been half a dozen times now and always good, but that first time was a turning point.
You'll ruin your hair if you do that.
