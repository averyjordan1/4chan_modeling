BTC is going to slowly be sold off, and BCH purchased.
You have literally only 2 days to get ahead of some these miners.They have a schedule.
You do not.
Your next "10x altcoin" is hiding right in plain sight.
BCH is my store of value.
Going to hold.
This week is going to be historic.
bcash already made the decision to give up claim to ever replacing bitcoin when they broke the difficulty algomight be a good pump and dump now chinks got btfo with b2x, but theres no long term value there
That statement is only partially true.
Feels good to be smart money.
it's only ever going to be the anti-bitcoin fork, there's not much value in that.the absolute best case scenario for bcash is it evolves into a hedge for bitcoin, which would bring it a lot of volatility and volume
evolves into a hedge for bitcoinI have made money with this philosophy already
Safe money is in litecoin for long-term holding.
More accessible to normies since it's on the biggest US exchange.
the best thing would be if you could burn your btc on the main chain and get and send bch instead, to get lower transaction fees
4274028Holy fuck are you tarts going to get BTFOThe flippening is coming, BCH is where you should be parking your money.
The thing is though, that BCH shills are so obnoxious and shitty that I'll never take what you say very seriously.
Even if you are right about some things, and I'm not saying you are, but even if you were it's kind of like yeah, sure, whatever.
yeah marketcap just doubled from 5billion 10 billion in last 2-3 weeks , must be 4chan money
