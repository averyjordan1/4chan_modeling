It's not like the entire globalist scheme isn't to support refugees and destroy the white world.
May as well roll with them for a bit to fill your war chest.
I don't really want to be part of the world where iota wins but it's not like me not holding it is gonna prevent that.
Getting some fat stacks then bailing on the shit show is the best way to survive the mudslime invasion rather than being some poorfag cuck who thinks by them holding a based aryan coin they're gonna prevent armageddon.
being a literal polfagthe team supports building refugee camps (camps in the middle east and Africa, where actual refugees are stuck waiting for their application to be accepted while the immigrants jump on a boat and hide under trucks) into actually livable communities instead of dirty ass tent cities
