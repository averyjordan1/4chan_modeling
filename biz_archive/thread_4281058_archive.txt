Why SAFEX?
If safex is successful with launching the marketplace it will naturally attract many sellers that are already utilizing other markets right now.
This has lots of upside (hint, look at how low the market cap is).
What or who do you think will solve the problem that link is working on right now?
payments and currency corridors >XRPsmart contracts / assests / dapps platform>ETH>NEMstore of wealth asset>BTC
Cloud computing, biometrics, fully autonomous cars, and monero
ETHNEOPAY
Nobody needs to solve the problem.
LINK is trying to get the smart contracts mainstream adopted, but you saw the recent problems like parity, Smart contracts don't even work in the small crypto world, so why would you need to get important data of the outside world.
Or let's say, who is gonna use this risky shit.I see the broad vision of the project, but wont be need for several years.
GNT will be used to make the future.
so why would you need to get important data of the outside worldNot trying to argue but I think you are looking at this from a very short sighted view.
Also, it should be known, I am not some fucking Link fanboy so don't even start with me on that ...
BCH and BTG
We will see where this is going.
And another hard question is, how are you able to value nodes?
It's a fcking pain in the ass to value this right, but i guess it doesn't matter in crypto anyway.
The markets will figure out the value.
It is trying to be the backbone so this is very attractive from an investment prospective because the gates always get the money...
