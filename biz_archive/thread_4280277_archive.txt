Chang remains number 1 on the ACF vote (goldenpepe is his name there), but I've been knocked out of the Top 5 and into number 6 after a whale voted for the other five.If you hold ARK and want to see me and Chang hold two seats on the board and help with ARK community development, we really need your help in voting.
This is just as important as the staking vote, maybe even more so.
It helps us have a bigger say in ARK which will influence the state of the coin in the future.
We've been constant innovators in ARK delegation and we will continue to do so - your vote will allow us to keep being active and at the forefront of ARK as a whole.You can vote for both of us with no penalty.

Already voted for both of you.
Voted
Voted for both
Voted for Chang since he knows what he's doing and can control himself Moon keeps rubbing normalfags the wrong way, it doesn't help that there are screenshots of him being edgy and that he can never dial it down or pick up on social queues.
I'm fine with him running the delegate but I don't want the complications that would come with him being in a position as public as this.
Any additions he can make he'll make through Chang, and I won't have to worry about the community blowing up because of moon getting angry and calling someone a kike.
What did he mean by this?
(There's not detriment to voting both of us in, only positives.)
You're also mistaking me playing bad cop and strategically playing for the 4chan crowd as "autism".
Chang's place is as the normie herder, it's meant to be this way.
I've never went off and called someone a kike outside of this imageboard or our discord.
I'm not an autist who can't control himself publicly.
