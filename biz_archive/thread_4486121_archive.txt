Poorly written headline but still quite clear.
The full bottle costs $3200.
They don't put a full bottle in the shake.
I dont care if I have $100 million in the bank, I would never pay over $8 for a milkshake.
A fool and his money...
You daft m8 ?Why would i throw 0.05BTC at trash ?
I'd pay $10but it would have to be a pretty special occasion
That means they reuse the Remy.
What am I some poor fag that needs to use left over cognac?
I fucking hate these disgusting "most expensive dish" things.
It's always just the same fucking dish but with gold added.I can make the most expensive mashed potatoes by jamming a gold bar in it.
