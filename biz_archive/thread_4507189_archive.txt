Sell link now, rebuy in January with an overpriced btc (10k dollars) and get more link.The only thing that was keeping me from selling was the "maybe they announce something tomorrow and I'll miss out" but now that's gone, kaput, the team already confirmed no news for at least two months being extremely optimistic.With a btc breaking aths everyday doesn't make any sense to hold.Anyone who says just hold is stuck in 2016, you can't afford holding shitcoins anymore.Big link fan here btw just wanted to redpillme you.
Sergey is alternating between eating Big Macs and snorting cocaine off of black BBW booty cheeks while Rory is furiously stroking his pencil dick in the corner.
That’s why all his “updates” trying to hide the fact that this project is a complete debacle are riddled with typos.
Steve is the only one trying.
He’s locked away in his moms basement trying to learn GO.
It’s such an obscure and asinine language that he can’t find the documentation he needs.
He’s about to snap.
He keep frantically calling Sergey.
Sergey only texts back, “new phone, who dis” and “32 million solves my oracle problem.” Get out
So, sell LINK low and buy BTC at ATH?
Got it, thanks!
"LINK will never be 40 cents again"I guess they were right.
But btc has higher chances of getting you 10%-20% gains til January.
Or even better put that amount of btc into good trades, multiply it and rebuy in January how about that.
But btc has higher chances of getting you 10%-20% gains til JanuaryBut BTC also has a higher chance of losing 50% in dollar terms before then>Or even better put that amount of btc into good tradesIt's easier said than done though.It might work out but I'd rather just be patient.
Selling LINK at ATL to buy BTC at ATH just doesn't sit well with me.
It might work, but it sounds like a recipe for getting JUSTed.
I'm sticking with my guns on this onePic related
BTC also has a very good chance of correcting hard in the near future.
I despise Rory the soyboy
