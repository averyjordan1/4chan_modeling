NO
4440097triggered litecucks who are salty about their shitcoin collecting dust while everything else moons, lmao
Slow and steady wins the race, anon
There's something fishy about the recent LTC rallyEverytime it looks to be gaining momentum and tests a daily high it suddenly dumps right back down?The general trend is upwards but feels like it's being supressed?
Thinking in Satoshis is fucking retarded>bitcoin goes x3 in value>if other coins aren't moving along with it, that somehow makes them shitDo you also think about your stocks in their value in Apple shares?
I canâ€™t wait til this goes back down to 4 dollars where it fucking belongs.
Just pulled out because this shit is about to dip hard.
Does litecoin offer any advantages over ethereum?
I don't know shit about crypto other than to invest in underdogsanon...
.97 now, ive been watching it all evening.
WHAT A MEME!
It's actually decentralized?
LTC is getting smart contracts too most likely, and anonymous transactions.
lol anonymous transactionscan watch balance and know how much was spentanon optional = knows i sent anonymous transactionmonero plz
Does the Canadian dolor offer any advantages over Pepsi?ones a currency and ones a platform for smart contrasts
What makes litecoin a better currency than ethereum?
Monero is gonna go out of fashion soon with the update to z transactions on zcash (they have gotten required memory usage down to ~1mb).
Anon I already answered this...See Litecoin transactions are much faster than Ethereum transactions too, which is handy if you're using it as a micro transaction currency.
is literally more likely than 4
should i sell coins at 75 and 80 if this shit breaks out and try to buy back at 65 or what.
Idk when to sell really but im tired of holding when it just keeps hitting 75 then dropping to 65 lol.
just broke 70 on bithumb.

[spoiler]protip and an fyi tbqh on where the majority of institutional money is going ;)[/spoiler]
LTC fudsters are the most autistic people here and that says something
0.0091 BTC is an important level, if we hold this it's motherfucking BULL TIME.LTC in shortterm, ETH midterm.
I hold tons of bothLike a BOSS
how it is supposed to workYeah these short term parabolic moves followed by sudden dumps are completely normal

okay buddy.
stick to looking at coinbase charts then for your trading then.
it's not like the entire market moves wherever the hell btc tells it to.
Gonna laugh at all you faggots who are going to FOMO buy into LTC at $80 while they could have gotten in low now.
It doesn't you goddamn retard
ether decoupled from btc and is stuck to the low 300s>If you got off the ether train on ~june 26 because that's when it declined relative to btc you would have had substantially more fiat>we can estimate the decoupling occurred around August 1st, coincidently, yet again you still would have been better off trading for btc.
Instead of of 20% increase you would have had 2.5-3x increase insteadyeah, trading for fiat is such a good idea kek.
Only because btc tripled.
Your assumption that it will keep doing so is baseless.
You still can't buy a coffee or a house with bitcoin, so you look at the value in fiat
desu I'm actually kinda sceptical that a decoupling occurred, ether's only higher because btc is higher.I'll probably run a co-integration to actually see later.
kek.
school is actually useful for once.

 niggeeh.
Are you slow?
That article is not about buying a house with bitcoin.
It's about using your bitcoin as collateral for a fiat loan, which you use to buy a house.You wanna know why?
Because bitcoin is a store of value.
Not a currency.

Literally >exchange bitcoin to fiat>use fiat to buy houseYeah you van totally buy a house with bitcoin.
Hey if I sell my yacht for fiat I can also use that to buy a house.
Does that mean that yachts are a currency now?
