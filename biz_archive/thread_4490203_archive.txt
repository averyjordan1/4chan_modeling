I'm looking to start my own business but I'm a complete brainlet when it comes to anything involving finances.
Where can I learn about all this shit?
Is there a good book or two or should I enroll in an economics course?
Are you a woman?
No.
I'm just really unskilled with money and trying to improve myself.
check your local/regional university homepage and search for economic courses and their reading list, read those.
And if you have the time, sneak into lectures, just don't shower for 3 days and disguise as bum, and if somebody ask what you are doing there, ask them if they are racist bigots for shaming a pan sexual transgenderracial person.
