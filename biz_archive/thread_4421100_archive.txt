What is even the point of flipping random coins?
Unless you are willing to put 10k at stage at the beginning, there is no reason for you to trade alt coins to outmoon BTC.
The real money is in ICO's.
I have managed to buy powerledger and made 1.5x on it, without withdrawing at an optimal time within like 2 months.
This same process took 4 months when I was doing it with ARK ( a coin that just proved to be good, I guess).
What is the point of picking alt coins over ICO's?
Yes, its more work, but its definitely worth it.
