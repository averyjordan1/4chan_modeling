My mind has just been shattered.
I talked to one of my old HS friends today.
The man has been making six figures since senior year of HS.
He put a hundred thousand in the bank the summer between senior year and freshman year of college.
He said he has just been trading stocks, specifically reversals, although I have no idea what the fuck that means.
He was disappointed at having a net worth of "low six figures".
This kid is 18 years old.
He plans on putting at least another hundred grand in the bank this summer and says he wants to start making "real money" soon, as if that is nothing.
I talked to him and he is gonna show me a bit about what he does.
I assume he taught himself, and I would not be surprised if he browsed /biz/ considering his personality, but holy fuck, how?
I know nothing of the market.
I have $8900 and a car to my name right now.
How do I break into this?
How do I do whatever the fuck this man is doing?
Please, give me books, give me resources, give me tips, give me anything, but damn it I need money.
Chances are he's lying.
He isn't though, he showed me the numbers, just in his savings, not even his portfolio.
