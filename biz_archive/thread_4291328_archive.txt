BCH goes up BTC goes down BCH goes down BTC goes up.
Not hard to profit from this retards.
Hot tip, BCH is on its way up again soon.
Wait an hour buy.
the question is; how long it will last?
At least until the 13th for the first time in any markets history we have been given set dates to work with.
This fork nonsense is the greatest thing ever if you're not emotionally attached to coins.

Coordinated PnD group here if you guys want some easy gains, I've made a decent amount from it so far.
You can reliably make 30% a pump.
Just remember to sell at the peaks and hold for too long.https://discord.gg/u7kgySu
4291440Don't worry anons the BCH train still has a lot of gas left but it will dump again just make sure you get out before it does and be ready to buy back in.
Don't be greedy if you have a nice profit take it and wait do not FOMO back in.
If you bail out and and take a profit and it continues to moon remember you are still a winner not a loser.
You made a profit!
Something not a lot of people can do in this game.
Then just sit patiently and time a reentry on a nice dip combined with a dry up of volume.
