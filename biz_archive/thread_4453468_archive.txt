BCH about to moonDon't say you weren't informed
I..I was n-not informed
monitoring threadthank you based 80mm
You said the same shit with the same PIC yesterday.
It won't moon until BTC crashes down to under 2k when BCH can overtake it.
The Tethers are prob being released to keep the BTC going while the infrastructure in places like coi9nbase is installed first.
Iâ€™m in if it drops to 1000
