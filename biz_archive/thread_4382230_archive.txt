The rumours are true - BitBean's rebrand to BeanCash has been confirmed.
It will probably happen in the next two days.
They're going to launch their new wallet on the testnet as well on November 16th..Expected value: 150 sats.Did you get yours on Bittrex already?
Don't complain when you need to buy at an all time high.. x2 if you invest now lol.
Technical Analysis
thats some shitty TA
so what happens if it does the complete opposite?
sidling up to BCHshows the team is smart enough to see who the winning side is going to be, if anything else
Then it was simply a fakeout
Nothing is certain in crypto world, you're right.
However, if you look at the history of the coin, it has already pumped to 250+ levels.
Even if it will be a P&D, selling at 100 will still give me more than x2 profits.It's just a matter of getting in, in time and defining an exit strategy.I bought at 35 - my first selling target (1/3 of my holdings) is 85.
Second 135 (1/3) and third 300 (3/3), just in case.
Surely the biggest problem with BitBean is that it has 'bean' in the name at all?
no thats the cutest part
Hahahahaha, hahahahahahahaha, sorry, this is so stupid, I can't believe it.Also this.
Yeah they have a chance at rebranding and they stick with this stupid fucking thing.
this is so stupidI mean the name change.
I've no opinion about OP's price prediction.
I hate the 'Bean' part as well.
But the other areas do look interesting, especially the roadmap.
I participate the bi-weekly call with the core dev, and they are hungry.Other than that, I know a Discord Group is planning to pump the coin.
I just don't know when.
Which is why I advise any of you buyers to set conditional sell targets just in case.
If they decide to pump, it could go past 150 sats.
Selling at (or just before) 100 sats is not a bad idea.
Prediction
