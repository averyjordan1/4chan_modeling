And it ain't even Monday yet.

IS BCH GOIGN DOWN?
No.
Only the beginning of it's dominance.By 2018 it will be on Coinbase and heavily shilled on normmie (((finance))) magazines and newspapers.
i genuinely believe this, this entire coupe is the most Jewish big money scam i've ever seen.
So obvious its going to win.
What does the chart mean?
4329541That chart means a double top is forming.
And when it finishes, expect a bigger crash than the last.
Yup, a full MONTH of BTC price inflation and steadiness, and then overnight confidence pulls out and BCH gets a massive flood of money and confidence.The timing here is important.Look at when BCH took off, just before the weekend.
Exactly when all the desks at the big investment companies are empty and the portfolios are helpless.This was organised to pull in big money into BTC, and then dump them with bags.And guys, don't forget about the next fork on November 16th...
I should mention this too, good post Anon.BCH isn't here to stay.It'll go right back down to 200-300$ a coin.You're best bet for surviving this money shuffle is to get back in BTC for the fork, then sell the new coin at its 24H high over the next day.
(It's up to you to gamble on what the high will be!)
