is it too late to buy some bitbay?
Fuccccck I wanna know tooBought some right nowSomeone respond plssssss
Yes you retardIt's going to dump soonUnless you feel like doing things the /biz/ way by buying high and selling low
 #Some anon said it would hit 1500.I didn't pay attention because when I checked the price was the same 3 hours after that was posted but now is climbing.What do.
Shoulda done your research like the rest of us smartbros and hodled through the harsh bitcoin wars.Bought at 420 sats and I'm going to hodl for a looooooong time
What's the target like.. short termish (next 24 has)?
1000?
1500?
There's a wall at 800 and 1000, I think we break that if trends continue at this rate
