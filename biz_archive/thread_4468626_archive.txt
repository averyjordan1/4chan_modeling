The most important thing to remember is 1) their github is really moving and they’re doing a lot of dev work and 2) its still a platform even if its just an app at the moment.
I don’t think they get enough credit for doing a new chain as opposed to just the easy road of erc20.
If it was a scam or anything like it they would of made a token and made life easier for themselves as opposed to building out their ico distribution.
I don’t know what will happen but i’m confident in at least 2x-3x from here.
Over next 2-3 months.
