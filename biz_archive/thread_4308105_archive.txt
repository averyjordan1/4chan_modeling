start a long>coin freefalls into the depths of hell>start short>coin rises with an unstoppable ferocityI think this world was fabricated to make me miserable.
To be surrounded by businesses and successful people.
To dangle the fruit of happiness just inches away from me only to throw my dreams back into the pit where they can fester and rot.I'm not enjoying this ride we call life.
Not sure I ever did or ever will.
buy coin, immediately drops in price>sell coin, immediately goes interstellarWe really are in the matrix aren't we?
4309479i am also trapped in this personal hell along with you two anons.
it is a hell of our own doing, we only have ourselves to blame, but at times it does seem orchestrated by exterior powers...
I use to be like you but then I got gud.
It is clearly outside forces causing this.
I sometimes wonder if Roko is punishing me because I made fun of GNT a time or two too many.
