35 years old.I cashed out my 401K and paid taxes and penalties on the money.
Got about $100K all said and done (what ever... employer was matching all my contributions so I broke even on 12 year investment).Put $50K into stocks and ETFs early this year and made about $10K so farOther $50k in crypto ... started in July... at $100K right now.Net gains in 2017 after starting trading stocks and crypto: $60K...Net stress levels as factor of original stress levels: 2.5-3x This is not the life I was hoping for.
Not worth the $60 K (which I view as the best case scenario for gains in this market)...Stocks and cryptos are heavily inflated and we’re due for bearish period ... pulling out and putting into boomer style mutual fund (a 5 year plan fund that keeps shit safe and less exposed)...But currently:$65K etfs and mutual funds and some stocks$80K Crypto (and declining as I slowly lock back into fiat)$30K fiat.Also got a house I bought at $560K currently appraised at $800k... need to re-finance because my healthcare monthly premiums are putting me at break-even for my salary...kids starting preschool as well so added expenses.Surviving... have to make shit work.Crypto did give me a good cushion though.
I’ll wait and see until Jan 2018
You will get a better id next time.
$1300 or 100%
Out of subject.What mobile apps should I use to lurk the crypto market, and which one to buy & sell ?I lurked sometimes this board (I was there when ETH was 1$) and I did nothing.
But now I want to prepare a start.
"To prepare" because after 2 last month, my actual job will be a permanent contract and I want to wait that before starting to invest
no apps for exchanges yet reallyi have android i use>conimarketcap>zeroblock>blockfolio>monero status>bitcoin ticker widget>digital currency widget>bitcoin wallet>cointelegraph
