Everyone seems pissed they lost money when they bought at $1,500-$2,000.Supposedly we are supposed to always do the opposite of /biz., right?I stayed away from this.
Should I buy now?
:)
no fucking moron, it will go back to 400$ in the next 72 hoursits over, it's a scam PnD
yes, the bottom is in
Unironically.
Yes.Ironically.
FUCK NO TRASH DEADCOIN
If you're a retarded Faggot
bitcoin core is a scam, this is satoshi's vision!
but....who do i trust?
i am just looking for a short term flip.
It's way too soon to buy in.Wait for that shit to plummet back to it's previous support levels before the segwit2x fomo got out of hand.
This is your last chance to buy BCH.
We kill BTC in 12 hours
satoshi's vision!
every shitcoin is about to bounce and you pick the ONE that was pumping when everything else was dyingbravo anonyou've outsmarted us all
no one gives a shit about the tech we want money
No wait till it pumps and then buy at the top like the rest of /biz/
This is outdated, the Bitcoin Classic team shutdown because they're confident BCH is the future.
So there are 5 active dev teams for BCH.All the rest is accurate though (although $3/transaction is lowballing).
it's down like 150% though....surely this drama is not over?
got a bunch of shitcoins in the negative that will sit and wait.
Look at the chart, the support is at 850 dollar, don't buy before it touches it.
true.
hmmm.
what to do.
but it's been hovering at 1150 for hours.
new support, or bot bullshit?
BCH is about to moon again, weak hands BTFO
$1,300.
Thanks fer nuthin, biz.
;P
