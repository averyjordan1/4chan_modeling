Functions of money:>a medium of exchange>a unit of account>a store of valueProperties of money:>Fungibility: its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution (i.e., interchangeability).>Durability: able to withstand repeated use.>Portability: easily carried and transported.>Cognizability: its value must be easily identified.>Stability of value: its value should not fluctuate.And something my professor said but it doesn't say this on wikipedia:>scarce: it's limited or otherwise everyone could have infinite moneyCan bitcoins ever be considered to be valid money?I would argue that bitcoins are not stable at all.
The value flunctuates like crazy.
Someone who was a poor person in 2009 if he had 20 bitcoins, would be rich now, without doing anything.I would also argue against the portability.
You can only use bitcoins as long as you have access to the internet, which makes it harder to use in rural areas.
You city folk never considered that, did you?
Paper cash works everywhere I go.And i would definitely argue against its limitedness.
You can pretty much mine infinite bitcoins.
It may become increasingly difficult, but that's not a problem, because computers are becoming more powerful as well.
Bitcoins can't be a valid currency, if people can figuratively print it themselves.Is it really just a pyramid scheme that wannbe "fuck da government :DD" anarchists fall for?
?More importantly, if bitcoins become the world currency, wouldn't that put an end to democracy and put corporations into power?
Nothing stops corporations from using bitcoins after all.
But there will be no more government to keep the corporations under control.
Remember: Nesquick practically poisoned babies in Africa.
Corporations will literally kill you if it makes them profit and if they're allowed to do it.
