Here's whats going on.
The BCH runup was just marketing.
It was just to grab everyone's attention and show they how vulnerable btc is.Now we are looking at a dif adjustment in about three hours.
BCH will dump a little bit to make BTC more profitable to mine.
The memepool will start to clear up.
All those panic coins will finally hit the exchanges.
That's when the real whaleflip starts.
when does the difficulty adjust?
you have a time for that?
I thought it took weeks?
That's when the real whaleflip starts.so.. bch will moon again or..?
coins been transit for over a dayYeah you're probably right.
https://fork.lol/pow/retarget2 hours, 12 minutes until BCH difficulty goes up by 400%Although I keep seeing mentioned a BCH update/fork coming in the next day or two that is going to mess with the difficulty adjustment.
If anyone knows more then, some more info would be great.
ThisThe moon is about to resume, BCH going to 0.5, get in boyos!
How does the difficulty increasing 400% imply a moon mission?
I think he's hoping that miners will continue mining BCH at a loss until the fork, which will bring the diff back down.
lol, I dont think you understand how this works.. it will crash.
43233174324101Price is also a factor.
If the coins you are mining become worth more then it becomes more profitable to mine.
BCH was at 0.1 before this bull run, and it got to about 0.4 before correcting to about 0.2.
If it gets back to 0.4 the that is a 400% increase.
This would completely mitigate a 400% increase in difficulty.
The miners are mining BCH because it's easy and high valuation.
Now the difficulty is going 4x so it will make more sense to move out of BCH back to BTC.
The biggest weakness of BTC will be resolved at this point so calling a BCH moon with increased difficulty.. lmao
Oh man poor bagholders.
you mean poor BTC bagholders.
