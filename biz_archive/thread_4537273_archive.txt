Nobody knows.
If you're holding long term, it really doesn't matter too much.
I'd say buy in with ETH for now and maybe see if you can catch a BTC dip.
But BTC is a monster and it may keep going up.
Maybe set buy orders at $5k $6k and $7k per Bitcoin or something like that.
Putting a good chunk into ETH right now is important though.
It'll probably go to about $800 by the time this pump is done.
But I'm just speculating.
NEO, ARK (both preparing for moon)Substratum/POWR (small coins will rise higher, just try to buy lower than ATH for max profit)1% DGB, just to give those marines some hope and to finance sharpies in poopers-1% Link because the community is insufferable
Presumably he wants his portfolio to increase rather than decrease in value though
