Who was in the ICO?
Only $12M, of which 10M was closed presale.
This has so much potential to go 100x
http://science.tokenhub.com/ if you wonder
Put in 1 ETH for the sake of it, hope it goes 100x
Whenever 1 of their holdings will have an ICO, you'll get a portion.
I don't see why there was so little interest?
Me either, team and whitepaper looked top qualityLack of hype is my guess
Spend about $400 on itcomfy as fuck
