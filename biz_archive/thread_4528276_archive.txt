That's pretty substantial.
I wonder how the market will react.
It's fucking nothing
The fuck is proof of caring?
The blockchain is powered by love.
It's not YUGE but it's definitely good.
Show's there is a lot of backing.Also, Vitalik is an advisor for Kenetic.If anytime, we see a solid ETH + QSP Endorsement, then it's game over.
This baby is going lunar.
Seeing multiple well known VCs with legit projects investing millions in a token is nothing?
Its proof that the project has their vote of cobfidence.
I might increase my stack in a dip.
"Love you all"
