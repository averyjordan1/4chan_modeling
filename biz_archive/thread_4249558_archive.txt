yeah me too
I sold at 6500, decided to not buy back in till post fork.
God fucking damnit
Now people are saying Segwit2x is cancelled/suspensed?!?!!?
Shouldnâ€™t this be dumping?I AM FUCKING SHAKING RIGHT NOW
Tfw I was actually planning on selling all of my BTC for alts later today.
That was fucking close.
SOLD AT 7200 2 DAYS AGO AND CHANGED ALL FOR ALTS, NOW EVERYTHING IS GOING DOWN, FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Dont wait too long!
Altcoins will pump hard soon.
it is dumping
ummm, no it isn't?
Thank god, had to have a fucking cigarette because I thought it was about to shoot to 10k
Segwit2x is officially cancelled.
Everyone is pumping now.
Most aren't buying into bitcoin because of b2x, oh hell, I didn't even know about b2x when I bought them.All b2x represented was instability.
why would it pump if BTC if no more free money?
it's also no more doubt about its future.There was a chance above 0% that bitcoin would just die after the fork.
If you have millions to invest, you don't risk it all if there is a 0.1% chance of losing it
quick guys its back to 7500!
go buy back in!
Because Bitcoin is the only crypto that really matters.
It really is.The other altcoins are just gambles that may pay off in more BTC

>Read about Bitcoin in 2006>Bought 100 bitcoins back in 2012 to complement the few 20 something bitcoins I mined from ~2008>Sold it because nothing ever happened to it.>Bought again at $2k>It tanked the same day, and kept crashing down, had to sell at $1.4k>It's now at 7.2kIt's like a fucking magnet always facing the wrong side I'm looking.
cash out half of it right now, half of the rest at 15k, half of the rest at 30k, etc
Dunno what to do, hold or sell?
I just cashed out BTC and BCH, i'm waiting a day or two to see what happens
bitcoin didnt exist until 2009 you fucking clown
It will dip more when china wakes up to be honest.
That's my best guess
It has been launched on 2009People speak about "b money" since 1998
Started mining in 2001, good times...
doesn't know about the pre-buying era.
tfw you used to be able to mine on a gameboy color
tfw solo mined Bitcoin back in the 80s on my Commodore 64 home computer.That's the reason why Bitcoin is so slow nowadays.Outdated 80s tech.
So pathetic to catch out losers making up stories.
You are even lower anf more patgetic than most anons
because no more DOUBTS about BITCOIN FUTURE for now.. BTC GOING TO THE MOON 10K GET COMFY FAGGOTS , BTC TO 100K
