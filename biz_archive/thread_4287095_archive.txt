 You must fight the fomo.
Don't make an emotional trade.
are you telling me to keep my btc too?
but it KEEPS GOING DOWN.
why shouldnt i sell it all for bitcoin cash
A month ago I was laughed at endlessly for dumping money into BCH.>BAGHOLDER>CHINK COIN>STFU JIHANDamn it's sweet that I stuck to the fundamentals of what makes a cryptocurrency work and disregarded the Core shills.
I've never been richer.Thank you shills.
buy equal to what you have in btc.
1 goes up the other goes down, until you find the weiner.
3rd highest market cap coin goes up 50% in a day>Am I too late?Lmao
Damn it's sweet that I stuck to the fundamentals of what makes a cryptocurrency worktell me your secrets
I'd like to know more about that too
can you explain market cap to me?
it's total coins times the current market price per unit, right?
so why is that a good thing to compare?
I traded all my BTC for BCH earlier today, I don't regret it.It is true, BTC is going low and BCH is going high but who knows when this will stop?
It doesn't make much sense either way and I'm up already -15%.
Just gotta way for it flipping again and then I'll buy back into BTC at a nicely low price.
Should have done it, should still do it.
Just watch the market closely after you do.
The flippining will either occur or it won't --better be on the right boat when it's clear which.
