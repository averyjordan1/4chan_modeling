Ok so like wtf.
I was gonna send 8 bucks worth of bitcoins to a place and the additional network fee was 12 dollars...Like it used to be 3. which I guess Im fine with.
Why is this?
and will it lower down anytime soon?
the network is too congested because bchit will go back to normal when difficulty readjusts next week
digital gold
memepool is draining, chill or go with BCH instead
the network is being attacked by blockstreamonly quads can stop them
the future is worse than the present$0 to move gold10% to move shitcoin
>Like it used to be 3. which I guess Im fine with.
Your OK with a MF $3 fee on $8?!
well that was easy.
