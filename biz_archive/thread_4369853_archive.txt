I work for a company that helps increase social activity and provides twitter followers, reddit upvotes, etc.
Few ICOs bought some followers and other services.
I got purchase proof as well, should I leak boyz?
go for it
do you also sell /biz/ shillposts?
how much did core pay?
let my digits answer your question
do it this way help to weed out the scams
One is called Aventus and bought around 30K followers so far and another order of 60K followers by end of this week.
Watch their followers on twitter to confirm.
You will also see 3rd party ads and increase shills on reddit, facebook, and a lot of bots.
We have also sold them youtube comments and botted their views.
I will post another one tomorrow.
This is an image of one of their orders; so far we got paid around $1200-$1400 for all those services.
