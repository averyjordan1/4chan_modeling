Price porn usually gets me horny, but I'm going with 12 if the platform is launched, 7 if not.
If the platform becomes usable it will go up to $25.
When it launches and normies see 1 SALT on the platform is worth $25, it'll pump pretty hard into the high teens, low 20's.
This is when we sell and dump on them, and if you like the project re-buy after the dump.
Will the SALT platform be some sort of nu-silkroad?
If so this shit will easily get to $25 lmao.
I think they will raise the price on the platform once it gets close to $25.
I would not be surprised if it gets to three digits next year.
Lots of mofos will be using this platform.
