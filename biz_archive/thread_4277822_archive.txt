The path to wealth is not easy, friendo.I'd rather deal with EtherDelta than wagecuck for the rest of my life.
bite that bullet my friend.I just rode NIO 3x and Confido 6x in the past 2 days.
EPY is easily the next 5-10x10 cents, 15 million supply, its a fucking joke.

Nice gains, friendo.
Congrats.I rode Confide and NULS but only got 1x each.
