Somebody once told me that biz is gonna troll meI ain't the sharpest tool on the boardI was looking kind of dumb with my finger and my thumbIn the shape of an "L" on my foreheadWell the dumps start coming and they don't stop comingFed to the whales and I hit the ground runningDidn't make sense not to buy chainlinkYour brain gets smart but your head cant thinkSo much to buy, it'll never sinkSo what's wrong with buying the chainlink?You'll never know if you don't holdYou'll never shine if it don't growHey now, you're a shitcoin, get your game on, shill awayHey now, you're a deadcoin, don't pump up, don't get paidNone of your chainlink is soldOnly mooning coins are gold
