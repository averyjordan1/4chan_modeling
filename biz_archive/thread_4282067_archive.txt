Just started trading on Bitmex, messing around with the calculator for larping.If I short 1 BTC @ 100x @ 7000$, then exit @ 3500, it's show that I only profit 1BTC, WTF?The no matter what the leverage number is, the profit is still the same?
Shit's broken or I just have to all in on altcoins?
How much do you have and how much are you loaning?
BTC @ 100X, don't know more than that
This shit is supposed to 50X my 1BTC, wtf happened?
