Everyone has been shitting on the Segwit2X team for over a month now and they just cancelled the fork.Doesn't that make the Segwit2x team the good guys?

Nobody was forcing anyone to mine anythingThey could just mine it a day and call it quits if unsuccesful.
Wouldn't have been a big loss
Nope they didn't have enough mining support to continue.
