Who is still trading on poloniex?
I withdrew all my funds and switched to Bitfinex.
I really don't trust them desu.
I've had too many problems with withdrawals and whatnot.
I use every exchange (including trade satoshi, cryptopia and all that) except this one.
Am I missing something?
Is it any good?
I never had any problem with poloniex.
I am, make around 40% a day in Satoshi at least
Same hereI do some casual lending thru them
I think this fud was created on social networks so that bittrex whales who had accumulated a lot on bittrex would pump their bags with people from polo.
My support ticket has been pending for 5 months At least I only lost about 1 eth
