Can someone explain why markets and exchanges are so crazy about ID and authentication?Is there some legal reason or is it because they can get scammed in some way?I've never understood why i need to be on a damn webcam holding up the back my passport to buy some bitcoins
there is a legal reason.
it is called kyc and is part of the patriot act/anti money laundering stuff
Because exchanges are subject to laws like every other business
for the tax man
So basically: if the feds come the exchange has to reveal that person's identity?What about exchanges hosted in shitty countries and tax havens?
so they can identity thief u when they want tolyc/aml>cryptoebin jej
I use binance and have no verification at all
nigga you high
Yeah and that's probably one of the reason's binance seem shady.
I've got 20.000e on it so I hope it's fine
