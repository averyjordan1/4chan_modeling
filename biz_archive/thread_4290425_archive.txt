We need a crypto board.
It's popular enough that it's completely taken over biz, so it makes sense.
No, we just need to rename this one.

Perfect.Frankly I'm tired of crypto.
It's the stupidiest possible way to make money and it doesn't favor slow intellectuals with great philosophies.It favors cunning quick gambling geniuses who can recognize numbers and popularity polls.
/biz/ = Bangladeshi ICO Zoo
crypto is cutting edge, innovative, and highly important,autistic sperging about how to arbitrate garbage-tier knockoff shitcoins is what tires me.the whole space is a scam hype machine.
Holy shit
You're on it retard.
/biz/ was created as a containment board because /g/ started up filling with crypto threads.
This, its worrying how new people are here.
Was more humorous back in the day with the gents raging every day but about the cancer continually filling their board but kek.
/youcan'tcashout/ this will be the bomb brah
Hes trolling probably but I have seen the same thing said a lot before.
I am not surprised that most everyone on /biz/ is new .
Just take a look at the speed of the board just from the beginning of the year to now.
Grown a lot.
/tulip/
People(not me) already complain about pol showing up, that's just begging for it.
