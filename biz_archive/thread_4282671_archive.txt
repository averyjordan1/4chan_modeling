I lost my job yesterday.
They laid me off due to lack of work.
It's a real bummer, I only have 62 bitcoin and wanted to acquire more before the price became too expensive to buy anymore.
Someone tell me everything will be okay.
At some point in time, a general market crash is going to happen.
Maybe now, maybe in a year from 35k down to 10k.Don't put all your money in crypto, don't put all your cryptomoney in one coin.You will be fine, as long as you have your health.
Exercise!
Nice Brag post

I was being paid 108,000 a year working as a plumber in Toronto but construction seems to be dying down now.
Total fucking bullshit.
How can I afford bitcoin now when it will be 20,000 before Christmas with Chicago cme futures launching....
Ok stop fucking around.
