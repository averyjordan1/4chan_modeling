Why is this board so fucking insane?
Just one week ago when BTC rallied from under 6k to 7.5k there were literally dozens of threads like "CANT STOP THE KING DIE ALTS DIE" and now, just a week later, with Bitcoin in a small dip (not even back under 6k) and people are prophesizing BTC's doom?
What's going on?
This fucking Segwit business is really leaving me rustled

Every single thought and emotion expressed on these boards is amplified 100x for dramatic / comedic effect.
