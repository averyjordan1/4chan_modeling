is it worth trying to learn it for trading?
I am terrible trader but already know python
Just find some blue chip coins like Digibyte, buy and don't touch it for 30 years.
Yes, it is useful.
But you have to be creative with your variables.
Past price is not useful at all.Things like Google Trends data, Twitter sentiment analysis, Reddit subscriber count, etc etc are unique variables that should help you.
