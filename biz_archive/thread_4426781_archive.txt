i sure hope you fuckers accumulated during the dip yesterday.
QTUM is going parabolic soon.
This is like getting a second chance at buying NEO or maybe even ETH for $10expecting to reach ATH sometime tomorrow.
tfw 250 qtumfeels real good broh
What's the news?I believe QTUM will eventually cuck NEO big-time, but, like, why right now?What's the news?
maybe not tomorrow, but expect some serious price movement on the 20th, there has been heavy accumulation going on in the 160-180k zone
why would it?
who cares about a bitcoin clone with ethereum's vm slapped on top of it?where's the original tech?
why would they copy such an ancient blockchain, and the first smart contract platform's code?
couldn't they think of any improvements to make in that time?
The base layer/chain is not really a bitcoin clone, it even uses proof of stake.
Just confusing marketing imo.
$65M ICO INK will become tradable in 2 days and its only being traded against QTUM pairing in a major high volume Chinese exchange which is not visible in CMC yet>Medibloc ICO in a few days, another anticipated ICO which will raise a lot of money thus increasing buy pressure on QTUM>Qbao concluded the pre-sale recently, ICO is coming up soonThere is too much going on and whales are definitely aware of this, I've seen major whales accumulating 100s of BTCs worth of QTUM the past few days.
this guy gets it
is this thread what y'all dumping looks like?
can't tell if its going to 11 or 35
WOW OP actually knows his shit..
Tired of this NEO centralized bullshit.. QTUM is the ETH of the east.
Ad arguable better than ETH and any other chain.
QTUM is the future.
i saw this with all due respect but it would be completely pointless to try and shill this here, the market cap is over $1B+ so the impact /biz/ could make is inconsequential.
I'm just stating my observation.
If you don't buy this now it's a mistake, at the very least you'll make 20-30% by tomorrow and potentially 50-100%+ within a few days
