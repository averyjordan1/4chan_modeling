kek 2-3k isn't high iq.
y'all coward fucks.
been in since sub 1k and THAT is the high iq patrician level.
Pretty much.
But Wall Street is going to get BTC "regulated" so they can buy in lower.
Well if you bought at 2k you've tripled your initial investment, how is that not smart?
Being smart money is p cool.
Haven't worked for the last year, and have spent it partying and banging twinks.
I'm orange and green sorta.I first knew about bitcoin in the $100-500 range and gambled everything away.
Then I first invested in bitcoin at $2500, bought a lot, but panic sold when it dipped from $5k to $3k.
Fuck.
how does this pyramid scale to when bitcoin reaches 50k?
>tfw been in all colors at one point in timewhy did i spend 800 btc on drugs
At least you can tell your grandkids, and they'll assume you had Scarface style coke and hookers parties on an epic scale, rather than the reality that you smoked a few ounces of weed in 2011
Dumbass
somewhere between smart money and CIA>still poorI'm not so smart, OP
$295 but you don't really have to be smart to invest in Bitcoin back in the those days.
The problem was that cryptocurrency publications were very rare and even the technology which is until now, is still doubted.
Some stock wolves may have invested before smart money had poured in.
