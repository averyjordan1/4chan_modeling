Is there a way to just type in how much of each coin you're holding?
I find the buy and sell function gives me inaccurate balances.
Just type it in once on the buy retard
Ok but then say I trade some ETH for ARK let's say.
I use the sell and deduct from ETH and they balance is off by a bit.
Would anyone be interested in a blockfolio alternative that isn't fucking a pain in the ass to use?>Majority of the altcoin prices don't update>Charts allow only several timeframesI plan on solving these problems.
Also I would like the option to add stocks and metals as well.
Please respond.
Would you use this instead of blockfolio?
Yes.
I want to just type in my current holding of each coin and have it show the total value.
I mean, you can already do that with blockfolio but it's of course less intuitive than it should be.
You add a buy, then if you sell some of it, you can just edit the buy and subtract what you sold.
With mine there will be an option to simply have current holdings, like you said.
There's a pretty massive gap in crypto portfolio trackers atm.
They are all missing some key feature making them shit.> non shit UI with actual valuable information> (((API support))) who the fuck wants to manually log trades unless you're a forever poor hodler> doesn't cost $300/yearRight now cointracking.info is hands down the best but $300/year is a joke for something you could make in a week.
The problem with having API support for all the popular exchanges is that each and every one is set up differently, so it would take me a while to program that in.
But yes I could do that.
I'm just going to start with the simple stuff, I'll make it a blockfolio clone that takes its prices from the coinmarketcap API so that they are actually updated properly.
I'll also add stocks and metals support.
Then I'll release it and just update it periodically with the more complex stuff like charts and auto trade logging.
Thanks for your input.
