If you're buying or not selling alts right now you're a fool.
Sell, they're already dumping.
Sell.
Sell you fucking fools
altcoins going up again when btc dumps more.
I expect btc to dump, you will see it dump more soon
when it stabilises and starts to go down linerly, alts are gonna get slaughtered once again
What?
There is still majority of the world who is asleep.
The news is not priced in by far.
I think we're at the floor of a lot of things already.
Eth at $300, OMG at $6
not happening.
unless you fags announce another fork hahaahahahaha you wanna play the fork trump card again brah?
no, btc down alts up
Actually, there will be Bitcoin Silver, but who cares.
The spike was due to short squeeze and we're already heading to the next squeeze
So you people really think the no 2x correction is only $100?
anyone fucking with alts right now is going to get burned.
x was holding the run back.
Who is going to rush back into alts with bitcorn at this price?
Chinks are sleeping now, just wait
BTC price still has the fantasy 2x price included.
No 2x means price will correct $1300 that the futures sold for
no, btc down alts downbtc up alts downthe only time alts go up is when btc is stable.
Or a flash crash which is temporary.
