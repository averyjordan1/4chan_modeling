This is it.The last push.That leak was 100% accurate.Antpool to shift to BCC in a few hours.
Transaction times on BTC are about to get BTFOIf BCC fails then it's finished forever.
Expect them to go all out
so should i buy bcc now and sell when it 2x?
Minister you Jihan
It's a risky call.
BCC could literally be the new BTC.
This isn't a meme anymore.
This is a legitimate potential.
I am putting it at a 40% chance at this point.
Antpool is going to lose millions of dollars just so you can sell your bags?stay deluded
They weren't mining when BCC was more profitable.
Yes they are willing to take a hit
It's not going to be much of a hit when the flippening happens
True
