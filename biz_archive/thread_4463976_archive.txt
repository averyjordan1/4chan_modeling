SHHHhhhhhh they’re still learning and they won’t learn until they get hot pokered in the anus by shitcoins.
implying I'm in crypto for slow gainsOy vey
>Outplayed by normies holding btc on coinbase
All you HAVE to do is buy and hold BTC
buy my unusable legacy shitcoinlol no thanks i like my cryptos to be functional so I can use them for their intended purposes.
If I had only held bitcoin I would have made 160k in 7 months.Instead I made 1.2 million.The only newfags make money in crypto is through alts.
Wait until BTC hits 16k to double my money?
No thanks.
The only time I hold bitcoin is when I sell alts to buy other alts.
Started from the bottom now we here.
I followed the same logic but jesus the last 2 months were brutal and BTC has just completely destroyed alts.
I'm still hoping for the massive alt rush pullback or all alt's are literally dead, they are so cheap now.I miss the days of may/june where btc and alts could pump alongside each others, the normies on coinbase made money and the smart traders investing in up and coming alts made even more.Now the market is just dumb
I want to believe in alts though :(
$700 to $8150 in a year>slow gainsoy wisss
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS TO HOLD THE DAMN BTC CJ.
