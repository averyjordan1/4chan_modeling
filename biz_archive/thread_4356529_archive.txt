Guys imagine bitcoin valuing 10k near future.Also bitcoin cash valuing 4k.
Bitcoin and bitcoin cash HAVE to coexist because of ASIC exploit that cannot be patched on both.
ASICMINING tool, which bitcoin cash CEO is monopoly of, will continue to raise price of both btc and bch together.
If you guys are bag holder of BCH, hold forever cuz it literally cannot sink as long as BTC is alive.
Also as a tip of btc values over 10k, it takes 50 dollars per transaction.
Which sound cheap but not if you are average joe holding .003
SHHHHHHH
