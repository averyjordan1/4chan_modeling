What base currency does everyone use between trades?
BTC/ETH/USDT?
I find it can be confusing to see where you really stand relative to your initial fiat investment when trading in satoshis?
Do you huys always trade out of alts into BTC?
I use ETH as my "middle man" between alts and fiat.BTC is all over the fucking place and USDT is shady as fuck right now.
ETH is currently the safe choice.

This is what I was initially using just because ETH looked to be the most stable.
But now I am nervous trading back into to them in terms of "waiting" for buy orders to fill for orders of ETC-> something else because it is near resistance points so pull backs can be imminent.
Why tf did bitfinex have to fuck up USDT... it was literally such a fucking good idea that really simplified a baseline for trading and tracking gains/trade moves imo.
if you're paying attention to your initial investment, you're doing it wrong.sell at the top of the green candles, buy at the bottom of the red candles.accumulate a high scoreit's that easy.
