It's easier than you think lads>find businesses in high-end parts of your town>tell them you'll set up Bitpay for $100-$500 depending on how interested they are>take 5 mins to set it up for them>buy them a "bitcoin accepted here" sticker>repeat>repeat>repeat>now your local news stations give the trend media attention>people start to wonder if they should get in to btc>more normies>system builds on itself and you profit directlydo this, it has worked for me so far
no it didn't stupid idiot, businesses are sometimes and usually ones means of a way of living, not all but most.
And they will say they are to scared.
Unless its a big city no business will accept it, the only way is to have conversation with the business owner and bring up bitcoin, it will then be them who will set it up, without any suggestion.Also, particle is better.
>be me, go into local coffee shop with free wifi>bitcoin accepted sticker on door>whip out iphone, buy mocha frap with bitcoin because hipster.png>$26 transaction fee>still standing at register fumbling with phone as spaghetti falls out of my pockets hrs later they are closing, still no block confirmation
be black>forget I need to pay transaction fees
And this is why I support BCH.
I've done it for six restaurants so far, given the first client was a former client I made a website for and do social media management for as wellknow nothing about btc>see the sticker, throw some money inall publicity is good publicity at this point
Get my coffee>Go home>BTC has mooned again, the coffee ended up costing 100 dollarsWhen will you fags learn bitcoin is not a payment system, it's wealth storage.
Wanting to buy thing in bitcoin is like wanting people to accept gold buillion.
He doesn't realize the opportunity cost of buying coffee with BTC is the same as USD
43221974322151you lads are missing the pointit's a publicity stunt for said businesses, not something they actually expect to use/make money onthey become the first in your area to accept btc, attention follows
Yeah except right in the fucking white paper is says it is a peer to peer electronic cash system.
It doesn't say Bitcoin is a store of value fucking tard blockstream wants it to be a store of value to make money off its users pushing them off chain
Nice man!4322171Sounds awesome!What if you buy coffee, get home, it crashes $100, boy good thing you sold some btc for that $3 coffee, now you can buy back in lower and get even more btc back like $3.80 of btc.Now someone can create a coin that somehow exploits this opp and for business not to worry about consumer paying fee's or wait time.
kinda like how amazon re-imburses if prices drop after 20 days or something.
Satoshi is an infallible god>The whitepaper is basically the QuranStop being part of a cult and learn to look at the facts, bitcoin is not suitable as a payment system, it has volatility and scalability issues.
do this>a month later nobody has paid in btc>owner is furious that you scammed him for $100-$500>he sends hitmen after yougood idea OP
hi, i want to buy this dollar item please>>sure matey, that'd be one dollar>do you accept bitcoin?>>sure, we spend 500 dollars on a technician that get us into it>okay, then how much in bitcoin>>that'd be 23 dollars, please>never mind, take the dollar>>alrighty then
BTC in its current state is useless for retail payments.
Unless BitPay got it figured out somehow
