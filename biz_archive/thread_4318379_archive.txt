Do we buy back now?
Is BTC back on course or is it a bull trap of sorts?I'm unironically thinking about buying BTC now but keeping it all on an exchange just to be safe if I need to switch it quickly for something else if anything happens.
Should I?
monero.
Roger Ver still hasn't dumped his BTC yet
BTC will not be able to move very soon.
Make your decisions wisely.
Maybe he wont now that bch is justed.
Maybe he was just playing it safe?
For a while, sure, but what then?
Or should I just stay in ETH?Well, that's something to be aware of.
Don't some exchanges allow for instant transactions between users, though?
Maybe I could just buy on an exchange.
Fuck Im trapped in ETH ETH/BTC is fucking freefall Skeleton do something so I can buy back BTC
200,000 unconfirmed transactions, i havent gotten mine after 3 days of waiting, what do you think?
you should be buying the bcc dip, whales are not going to let it sit here after hitting .42, core is dead
