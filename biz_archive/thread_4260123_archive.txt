my entire life is being JUSTed at the moment, and im fucking over it
if you're getting JUSTED right now you need to re-evaluate your crypto investments.
everything should look green on your holdfolio right now after the segwit retreat.
Let me guess: NULLS?
>Bought Nuls at 0.13 BNB yesterday and sold at 0.15>Folio only up 1% today on my alts
GET IN LOSERS NULS is going to $5 >with or without you>the prophecy
missed out confido by not having enough eth = lost a potential of 28eth>link back under 2000>BTC not fallingand for that reason, im out
Confido price is inflated right now because the first days it was on etherdelta only.
Let's see the real price once it hits other exchanges.
whatever that means is all nicebut i had a whitelisted account for stage 2 and if i had 2 eth now it would be 30just fucking kill me already, end it for me
>was thinking of buying vtc last night because it was looking good >decided against it because fagwit was no doubt going to make it continue to drop until the 16thFuck every fork
always buy vtc.
always
wrong.
RCN :(
vtc confirmed eth best combogained 2 eth trading vert
Why?I'm right
