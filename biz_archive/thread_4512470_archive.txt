How hard is it to create a bot to catch dumps?
if(low){BUY BUY BUY}
It's that easy?
predicting randomness
Uses JavascriptFag.
It's quite easy, and quite effective.
I built a bot that spitballs random data associations, uses them as buy and sell signals, takes the best performing ones and breeds them to create better signals.
So I evolve technical indicators over time.
With great consistency, the best performers end up being ones that tell my robot to buy the dip and sell at ~5% profit.
I've been live algo trading using one of those indicators for 3 weeks now and my portfolio is up 44% as of an hour ago.Literally buying the dip just requires something like: "is the moving average of the last X candles Y% lower than the moving average of the last (X+Z) candles?
If yes buy."
javascripti don't even know what javascript looks like but this is pretty common in C, C++, and Java
doesnt even need to be that complicated.if(dropped10%inlasthour){buy(5%); // where function param is sell at gain %}
MAs are helpful to avoid blips.
ie, if my bot had used that logic and read POT as it was crashing from its 5x pump at 5:07PM yesterday, it would have bought in just in time to lose 50% and never recover.
MAs give some momentum to price movement (which is why they're used in... you guessed it... momentum oscillators)
touche, I was being super simplewas going to mention adding layers of complexity until you are happy with your success rate> adding stop loss (ie sell at 5% gain, or sell 2% loss with possibility of re-buy) > if (gained more than 100% in last week) do not buythat said I do like your MA idea, what params on what timeslice do you use if you dont mind?
(ie exponential and last 50, on 30min?
etc)
anon, can you tell us more about this?
what language and libraries did you use?
could you share some resources on this sort of genetic algorithm?i'd like to program a bot like that but i just got into coding a couple of months ago
Ive been trading myself and I'm up 119% this month.
Fuck a bot.
