hey fellasWant to know your opinion on Dragonchain.
This is a blockchain platfrom that was used by Disney internally and then released for a public ICO which raised 16 million USD.
Currently it is being audited and tokens are expected to be released in about 2 weeks.
As for me, it has all signs of a successfull ICO.
Prove me wrong pls.
