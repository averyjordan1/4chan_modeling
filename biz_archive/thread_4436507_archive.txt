Translation: This is your last chance to join the pump&dump before we dump!
CatalogI didn't Dump when we broke 45, and I'm not Dumping when we break 50, I'm going to hold these bags until we break at least 100, and then I'll sell 1/2 maybe.
And last week they were shilling "You will never get BCH under 1500 again"Remember guys pajeets always use the same type of shilling.
I'm not shilling, or a Pajeet, I have faith.
That's big news, should we let the Chinese know about this?
Considering they haven't given NEO a fucking second glance on their exchanges.
You dumb fuckers will hold bags on Monday when you realize it was all a hype pump lmao.
Sell now while you still can
I bought them at 3.5 ...
I'm still up and I still have faith.
Remember when you guys said ETH wouldn't break $50, and then $100, and then $200, remember when you said ETH was a shit coin and we were bag holders?
Wha the fkkk are u stupid?Or u want peeps to hold bags?
This will cool off.. sell re enter low 30's..
That's the thing anon, Neo doesn't hype pump.
The fact that they did means this shit is going to explode
No one is going to let this go to low 30s before the news you retard.
Because if the news is true this will be $100 next week.
HODL
if the news nobody knows about is trueyou realize how insane you sound, right?
Why does it sound insane?
It's the truth.
