>bitcoin goes up>alts go down>bitcoin goes down>alts still go down

It's almost like one is caused by the other and is entirely predictable...
when you are referring to "bitcoin" do you mean bitcoin cash or bitcoin classic?
>bitcoin stagnates>altcoins go upThis is common sense anon.When bitcoin goes down, people lose faith in all of crypto and start converting altcoins to bitcoins and selling them for cash.When bitcoin goes up, people sell their altoins because the altcoin value is going down relative to bitcoin and they don't want to lose money.
Best time to buy altcoins is when bitcoin is going up and best time to sell is when bitcoin is stagnant.
This, it's annoying as fuck though.
The only fucking choice you have in this market is selling alts the moment Bitcoin goes up or down.
It's annoying as fuck and a self fulfilling prophecy.There is a way to get more money with alts, if you buy them and they moon for another reason.
Like a new thing coming out, feature being added...
fuck off roger
