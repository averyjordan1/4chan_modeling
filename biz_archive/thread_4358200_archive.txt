ARghhhhI've been waiting for ETH to go back down to $290/300 but now I'm FOMOing hard.
buy now or hold my ground?
% up10%down20%upand so on from here onall in
I sold my eth for btc just before the btc dip,why do I always make the wrong moves
See you at 500
you literally had a whole month to buy, you don't deserve the gains
I'm 45% in ETH, so my unbiased opinion is you should go all in at 1000% market cost.
more like 300
Buy high while you still can
