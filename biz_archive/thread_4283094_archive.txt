>Initiated in 2016, Bitcoin Classic's stated goal was to increase bitcoin's transaction capacity by raising the block size from 1MB to 2MB, however, it failed to gain traction among the cryptocurrency's global software users.What does this even have to do with Bitcoin?
It's just another shitcoin like bcash, b2x and so on
Delusional Cashies
Uhh... this is it.
My chance to become a whale.
Just went 90% in on BCH.A nobrainer, if even clients actually turn around on the Core.
