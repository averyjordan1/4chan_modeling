>tfw i fell for the "work hard get rich scheme">tfw all i had to do was to buy some imaginary internet money back in 2010 for 200$I literally missed out the one in a lifetime chance to get rich.
Feels very fucking bad.
Buy ETH, XMR and some BTC and still make out pretty good.
LINK is my last hope.
I will eat cockroaches and bottomfeed for as many years as I need to, HODL!!!!
just buy some imaginary internet money in 2017 for 200$ and wait till 2024
I literally missed out the one in a lifetime chance to get rich.Nope, you missed out on Ethereum and countless other coins too.
Even Stratis was like $.01 a year ago.
Ark was like $.20 6 months ago.
Which ones??
