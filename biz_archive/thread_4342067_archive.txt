I want to get into crypto.
Thinking of going in on ETH and ETP.
Maybe BTC when this BCH nonsense blows over.
Am I a brainlet?
the fuck is that wojack
No need to wait on BTC, everyone knows it will always be king
These memes keep evolving to depict less and less intelligence.
I think you mean BCH.
etp
What's wrong with ETP?
Based on the technical aspects and the fact that more exchanges are about to support it, it seems undervalued.
I'd tread lightly if I were you, we don't like logic around these parts, just memes.
if you did this wojak, i would like to applaud you, it's very artistic and i particularly enjoyed the water dish mouth
whats on top tho?
a volcano or something?
i dont get it
