The main benefit of being a millionaire is lack of worry about money.
This doesn't mean you live lavishly.
In fact, most millionaires have a less expensive lifestyle than much of the middle-class.
But it's impossible to overstate the value of the peace of mind that comes with an abundance mentality.
I'm stuck at 400k for month now.
getting up when you want to is the best thing about it
