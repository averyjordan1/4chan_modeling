For everyone who got into BCH and have made upwards of 30%, when do we get out?At the end of the day BCH will crash we just need to maximize profits before we abort.
a deserter.
There is no out.
We're going to make bitcoin great again.
4540882Idiots it's just a fake scheme of fud.BCH will shit the bed
BCH 6 lanes not 8you had one job, memer
Look guys!
we went from 1mb block to 10!!
This will surely scale in the future!
fucking idiots.
why not just use dash or litecoin.
BCH is a shitcoin but its big
Around 1900s for me
At the end of the day BCH will crashNot necessarily.
If BCH and BTC reach close to parity while BTC chain is choking and people are scared, BTC will have mass panic sales, in part because people will expect others to mass panic sell.
At that point the flippening becomes real.I expect some back and forths though.
The big dicks in the game might even sell BCH at some points to drop it a bit to prevent it from rising too fast, then rebuying some 100-200USD lower and continuing the rise.
They did that last time until bithumb went fucking nuts and skyrocketed it to above 2600USD in no time and then got ddos'd.
Great.
If you're dumb enough to think that you'll be in BTC getting JUST'd while the chain freezes up,which you clearly deserve.
this.
after a chain freeze you are pretty much fucked.
You are lucky if you don't have any btc in a wallet right now.
Because it's already to move it out by now.
The blocks will never reach enough confirmation to be transferred to an exchange.
Game over for all btc holders
U too impatient
