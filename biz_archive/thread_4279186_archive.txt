Seriously what the fuck?
I was just scrolling through coinmarketcap and saw this abomination of a coin.
Look at that fucking chart.
It's being manipulated harder than a modern German.
This is why bitcoin alts will inevitably be outlawed.
We are in the wild west days of cryptocurrency.
Holy fuck dude thats a neet daytraders wet dream
Haha I saw that one this morning when I was scrolling to see what to put my ETH in.
When you think about, someone, sometime is going to get burned if they follow the order book and will probably fuck up and buy the lowest ASK which might run during a pump.
Just look at that time frame near the end there where it stays at 0.04 for a bit.
Maybe if you can catch the train real low and ride to 0.04 you can come out with 4x-5x, but I wouldnt bet on it lol
