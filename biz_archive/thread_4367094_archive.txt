alts have not moved in 2 monthsOh, really anon?
Because unless you were living under a rock, all alts crashed and are still at -50% from before the forks
nobody in crypto is stop posting this everyday

Vitalik cuckerin
>best market in centuries>getting JUSTedNope, least not such as I'd admit
I'm not, because I bought BlockMason instead of being a justed dipshit
Bought POWR yesterday as soon as it was added to bittrex, just recovered the massive losses i took on bch, and the moon ride hasnt even started
Literally how?like every coin is in the green
So you bought at 2.0 btc
I'm just happy that for most of us here getting JUST'd means missing a moonshot or losing part of our gains.
Majority of us are still well up over our initial investment or what the stock market would have gained
I bought it at almost peak then weakhands a few hours ago from anger.
I bought bch at .35, could have sold at .31 when it pumped again twice but didnt, then went to .19, then pumped to .24 and i didnt sold expecting the big pump that never came, finally i sold all at .18 and put all in on powr, im on the green now
AHHHH
