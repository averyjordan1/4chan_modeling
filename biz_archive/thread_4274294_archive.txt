coinbase or cexio?
setting up my first wallet, need help buds
please don't use a browser wallet, that ends in tragedy, use electrum instead
better for it to be program based?
thanks bud
Yes, just so that you may easily create backups, and aren't reliant on someone's server being functional/available, also it limit your exposure to attack surfaces within your browser
sweet so where do i buy from now?
heard fees are retardedly high from coinbase.
im just trying to hop on the chainlink train soon.
