when do u take profits?i'm up 400% on initial investment.
part of me wants to keep trading, now that i have more to trade with i can make more, but other part of me knows i should take some profit desu...
All around me are familiar faces
cash out a small percentage every X days, it's all up to you
worn out places, worn out faces
Can someone please explain to me what is wrong with his boobies

you mean fiat ?
do you actually need money ?I'm trading since I bought btc in 2013 and never took anything back because I have more in fiat and other shit than in cryptos still.if you just want some shit irl why not, but being frugal is healthy for your mind and body
