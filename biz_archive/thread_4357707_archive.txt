I HAVE LIKE 100$ OF BITCOIN ON MY CPINBASE ACCOUNTHOW DO I SWAP THIS SHIT TO BITCOIN CASHI KNOW I CAN USE SHAPESHIFT BUT I DON'T HAVE A BCH WALLETHELP
Get a BCH wallet then mateGet Exodus Wallet.
Supports BTC and BCH and you can do a ShapeShift conversion directly within the wallet and it will input it all to the website for you automatically.
GET BCH ANON QUICKMOON HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
Coinomi wallet can do this as well directly from the app
sell it for usd, buy ethereum, send ethereum to binance and buy bcc with it
Op dont buy the pedo coin.
You can do the same with your bitcoin
It's actually really simple:>download to a desktop wallet>wipe all other backup wallets <<THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT for separating your BCH from existing legacy BTC>delete your system32 folder and reboot>wait four monthsCongratualations: you now have exactly the same net worth as everyone else who held BCH into Q2 2018!
This is definitely the easiest way OP!!!
Saves the hassle and drama
Uh oh prepare to be poor bud
