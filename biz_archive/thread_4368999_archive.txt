who /holding comfy/?
looks to me like we're in a very healthy consolidation pattern that could break out as early as tomorrowthings to watch:http://bchflippening.com/https://fork.lol/
Well BTC just did a triple top so it is looking pretty rosy for BCH right now.
The DAA is ironing out the difficulty too.
Good time for Roger to unleash the BTCs.
Panic sold all my BCH when it first came out and was dropping hard.
I'm was a fucking idiot and I hope Ive learned my lesson...
Lucky for you that must have been on bittrex right?
You would have sold pretty high and bought your hedge back at around 3-400 right?
looks like corecoin broke the triple top upwards to me, but on really weak volume, so it could easily be a bull trap
