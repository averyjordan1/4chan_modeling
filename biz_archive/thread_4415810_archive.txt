I unironically believe in iexec and chainlink based on my own reading but though they've been meme'd.
When do I get in?
What's your strategy for finding an entry point?ChainLink has tons of bagholders from the pump.
How do I know when they've been shaken out?
It's at probably the lowest point it's been.
I think now around 2k sats is a good time to buy.
So I put some in.
At the last alt recovery, LINK went above 3k sats.
Thats enough profit for meThen again it could go lower.
I'm tired of trying to time it
I'm in for at least a year with my holds, no trading tbqh.I'm thinking of buying LINK near ICO and then doubling down near half-ICO, but it's not really that big of a deal if I miss it entirely.
