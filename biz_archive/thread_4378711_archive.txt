In Crypto since August.> tfw haven't beaten bitcoin price rise> tfw haven't beaten the boomer S&P500> tfw made less than NEETs on government handoutsI've honestly just made no fucking money and I invested in good alts.
What the fuck is going on?
Not to brag, but my stock portfolio bested the s&p for the first time this year 34% to 18%.
It only took me 5 years but fuck I feel like a god.
We got into crypto at the same time though, and I've pretty much broke even here
joined at the end of august and i've broken even as well
Nice.
Over-weighted in tech stocks?
I invested in good alts.protip: hype is everything in crypto, it doesn't mean SHIT if a project is good or even viable.
i lost MASSIVE amounts of profits because i "believed in the tech".
if something moons, sell when the hype starts fading even a bit.
a huge red flag is when a coin doesn't move, even when there's good news.
don't be an idiot like me and keep holding bags of shit while bitcoin keeps going up.
