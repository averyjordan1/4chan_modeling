So I know this is old news to everybody, but coinbase is fucking garbage.
How do I never use this company again?
What wallets does everyone use and where can I get some of this 2x fork or am I just too late?
Use GDAX it's owned by coin base but no fees if you put in limit orders, only thing that sucks is it takes about a week for funds to go in
Try using Bitstamp instead.
Coinbase lagged it on my deposit.
How long does it take for funds to get in
4408167Thanks I'll look into bitstamp.
My bank just stopped letting me use instant deposit on coinbase and I also missed out on 2k free money from the bch pump because of coinbase.
So I'm looking for alternatives.
Also I have a gdax account but I would not like to leave my money on the exchange.
I was looking at the exodus wallet.
Does anyone have an opinion about exodus?
