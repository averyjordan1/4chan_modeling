 tfw when got in on req at the bottom and already up 60%

Can't speak for the other's but Link is being mass shilled here for many good reasons.
It could very well be the future for the majority of electronic money transfers & is in talks with the fortune 500s that could make it happen.
Keep holding, you don't want to miss the day a partnership is announced.>Either way use this diagram as a general trading guideline.
It will help in the future.
