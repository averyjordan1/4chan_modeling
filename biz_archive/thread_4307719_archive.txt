What's going on here?
How do these shitcoin pumps work and is there way to make money off them?
Volume is too low.
That's why you get the high %'s.
You can't earn money because you can't liquidate.
volume $65just spend $65 and sell to yourself you can pump your own shitcoin 3000%
You're literally looking at bait.
If you even considered buying any of them for more than a nanosecond you need to get the fuck out of any markets and go back to watching american Idol on the fucking double.
Shitcoin pump alert.Shitcoins exchanges to add BCH as a base market to trade shitcoins, it will be huge.
