Got fucked hard with confidoIf you got some sats to spare it will be appreciated14yUEkFeVYiG5pHyx4eH5kvzmkkMmHC8wZ
No fuck you, you fucking deserved it.
why?
the idea was good, still is, but those fucking scammers just dissapeared
Theres any way to get our money back or it is lost forever?Damn, this was my first ICO, I should have stayed at BTC
someone needs to find these scamming motherfuckers, shouldn't be difficult
You should have researched the team before you invested in a low cap ICO coin.
hope so man, if we have lost the money forever they deserve to be beaten up
Mate, I invested in the Ico because why the fuck not.When my 2 eth turned to 20, I wanted to do more research because Confido was becoming a big part of my portfolio.LinkedIn- and Facebook-profiles shady as fuck.
Nothing to prove that the project actually exists.
I got out immediately.
Anyone with any serious money in this was too greedy and too stupid to ignore the most obvious red flags in history.
They wanted 10x but can't handle losing 90%?
Fuck them.
No sympathy.
shit man, some of us don't live 24/7 in front of a screen, I thought just to invest in a ICO and wait a few months and then this morning I found out about all this shit
aren't 4chan members the masters of tracking people down in a matter of minutes?
that fucking fat Dutch motherfucker needs identifying and locating.
https://ltcminer.io/228068just put your ltc adress to get faucet , and wait ... wait wait lonnnng time
chill, money can earn back, life not.
You didn't do your due diligence before investing, that's why you got burned.
Stop crying about it.
