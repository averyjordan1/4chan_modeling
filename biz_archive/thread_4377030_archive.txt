It's not fair, lads.
It's just not fair.
The baddies are winning!
You told me if I kept the faith and followed the teachings of the holy Satoshi that my bags would be safe in eternity and I would have a place on the moon at the right hand of Jihan himself.But BTC is on a run and is laying a dark, sticky poop all over the sleeping face of my beautiful BCash gains.
How did this happen??
Again?!!!!!
I WAS TOLD TO HOLD BTC!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm fucking tired of this shitshow.
If I had just bought Bitcoins and hold them I would have made more money than gambling in fucking altcoinsFUCK.
I started with 1.30 BTC it was worth around 3-4k$ now I have 8k$ but 1.10 BTC AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH I'VE JUST FUCKING LOST MY TIME TRADING SHITCOINS
