Does anyone know a good guide or video about controlling your emotions during trading?I've got a good thing going, but I always demolish my profits with a shitty FOMO every now and again
moshe moshe help me out desu

>controlling your emotionsIf you're a brainlet, don't even bother.
what are your goals?
just holding?
if so, dont look at them every day.
it helps
the less you care the better,seems like you already failed this since you care too much
After many months of holding through trades that lose 80-90% and others thst go to 1000%, I can tell you that you simply stop feeling pain at all after a point.

listening to his book now
Lose more money until ice goes through your veins.And always remember that money is a social construct and doesn’t actually mean shit.
Practice meditation.
Learn to find your center.
Also toughening your skin with losses will condition you to success.
ok I will remember that when I need to pay my billsday trading+ swing tradingI've made a good strat, but some days are extremely slow and no opportunities show up.
It's on those day I get itchy hands and stupidly FOMO my shit up on something pumping
If you’re trading with your bill money, no wonder you are emotional as fuck.
You’re breaking rule #1.
2 hoursAlright I'll give it a watch
Ps.
If there’s no opportunity that day, don’t trade.
