Is there a wallet similar to Coinbase that lets me buy and sell BCH as easily?
Coinbase will be adding bch in January
i use bittrex (its called bcc cause that was the original ticker before the change).its arguably shit, but its worked well for me so far
One that you should keep your BCH on for any significant amount of time?
No.
What do you mean?
I need to buy my goat a trampoline.
He really wants one.
I want to try and make enough to get him one and I unfortunately didn't buy enough BTC to afford a good one
I wanna buy in before that happensI've found one called Kraken, any good?
