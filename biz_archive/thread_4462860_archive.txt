chinese moot allows one thread on each board to be dedicated to how to improve the state of the boardI have some suggestions on what we can do.1.
Ban everyone who posts thier fucking wallet adress for 30 days
Agreed.
agreed, in fact I have mentioned this improvement myself
agreed
Suggestion: Ban everyone who posts "sexy babes".
goes without saying.
pic related.
Or put up flags.
It's already forbidden to beg on the board, the mods just don't give a fuck
disagreed
Just ban the OP's that initiate a wallet spamming thread based on rolling when OP never delivers in that format.
Especially those "roll x and give me x" threads, people spamming their addresses for absolutely nothing but they are too dumb to realise it.People need to post wallets for verification purposes and some legitimate promotional coin giveaways like Per Annum last week.
Not only should begging be banned, but reverse begging should be banned as well, i.e saying that you want to give free shit
