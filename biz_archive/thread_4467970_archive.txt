What's the best way to get into crypto?
Coinbase and HODL BTC/LTC/ETH
Should have done this the whole time, trading is a meme
Know of a good alternative to coinbase/localbitcoins (high fees)?
Make an address with MyEtherWalletBuy ETH through something like coinbaseTransfer ETH from coinbase to your ETH address
Buy oversold coins (top 20) that are about to get bullish and sell them when they are getting overbough and are about to get bearish.
(1 hour or 4 hour chart)Repeat.
If you are aiming for 10-20x moon missions right now, you are better off going to vegas.
That was my plan.
What exchange do you use?
>what's the best way to get into crypto?Wait until next year and then pay 10x as muchNormies like you deserve to pay many times what early adopters paid
My main worry is legal stuff and taxes.
How do you guys deal with it?
I'm a burger btw.
right now bittrex because I ALWAYS set stoplosses.
I prefer to get rekt by a small dip, instead of waking up and looking at a dumped coin that went -30% overnight.Also, only come here for the lols.
If you want to learn anything, look op good (non shill) youtubers.
This place is a pajeet shill fest.
A fucking awesome opportunity: 
Where do you set stop loss relative to entry?
Depends on the volatility of the coin.
On top 6 coins I go for the support line desu
And when do you enter?What's less risky, entering at resistance thinking it'll break through (hey it's already rising) or entering at support to exit at resistance?
