Hey guys, it's your annoying Plus500 CRAZY platinum guy here.Here's some questions I get asked:>Plus500 is CFD, CFDs are a high risk-high reward stocks, I use plus 500 because the UI is easy as FUCK to use, responsive and good for a shitter like myself, and it works on phones nicely so I can trade while I'm at work.>Fuck off with your pennies.No son, you can make a few $100,000 through leverage, and I'm posting this shit so other people can make some cash too, so no need to be hostile.I know there's others using this ap, and I've helped a couple of people already and it's nice to make a thread and see people doing well.>Why platinumPlatinum is a commodity, it will never tank in our life time and it's stable enough to use, I have noticed in the past year and a bit it's been going between $900-$1000 so, we can take advantage of this situation.This weeks been pretty good we're at $930 and it's been fluctuating between $920-936, which means it's going to go REAL soon to $1000.I did not expect it to have some blockage but it's good for making a few thousand $ overnight.This weeks all about breaking that $940 barrier, so it's going to continue to dip to $920-$936 until it break ti.Remember In about 6 hours, platinum starts being traded rapidly, on nights it's been going back up to $936 this week, it's at $930 now so we might see $942 tonight, due to the cost being already at $930.It could always swing back down, It hasn't tanked back down to $900 like I've been saying so that's something to keep in mind.
I already fucking bought CFDI'm strapped in already dude
Good stuff.Remember if you see it going down don't sell, rather short another position then sell it when it's at about $924 from $930 then that will give you a buffed so by the time it's back up to $930 you're making some cash back due to error.I used that technique and had about $24,000 from a $3000 trade in a matter of months, I lost it due to trial and error though, and greed but I've since gotten better.
Were you the guy from the other night last week that said "When it hits $930 go balls deep, got it"?.In pic related we can see that it's tried to tank again on nov 3 which was friday, which often plat will do as predicted last week.4th of november was a tank to $918 but it's recovering up and down slowly on an uptrend.On the 7th of november it looks like someone brought up because gold and others are doing better and have gone up, so people are buying this.Then people have slowly sold it off now we're at a mid week up trend, which should hit $940 tonight because it's wednes day and plat downtrend doesn't really start till thursday/friday, so we have that free night available where people aren't spooked to sell or tank it.Which is why we see an uptrend today I'm pretty sure.We could also see a nice curve down if it doesn't rise quickly tonight, back down to $922 then up again early next week to increase the max which is $938 at the moment.We broke that $930 barrier so it knows it can do it now so it's going to go slowly up, I see no reason for it to tank, if it does it'll bounce back because platinum loves $900-$1000 bracket.We've also been at this $900-$930 bracket for a month and a bit, it's time that it moons a bit like it's been previously doing.
A tip for if you're going to try and wave ride.1 stock costs about $300, which 5-10% of that is a instant loss so you have to cater for -50cents on the actual stock.A good time to buy/sell is sell at 33% of what you place so 1 stock @ $300 means you want to close it at about $100 then short the position to ride it back up, I've done this a few times and made my way from $300 back to $1200 in a few hours.You can always hold it and then set your loss to $100 if it's at about $220 or something so it'll sell at what you expect, if you wanted to try and ride a rocket ship from $920 to $935.Buying a position at $931 which it's at now, cause it's going UP, 40 ounces at $320 spent means when it hits $951 (+$20 difference) means I take home $1045 profit, so it's roughly winning * 3 so, every $1 platinum goes up, that's $52.25 that's about 16% every $1 which is damn nice.I must apologize to those of you who follow my advice and make it, when you know that you made $200 in 5 minutes, a whole days wage, you begin to reevaluate life and working for $20 an hour becomes meaningless.
One last bump, any questions?
