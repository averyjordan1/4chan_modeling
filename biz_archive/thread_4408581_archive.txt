>is try to sink our shit.
What can us plebs do?
They're more likely to short an unknown to them like crypto.
better they make money on the way down than miss on the way up.
Have fiat and be ready to buy.
That's not how it works dumbass.Shorting the future is done in cash does not affect price of BTC.
Why the fuck does Wall St get to gamble anyway?
It seems really fucked up to bet on commodities going up or down just for the hell of it.
>I'm going to short BTC for lots of money>'WOW.
All that BTC got dumped at the last minute.
No way.
Who could have predicted that?'

Exhibit number 1:>Downgrade stock>Buy stock>Upgrade stock>ProfitExhibit 2:>Sell $50 call options>Pin price (see: pinning the strike) at $49.99 on expiration date>Options expire worthless>Profit
So where's the price going to pin at?
my guess is it's going to be a shitshow.
We need to be prepared.
Stupid question but why does futures even effect the price of BTC if they aren't actually buying/selling coins and basically just making private side bets on the side for what the price might become?
Is it just because it's assumed that actual coin traders will look to what the majority ,or futures bet on to determine their own prices?
