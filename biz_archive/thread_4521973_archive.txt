A heads up to all you pajett Bitcoin cash buyers.
When coinbase releases all the bitcoin cash to its customers the price is going to plummet!
it will pump first
how the fuck will it pump first you moron?
you realize something like 90% of holders will sell asap.
no one is going to be buying into it compared to selling it once they get the chance to sell.
The price will crash hard.
Coinbase represents more than 31% of all bitcoincash coins.
When they going to release?
IDK.
but when they do release sell all your bitcoincash ASAP.
Why sell something that is going up so quickly 8n value?
It's amazing some people think a sudden increase in BCH supply will positive affect the coin.
We don't even know if Coinbase will be selling BCH or just allowing withdrawls (which is the only confirmed thing right now)
If it becamse buyable/sellable on Coinbase the price would skyrocket.
If it is only withdrawals it will tank.
unless the flippenning happens this weekend, in which case BTC will be dead by Jan 1( when coinbase are going to release the BCH)
more scare tactics, old news
As soon as coinbase releases the large sums of BTC to flood the market the price is going down by at least 80%.
Supply >> demand.
Get in and get your profit then GTFO
to be honest i agree, this should pump hard tonight and friday, followed by a massive dump.
so yea, get out after the pump lads
