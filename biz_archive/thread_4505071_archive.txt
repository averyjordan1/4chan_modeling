I'm still trying to accumulate this coin and I don't need some retards on /biz/ to pump this for a quick buck
 thinly veiled pump post
This seems like a good opportunity.
The company seems legit
Im a newfag to crypto should I go all in on this?
Chart seems alright
Even if it is a pretty good investment, you should never go all in!
So my recommendation is that you go in 10%, and then later 10%, and again 10% to dollar cosst average, and be 30% invested at max.
You do not need to invest much anyway as the return will be asymetric to your initial investment!!!
That's the beauty of it!!
