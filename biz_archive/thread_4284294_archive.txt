Hey /biz/, over the past three months I found a crazy phenomenon that could REALLY help some of you get into crypto without even having any money to invest.here's what I started doing:>find higher-class businesses in progressive areas of town(think upscale with lots of college-age kids or young adults)>get these businesses' emails>make yourself look a LOT smarter than you actually are, especially when it comes to crypto>tell them you can put their business on the map, if not through sales then through media attention by allowing them to accept bitcoin as a payment>charge them $250-$500 to set up bitpay>profitIf you have good people skills, can explain how bitcoin works to people, and look like you know what you're talking about, rich boomers will shovel money in your general direction.If you don't believe me, go around hyde park and other fancy places in South Tampa, FL in a week or so; I bought a bunch of "BTC Accepted here" sticker for all the businesses I've worked with in the pastHas anyone else had success with this or something similar?
Really curious to see.
ok stay poor
