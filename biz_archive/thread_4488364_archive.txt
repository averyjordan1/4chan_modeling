what do you wish you knew back then that you know now that could have made you end up alot wealthier
buy BCH
oh really now
Get an associates degree
in what
I would fuck more girls
this.
High school girls were easy level.
graduated in 2010wish I had known about Bitcoin in 2010could have mined the shit out of it>sadpepe.jpg
Obviously just buy bitcoin.
This question is a no-brainer and is literally why the kikes that are in power right now invent a time-machine in 2030 so they can go back in time, tell their past selves to buy enough bitcoin to make them rich, and then come back and be rich, take all that money, give it to their past selves, so that their past selves would have been rich enough to put themselves in power in the first place.
This is literally every global elite, they were all in on the time machine thing.
i dont regret avoiding std's
Not to treat school as serious and to not pursue college.Start in the career I am in now then (only internet neccesary).Buy crypto of course but that is easy.Not to be shy around girls and to welcome the advances I got from tonnes of them with open trousers.Stay away from crazy girls on nights out etc, be more reserved.
Also to buy 100 copies of 'Death Grips - Ex Military' on vinyl when it was released instead of only buying one of them.Also to buy a bunch of Pokemon Base set booster boxes, preferably 1st edition.
I would quit high school and work 24/7 on my own business
I really wish I could go back to highschool, even a freshmanthere is no way I would allow myself to not be wealthy by the time I ended up 18
