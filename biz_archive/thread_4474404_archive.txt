DELET THIS
w-what about LRC
MUHHH LRCI FUCKING KNEW THIS WAS A SCAM SHIT COIN, I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT POWR WHEN IT WAS FUCKING .28 cents>MUH HIDDEN GEM MUHH RINHGGDGfuck all of you
jesus fucking christ, calm down and say it again in english
Not sure about LRC, its listed in weekly COZ report as being used by NEX but not in the NEX whitepaper
Look in the sources bracket 18, they are indeed using lrc but lrc can cut into exchanges profits so lrc is great regardless
I see that now thx
