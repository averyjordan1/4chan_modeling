New to this board but come to ask advice from your expertise.
Is there any real benefit to buying from independent companies?
Independent companies to me offer higher risk in terms of warranties, no problem standard, higher prices.
Unless I need a specialist service that only a local independant company can perform, I tend to go for the lowest price at the appropriate quality.Please educate me, I can't find anything but propaganda.
Shameless self-bump.If I am on the wrong board, please tell me which board to head to.
Other then feeling good about helping someone local, there isnt much point.
If they cant remain competitive with prices why would you spend more money on them unless its specialist like you said already.
No point, too late, we get what we're given now
Thank you for your replies.
I was worried I was missing something in my ignorance.
Is this the best board to ask on about budget planning etc ?
in terms of rupees yes
