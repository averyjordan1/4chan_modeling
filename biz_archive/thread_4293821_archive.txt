>alts recovering>bch going to shit>everything is back to normalman you guys are petty alarmists holy shit
Wait until tomorrow, btc is going to 5000 and alts are going to get massacred
Lol you have no idea what's in store for BTC.
They (the miner oligarchy pushing BCH) haven't even abandoned the BTC chain to stall with many many hours of transaction time yet.
They're also spending every single transaction fee on the BTC right now on accumulating BCH.Eventually they'll have enough and leave BTC to die.BTC soon has a queue of 100 000 unconfirmed transactions and people are complaining about the ridiculous fees and transaction times.
Wait until the hashing power switches to BCH.I'll say it now.
BTC, omae wa shindeiru.
Bch to 2k
u think this is over?
