Here's some free TA, I usually charge $250/hour for this.Downward decline at lesser slope than middle rise, first decline at faster equal slope.
Looks like the inflection points have minimal modality.
There isn't a down hammer before the 3rd red candle which indicates the cross pattern lightly.
Few stabilization points, and no record portrayal.
Clear cut lack of resistance.It's gonna drop 50%.
Get out.
