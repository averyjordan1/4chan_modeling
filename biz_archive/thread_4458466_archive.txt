Guys the NEO news probably won't drop until during or after the Swissnex event that is happening in 4 hours in Shanghai, of which Da Hongfei is a mod during the panel.
Plenty of time to get this bitch pumpin.
Just remember NEO has never teased news like this and has never made announcements for announcements, so it's something big.
It may not be about Chinese regulations but that doesn't mean that it doesn't involve the Chinese gov't.
The fact that neo dumped a bit just now when btc did a micropump makes me thing that this might be fucking nothing.
If someone has info about this being big why the fuck would you sell to go to btc unless it skyrockets to 8200 in 15 seconds or something like that.
Fuck these guys, stayed up all night refreshing Twitter/Reddit/4chan so i could decide to stay in or dump my NEO as soon as possible.And now you're telling me these guys are going to announce it just at the time i have to go to a meeting for 2-3 hours.Now to decide if i'll hold or dump before leaving...
Dumb money, weak hands, probably only whales and insiders have any idea what the news will be and whales ain't selling yet
Stop loss
THIS NEWS WILL MAKE ALL OF US RICH
That's how it works though.
It doesn't matter what alt it is, bitcoin goes up, the rest go down.
It dumped earlier today too because of a tweet but is back.
Just set a stop loss and try not ot worry.
I didn't even know this but Bittrex works perfect on my phone so you could technically watch it on your phone.
Btw i just checked and this event is november 21st, not today.http://www.swissnexchina.org/en/event/future-of-moneyseries-coming-to-china/
looks like i'm up all night watching neo again
Neo news is "We rebranded from antshares... now we're rebranding from Neo.
We're announcing our name change to "Chinereum", that's right western speculators who are the primary buyers and believers of this coin, we are the chinese ethereum.
Keep buying, friends."
