Ok guys here's my reasoning, tell me what you think.LINK's greatest strength is also it's greatest weakness: Bitcoin started out as a product for people but has started to become adopted by corporations, Eth started as a medium between people and corporations, when Eth was launching it had very little if any partnerships, LINK is going to complete this cycle by being the first coin basically 100% designed corporations, with heavy involvement by the corporations from day ONE.Even when ETH was created it was during a time that cryptocurrencies weren't taken remotely seriously.
Now corporations are all greasing up to enter this field.
That's why LINK can't take the route of 'pump to oblivion with hype' because YOU are not the target demographic.
And that's a good thing.The reason LINK has so much potential upside is because 99% of development really is happening behind closed doors, when VB make ETH he didn't have anywhere near the starting capital SN has, thats why he has the luxury of not shilling his product.LINK may very well fail, but if it succeeds it will be huge.
It’s main strength is being Totally shit, it’s main weakness is everything.
