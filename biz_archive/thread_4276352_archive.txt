Did I fuck up?
It's near all time lowâ€¦
no, it gets pumped once every 4-6 weeks
I read something about a big announcement, and combined with low prices, I couldn't resist.
This shitcoin is worthless and the dev team is a bunch of college broDropouts.
Good luck to u
Just like many other alt coins.
42763854276473Obvious troll retard samefag.Coin is a non-starter.
What do you mean non-starter?
This is a shit coin I too got caught up in at one time, try to break even or sell at a light loss anon its not worth the headache.
So it's always at all time lows?
No hope at all?
The fact that you're posting an image of the OLD logo leads me to believe that you've been holding bags for a while.
Nice try, paj
Nah, I just googled 1st blood and that's what google gave me.
Bittrex has the new logo, but 2lazy2get.
Holy shit, it just keeps going down.
You could have saved the logo from bittrex...
Right click save as...Also, you bought a coin that looks like a rockstar game
Save me.
