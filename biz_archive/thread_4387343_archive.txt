>tfw a corn chip gets more gains than any of your alts
what am i looking at here?
why does it cost so much?
A single corn chip with hot pepper dust on it.
Making videos of yourself became a thing on YouTube and they sold out.
Now they are worth at least 10x their original price.
are we in a hot corn chip bubble right now?
Bought like 8 last year.
Ate one.
Worth it.
Yes, sell.
