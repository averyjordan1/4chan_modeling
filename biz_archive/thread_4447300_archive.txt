I have an idea BIZ!
Let's host an ICO just to create a GAS faucet for NEO.
It just has to raise enough NEO to create 500 GAS per day, which is 1.5 million.Then we can create a GAS faucet for anyone who wants to register smart contracts on NEO.
That way we completely fuck over these greedy chinese who are trying to have a monopoly over their blockchain!
