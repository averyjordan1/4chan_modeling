I just thought of a GENIUS new coin called WATER LEDGER.We install massive bowls on the roofs of homes around the world.The bowls collect rainwater, and individuals can sell this excess water to others.It will TRULY be the first decentralized water platform.
We no longer will have to rely on centralized institutions to provide us with clean water.Holy fuck, I'm a genius.
> MFW people realize that this is exactly what Power Ledger is doing LMAO
People really will buy any shitcoin
when you make trade with your shitty gouvernment and billion dollars companies i will listen to you peasant
Why would you need a dedicated token for trading water?
Me and Rhajesh simply exchange urine with Chainlink, even though they are completely irrelevant to each other.
Please understand, there is a bill in the house here in America that is already aiming to do this for ALL solar companies in the U.S. without a fucking crypto coin being involved.
If you're buying this coin, you're a very ignorant investor.
Best of luck anon...
Yeah and it’s centealized and run by the biggest mafia in the world - the US government.
That’s like saying we already have fiat so why do we need crypto lmao
