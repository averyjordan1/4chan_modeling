AAARRRRRRRRREREHHHHHHHHHHHHH

I'm laughing so hard rn, buying a coin at ATH after ICO, when it already mooned 80%, and it was clear that ICO bagholders were going to start dumping, AND on top of that with Bitcoin on the rise.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
binance kiss of death
Got memed pretty hard on this on.
Should i just cut my losses?
don't even know what this shit is, but if it is manipulated on binance I'd say drop it asap
ico price was .35 - .50 cent's USD including presale, it has barely mooned you retardsit's actually going to be used by flight schools, and has real world use, it's not a neo but should get at least 3x - 4x out of it, cyprus btw is a big travel locatiosn with rich russians that go there.
Any idea on a timescale for that?
