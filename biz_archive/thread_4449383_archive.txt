Should I bail on Link and go into Request Network instead?
Kek if you can make good memes for REQ sure, but if not then stay in LINK.
We need meme lords in biz like you who can provide entertainment.
"no"
That's what I did.
As much as I like LINK you've got to look out for your best interest and REQ is looking like it will perform better short term.
REQ is under ICO and they have initial release sometime this quarter (within ~1 month) plus Great Wall Q1 2018.
I'm expecting to see 0.0004+ ETH by EOY.

You ever wonder why it's so hard to understand what it does?
it's bceause it does NOTHING.
it's a scam.
Iltearally holding anything other coin wouldve made u money in the last month except link.
Wanna know what's gonna moon next?
HINTLTCur welcome.
As do all who live to see such times.
I have a smal REQ stack but the problem is I don't want any out of the blue Link annoucements sending it 4X.That HCL tweet scared the trading out of me.
I don't want to be all in REQ when they come out with the network a few months early or SWIFT decides to shill them out of the blue.
hodl both in a ratio that makes you comfortable
It's really not that difficult at all to understand.
Are you a brainlet?It gets data from outside the blockchain and translates it into something that can be used on the blockchain (in a decentralized way)>LTCExcited for those 25% gains EOY 2019?
Grow some balls and take a risk on something that has the potential to at least go 10x by next year
makes me feel extra comfy the guy trashing link is an LTC holder lol that is the most amateur shitcoin out there
