Enjoy the slow bleed back to 18 cents
+8%Are you shittin me with this Mickey Mouse bullshit?
Can anyone explain gas price to me on etherdelta.
I'm confused!
REQAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
just keep 0.01 eth in your wallet at all times.
NOT the smart contract that you send eth to to make trades.
the original wallet.
One Tutorial told me to put gas price at 21 .
It won't even reach 3500 and will drop to 2200 again
Use at most 0.51.
Anything more than that is a waste since the hardfork.
So Only raise the gas price in high trading times to speed everything up?
Still don't really know what it's really used for.
Gas = measure for computational effortGas limit = maximum amount of gas that your tx is allowed to useTransaction fee = Gas used * Gas price
