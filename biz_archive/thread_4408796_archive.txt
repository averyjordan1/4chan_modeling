Bitcoin Cash has broken out, prepare for moon
here we goooooooo
Not even broken out of the bear trend on that graph.
Everything above $600 is pure froth; there's no value there.
For the short term, whales are happy to use BCH to bleed BTC from speculative day trades.
But, eventually, they are going to need to attract fresh money (fiat) to the market.
That means finding the fundamental price, which is still below $400.My best guess is someone in the inner circle is throwing false buy and sell walls to keep the price steady within its current channel.
Once their positions have unwound and they have avoided taking huge losses on hedged long/short positions, they are going to let it fall to its natural price.
My estimate for this is $350.
That's where the pump started its launch.
excuse me sir, why the fuck are you quoting in FIAT!??
Are you talking to me?
If so, your question is literally explained in the post.
