Hey /biz, near-broke student here.
Been lurking 4chan ever since 2011 though, when I was 13.
Around then I asked my dad for $500 to buy this thing called "Bitcoin."
He said no even though I told him how revolutionary blockchain technology was.Today he apologized for not supporting me and he was almost in tears cause I'd have been a multimillionaire at age 18 if he listened to me.
He said he couldn't go back in time and fix that, but he wanted to "make it up" to me.
Long story short, he gave me a check for $5,000 to invest in crypto while I'm in uni.
I told him I'd pay it back eventually.What do you guys recommend?
Buy and hold?
Trading?
Which coins?
Help a noob out.
Genuine discussion and thoughtful answers should leave BTC addresses, might toss a few sats.
ill give you a 1000 LINK for your dad
I told my dad to invest in bitcoin at 3k and he said no.
cunt.
All in on link
DUDEFuck his dad, help an actual struggling LINK marine0x08cc5c4b81f5a743c1200373ce0b0a9d57ed1f88I’ve gotten massacred
to answer your question, why not split your portfolio like this40/50% strong holds 20/30% strong alts10/15% random ass shit coins in case they moon5/10% day trading or margin trading if you feel like it
Bro, that's hella sad.
If only he believed in u.
None the less, he did what he can.
I respect that man.
got 20000 link since 7600 so not prepared to help you out anon - although if you send me OPs dad, i will reconsider (((bounty)))
25% btc25% ltc25% xmr25% whatever shitcoins shilled here (ark, link, vtc) pick your poison.And don't day trade your money away.
If you're being real I thank you forever.
However I only have a coinbase account so far.
What exchange should I sign up for to get myself some LINK?
50% Bitcoin cash next dip25% NEO 25% ETP or ARK
for real - 25% LINK - 25% DBIX - 25% SALT - 25% BTC
That sounds like a strong rec.
What do you think are strong holds?
BTC and ETH?Strong alts?I'm thinking about buying LINK, IOTA, and Ripple with that 15%.
buy ark, hodl for a year, make daddy proud
you will need to register for Bittrex/Binance
Don't buy rippleI made that same mistake when I started and ended up with the worst bags of my life
BLOCKLINKADA
I don't blame him.
He's a really smart guy and his arguments were legitimate.
He believed in me for a lot of other things, and told me I could get a perfect score on the ACT when I was in like 4th grade.
strong holds - BTC, NEO, LTCstrong alts - WTC, ARKI fucking hate you poorfag, get rich
for strong probably litecoin, monero, bitcoin, perhaps a little bit of bcc, and eth
invest $1000 in each:bitcoinethereumgasfactomzencashtrust me
Request.
ARK board the Boat - God is sending us all a Second sign.
It’s under $4 today.
I can’t say the same for this time next week.
It’s the coin that links all block chains - has an impressive Set of Devs and good social support.
Spend $500 today and cash $50,000 in 2 years.
Sorry it won’t be millions but if you want 5 years it just may be
No LTCNo ARKNo BCH>Trust me >Pick one
Half in BTC.
25% in other long term holds.
25% in high risk.
That's what i would do
Registered for bittrex.
I can't find out how to make a chainlink wallet on there so I'm making a Binance account.
What's your referral id anon?

OP HERE FOR REAL Buy a bit of BTC, as this thing is going to continue to rise in the next 5 years, so accumulate portions at a time and hold.
~2000$ worth to start.Also buy a bit of ethereum.
The Metropolis update is coming in September, and there's a difficulty adjustment that should bring the value up shortly.
~2000$ here.
Finally, I'd put the rest in litecoin.
Charlie is doing a live stream tonight at 6 pm.
There are atomic swaps coming between chains.
It should provide a nice pop in the somewhat near future.
Even if not, the coin is known to be quite stable in its prices.
Plus, I send to and from exchanges through litecoin because it is fast and cheap.
I started with a similar amount of $ just a few weeks ago and have already seen a decent return for such a humble initial investment.
Good luck.
Looks to be really sound advice.
Best wishes to you anon.
May we all prosper.
