I want to start fucking around on the alt coins market and make lots of money so I don't need to waste my life working.
Do I just need to sign up with one exchange, and then do everything from there?
I see a lot of screenshots from the Blockfolio app, how does that have access to your portfolio?
Just buy BTC and hodl like all the normies do
yes you will be rich very soon
Pick any exchange and buy btc for 20-30% gainz or IOTA for moon mission.
So take my bitcoins and put them in IOTA for maximum money?
that's what I'm doing
check A bunch of shit is about to go down.
dont trust biz for your initial investment, you'll get burned and lose money, it'll be a learning experience.
if anything just use 10% of your portfolio to play around and learn ALTS while keeping the other 90% in BTC desu
4399380So which exchange do I sign up to?
Does it matter where I'm based?
coinbase to buy BTC, make exchange accounts on Bittrex/Binance and send BTC from coinbase to those exchange wallets to trade
alternatively buy LTC for cheaper fees
Blockfolio is just an app to keep track of you coins
Sign up to poloniex and transfer your btc over,thats it.Only trade with a small amount though as you will almost certainly lose it all.
Why would I lose it all?
Looking at the history for all the notable coins, they've all appreciated in value over time, unless I'm missing something?
