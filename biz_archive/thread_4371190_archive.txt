Anyone know if syscoin masternodes are due out tomorrow?
They are supposed to be... haven't heard anything certain though.
I bought 1k yesterday though just in case.
No one's talking about it here... can't wait for the FOMO to kick in, should be some nice gains
It's going parabolic.
$6 per coin by January 1.
pajeet pls
This is pretty unlikely, $1 totally possible though, probably not more than $2
