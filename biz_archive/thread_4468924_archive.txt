The only real answer is WTC or Aeron on Binance.WTC has seen no gains all week, and they just announced new government contracts, demonstrated their product with Boxmining, and will release their blockchain along with staking next month.Aeron is currently below ICO price (ICO was 50 cents, currently at 40), smallest marker cap on Binance (~5 million) and will be having a conference with Binance, WTC, and other Chinese companies on Nov 25th.If you don’t buy these now, I don’t know what to tell you.
It’s obvious as fuck.
