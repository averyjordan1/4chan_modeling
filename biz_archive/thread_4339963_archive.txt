can you explain to me what is pic related?I've read everything i know aobut tech i mean why it have every day a ridicolously high volume but it stuck at 1$?
it does like 1,0006 ---> 1,0008 ---> 1,0006
It's pegged to the dollar man.
As more people buy it they need to increase the volume in order to correct the price.
There were some threads where people said that Tethers aren't backed by actual USD.Is that true?
Can someone explain this coin in detail please?
Its backed by belief of being tied to dollar.
Thats why no one wants to buy it for over dollar or no one even tries to sell it for over dollar.Its genius.
Bitfinex made hundreads of millions out of this
Its not backed, but it does the trick for now.
Tether.to claimed that each tether is backed up by 1 USDhowever, to withdraw through the official platform is subject to min 20$ fee and identity checks
There were some threads where people said that Tethers aren't backed by actual USDCorrect.
It says in the terms and conditions that they have no obligation to redeem USDT for USD.
They are just another token backed by nothing.
???
Read the TOS
It's a scam and it's driving up Bitcoin's price for quite some time already
4341134SHUT IT DOWN.
THE GOYIM KNOW
theres a difference between them saying it's Backed and it being redeemable, idiots
more like 100% BLACKEDamirite?
They still haven't shown proof of actually having the 1-to-1 ratio dollar reserves, their ToS says they can't be forced to redeem tethers, the tethers have been used by the same party that issued them to go long and short for millions...
Coincidentally, each major BTC pump in 2017 was preceded by the issuance of millions of new tethers...Nothing to see here guys!
The burden of proof rests with the tinfoilers!
these greedy motherfuckers are going to bring us regulationi hope they all suffer and are never happy with all the money in the world
I'm not saying you're a tinfoil, but rather I have not seen any evidence posted that tether is up to something
