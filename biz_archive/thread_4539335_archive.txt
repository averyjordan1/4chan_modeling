INXT
no whitepaper
Stop spamming this pajeet shitcoin.
No one wants your heavy bags.
Saged.
This project is GIMPED by its supply.
It is not sustainable to have a token with less than 1mil in supply to be used as a currency.
This introduces WAY too much volatility for the average consumer, making the coin completely unreliable.There's also huge competition... Filecoin, Storj, Sia, Feenix... why should someone use Internxt instead of any of those?
Then comes the fact that file storage was supposedly only one of the main factors of INXT, it was trying to compete with Substratum and Shift at first, and then out of nowhere changed to only be a file storage solution.Worst of all is the team.
There's is literally not a single person with credibility or an amazing portfolio.
This is the biggest drawback for me.
Team is completely green, full of literal kids with no credentials who are biting more than they can chew.+Nice idea-Big competition-EXTREMELY limited supply-Team greener than good ganjaWould be good for day trading if it had more volume I guess.
