$1 soon
You mean *back* to a dollar.
IOTA's reputation is permanently stained
and why's that?
New exchanges (bittrex, that hong kong one etc), UCL Wallet, IOTA Foundation established, big partnerships, 10% of news for 2017 announced...IOTA at least $2 by end of year
Did the IOTA founder say he ok w/ pedophila?
Nevermind that was Ethereum founder
when will the ucl street shitter release the new wallet?
have you a date for the bittrex listing?
fuck this coinbought@1.08 and sold @0.49
you should be upset with your stepdad, not IOTA.
UCL Wallet 11/22 and Bittrex announcement by 11/31.
these are firm dates?
Seems perfect honestly>quantum proof>no tx fee>muh dangle>can add floating point if needed>wallet super easy to useIn short it's actually useable as a currency.
I think it's going to be big.
the absolute state of biz........
buy high sell lowliterally all you had to do was be patient, lol
