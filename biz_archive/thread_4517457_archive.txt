Guys.There is day trading and swing trading.But if you want the huge money, you must invest long in the right projects.
Monero or ETH or NEO this year.. or OMG..
The next monster is POWR.Why?Ask yourself what is bigger than money.
Networks.How many poor people are there in the world who don’t have fucking decent power options and are going to get alternative energy before fucking AMERICA?Largest network - Biggest return.POWR is GODCOIN fools.
Bags feeling a little heavy?
It's funny how the list of BIG PROJECTS that you have to invest in for the upcoming years has some established coins with actual potential, and then tossed in there is [SHITCOIN OF THE WEEK].
Buying all the way.You can only beat yourself with this one.I’ve seen ‘em all.
No, I was pointing out if you invested and HELD those projects you retired.POWR is next in the Pantheon.
Instead of FUD hoping for drop, just buy and hold.I am letting 50% of my massive gains ride on POWR all the way.
6 months away from $25.

ETC has a market cap of 1.75 BPOWR is incredibly undervalued.
