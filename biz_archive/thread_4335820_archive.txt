Been browsing trying to figure what Korea's after next, pretty sure I got it as its beginningIt looks like it'll be ripple next.Don't miss this run guys
I dropped most of my XRP bags already but still have about 3k left, so I hope this is true, but honestly it takes an act of God to move this stupid coin more than 0.01 so I'm not holding my breath
It could easily go 3x with all that bch money the koreans just made, if not moreI mean dash went up $200, and you gotta figure if they aren't operating on cryptopia or bittrex they're targeting top 10s Xrp, ltc, xmr gotta be next
Dash has a supply of 7 million coins, XRP is over 38 billion.
It takes a Hell of a lot more to make a dent in ripple.
But who knows, maybe they can budge it enough to start a fomo rise.
I'll put in some sell orders before taking a nap just in case
True takes alot more but they went up a few billion on the marketcap for BCH, a few billion on xrp can be some pretty sick gains
xrp will be $223 in feb next year screencap this digits confirm
I'd be set for life if that happened.
And while I have high hopes for XRP, I do not think $100+ is realistic at all.
congrats, just screencap the post you'll see
how much will it take the marketcap anyawys.
This is the single most unreasonable thing I've seen posted in my four years of browsing this /btc/ board.
no he meant 23$ also trips why why why anon
xrp will be $223
I have been watching OKcash recently.
put 113k the sats last week, it doubled, as expected.
if you look at the yearly chart, that shit is ready for a large pump.
supply doesn't matter
I know but what happens next year will be unimaginable
.6 trillion
Is it?
