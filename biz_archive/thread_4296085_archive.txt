FA and TA is looking good, what will be the catalyst for a breakout in ETP?
>buy my bags
ive got a whale friend.
he said buy it up
what is the estimated profit on this motherfucker in 1-2years?
100 ETP is all it takes to make it.
Zero
fuck what should i do with the other 9900?
For alts to settle again.Right now people are fomoing and selling alts to go into BCH/pull out completely.
When BCH settles, alts will start increasing again, and ETP will blow up.
There might be currently better short term investment s, but in the long run the current price is absolutely laughable.

Stop insistently shilling this coin... you make it sound like a shitcoin.
It is honestly one of the best coins out there it doesn't need to be mindlessly shilled.
Everyone who sees this is already balls deep into this coin and will see 5x gains in the next few months
Yeah their wallet is a huge issue.
I bought a shitload of ETP.
Just waiting for it to moon so I can flee from my prestigious position as a certified wagecuck
Thanks.
I'm going to buy more ETP when people hopefully panic sell from this
I have 52.5, will I make it?
At least 100x.
In two years 10b MC is nothing
They have light wallet in development, should calm holders for a bit once released.
In testing since 9th Nov.
