You all sit here thinking your going to "Make it" by just buying one more crypto or just buying one more stock or by investing a little bit more.
But the truth is.
You're behind.
You haven't even started your engine yet.
You haven't been through the first challenge.
And it's sad because you continually fall for these obvious pump and dump shills.
And it's even more sad that instead of starting your monetary journey you sit he laughing at memes and worst yet...
Following them.
It's true.
Crypto currency's are a real bull market.
But let me tell you a secret.
In the end.
You either made it, Or you didn't.
And that lamborghini you bought: Lamborghini had been making more money than you will ever while you waited that one coin to go up

You should be building a shuttle and getting a crew together to make yourselves go to the moon, instead of loading up into someone elses cargo hold and hoping the shuttle doesnt explode during takeoff.

Then after failing get even madder.

What an annoying faggot.
Just because you're a fucking retard that doesn't know how to invest doesn't mean other people are too.
Your anger is the first step.
Good.
