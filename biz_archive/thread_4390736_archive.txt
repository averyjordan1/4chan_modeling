Hold on.
BTC reached new high, so alts have to bleed a little.Whne BTC is done money will go back to the alts that were doign well (Lisk, FCT, etc.)
BTC breaks 7300 not even 1h after I sold it for alts (including factom)>total BTC value of my alts already down over 2%kill me
Yeh, sucks.
I just bought a lot more FCT as well.Fuck this, I'm going to bed.
Think FCT will shoot back up once BTC stabilizes at 8000 or whatver the fuck.
Yeah
implyingBTC has been straight up and you're losing BTC if you hold alts.
Don't bet against BTC.
I learned this the hard way all through September.
I would have a lot more money if I just held BTC.
What exactly do you think is going to stop BTC from continuing to new ATHs at this point?
4391051Yeah, I learned sma lesson.Sucks though because if BTC stops at 7400, then may as well just hold.
If it goes to 8000, definitely worth selling alts.
rebounded to 280 pretty quick...
