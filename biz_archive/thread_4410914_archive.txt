I sold 10btc before the first fork.I just now bought 3.5.I will not wait for a crash, or a dip since I won't buy it again, like the last 3 I've missed.
I simply don't care anymore, the stress is to great.I'll wagiekek every hour I can, and all this money will be used to buy the king.
I have learned my lesson.
The one thing I will never do again, is sell the king.All bitcoin apps have now been deleted from my phone/pc, now is the time for reflection and inner peace.Anyone else in the same situation?
ya brah im all in on BTCno more scamcoins for me
Dump that ponzi shit you idiot, buy BCH.
Why did you sell BEFORE a fork, OP?
Did you not know about it?
Or not understand airdrops or what?
I don√§t see why you'd take your money off the table just before it all got doubled in token terms..?KEK
