How do I find cheap isolated land in europe or the UK?There are only 20 listings for farm land in scotland under 10k and mostly its just 1 acre for 5-10k GBP
check out Eastern Europe
Just go to a place that has no one and build your own house.
Are you a gypsie?
But it depends on the country.
If you google buy ground in their respective language you will probably see plenty of things on Google.
Someone owns that land.
They will have you removed, along with your new house.
no one owns anything in reality, if you've got power you can take over the world and say its yours

Land and property is cheap as fuck in places like Bulgaria but you'd have shit tier services.
For most farm land in Scotland you'd have to check local listings - I'm assuming you just checked using the likes of Zoopla or Rightmove.
Where I live is traditionally agricultural and smallholdings and there's plenty of 1-5 hectare plots available for between £10-50k.
