Just bought a few litecoin, simply because I am a poorfag and it feels good to own MULTIPLE FULL COINS (fuck you bitcoin)What's the future of this coin?
Can we assume .01 to 1 with a bit of lag forever, or what?Also, bought 1.1 ETH, opinions?
Am I good or did I megafuck myself?
Well in 10 years when your LTC is worth $3,000 a coin my 0.07 BTC will be worth $250,000
It just feels like the potential gains of bitoin really wont make a difference with my povertyfag budget.
yeee yee should buy @ 73.
Im afraid daddy
.07?
Damn dawg, I'm making that in a week off masternodes
