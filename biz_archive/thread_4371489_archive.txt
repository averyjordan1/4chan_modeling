>he's not buying the new BTC at 17$I told you about this 2 days ago at 10$, anon.
Its hitting HitBTC and should be parity in price with shittier GPU mined BTC clones like BTG.But go ahead, gargle on Charlie Lee balls with promise of LTC moon, even it goes to 80$ that's pathetic ROI lmao.Compared to BTX which will go from 17 to 20 to 100 once people realize I'll have enough to be airdropped about 5 a week, and if they cost 20 or 200$ either way it's going to be /comfy/Get in retard.
Is this new bitcoin core purple edition v2?
