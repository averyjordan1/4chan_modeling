Fuck I love it I can't wait for the Pink Wojack Threads.

This desu.Also this coin moons on shitty exchanges.
Imagine what will happen when we hit binance and bittrex.

Kek you think HST is another pump and dump pajeetcoin, anon?
Are you medically stupid?Read the white paper and look at the quality team:Website: horizonstate.comTelegram: t.me/horizonstate
EVERYONE!DOES ETHERDELTA HAVE DEPOSIT MINIMUMS?
I WANNA MESS AROUND BUT NOT WITH TOO MUCH SO I WANNA KNOW WHAT THE DEPOSIT MINIMUM IS
no
Etherdelta is a decentralized exchange.
It's different than, say, binance or bittrex.If you're not familiar with ED, I'd suggest you to buy HST on kucoin or livecoin.Many people lost money on ED because they are not yet familiar with it.
4497168thank you
What specifically is the news desu?
Anytime, anon.
Go to this thread, anon 
THESE BAGS ARE SO FUCKIN HEAVY MAN
Fuck.
I put up a high bid, why is no one selling?
Because they are expecting a bigger gain, anon.
So no one is going to sell cheap.If you put up a high bid, just wait.
Someone will eventually fill your buy order.
No worries though, ill be patient.
Etherdelta seems to be one of the more straightforward and no-fuss exchanges around currently.
It's breathtaking how easy it was to get started.
Fuck etherdelta books are so fucking slow jesus fucking christ fuck
Use KuCoin
