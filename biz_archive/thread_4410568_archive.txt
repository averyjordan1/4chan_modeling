What exchange do I use when I don't want to pay capital gains while day trading my buttcoins?I remember BT-Ce required fuck all verification back in the day but it's gone now.
Nearly all sites make u have verification so u could just withdrawal from some shit like bittrex into a bitcoin address then use localbitcoin to get your money back into ur account slowly
Only way is using tethers and fuck that.
Maybe bitmex with a VPN but you'll have to go back to btc to withdraw
