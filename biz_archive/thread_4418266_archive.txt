Now I am a poor pajeet
How can you guys not distinguish the average shitcoins from actual dogshit pajeet tier shitcoins?Literally all you gotta do is open their website and whitepaper and look at it for a bit.
Dont even have to read it fully or go into a deep research, looking at it for 5 minutes is enough
You forgot the part where you sell or bought too high...
Lmao I saw this logo a few days ago and thought to myself "who the fuck would actually buy something like this?
There's more crypto currencies now than actual currencies, and this is one?
What the fuck?"
man op you deserve it, just look at the logo.
It's called fuckin up firing?
How is this a currency?
