i'm surprised this isn't dumping.
Any news?
listen , this one is not for you, it's a great long term investment so it won't make you rich overnight .posw has veen fudded til they fuckers get bored and it will make a comeback in 2018 , this is solid and it's not vaporware so it will take time to accomplish what they want to deliver.conclusion, stay out of it FUCKING MOONBOYS.
it's hardly dumping is itthe trading volumes are so thin that any buy or sell order can cause the price to change significantly
i've been holding it since i first heard about it
All I know is that it is the chosen wallet of Kek.
Astrology tells me it will moon in 2020.
Why the fuck is it dipping?
It's starting to piss me off now desu.
