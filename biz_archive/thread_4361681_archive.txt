there's something big on the way for REQ.
mid-december to early january.
it's an announcement that's been rumored here and there but appears to be true.
can't say more than this; do what you want with this advice.
if you're already holding absolutely do not sell before this announcement which will be latest very beginning january.
I'm gonna make it if it hits $1.
Lamboland at $10.
