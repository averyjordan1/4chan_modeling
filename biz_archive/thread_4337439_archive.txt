sold by bitcoins at 6k expecting drop to sub 5k and rebuy there.
And yesterday was Sunday and banks here don't work at weekends so couldn't buy untill now.AND BTC US FUCKIG 6.4K
Well, swings of 1500$ in one day seem to be fucking normal these days.
btc is going to 4ku did good selling at 6k
No way, it's going to go up to 6800 again.
There is simply no reason for it to drop.
simply no reason for it to drop.If only you knew how bad things really areenjoy the next 6 months
talking stuff but not really refuting the argumentYou have no idea how hard your life is gonna be
I put a short at 6'400 3 days ago.Every time it goes back there, it's fucking killing me.I still can't tell which is stronger, the resistance at 6'400 or the bottom at around 5'700.If it goes back down once again and recover I'll just buy back my fucking btc and alts.
of course now the wall at 6400 just got bought, I had 3 fucking days to take profit and now I'm at loss againkill me pleaseI did around 200 trades in the last 4 years and only 2 were positive, I shit you not
Why are you this retarded?
What?
How?
You literally had a bunch of chances you greedy motherfucker.This was supposed to be supportive post but i dont even
because I was sure we'd go to at least 5k.
There are so many fundamentals that should put btc down for a while, the TA is agreeing but it looks like the money keep flowing anyway.
there is a saying in my home country.better to have a sparrow in your hand than a eagle in the winds.
