>not buying the dip
so basically free tokens if they drop to 0
It's not a dip if it doesnt come back
just bought 100k
wait for at least 2 weeks.
they too busy with the legal case so they wont give news.
no news + bad rep =  cent CFD.
i will buy a shitton of it and hold for 2 years
Just you wait until it hits
Is there any coin that didn't immediately crash upon hitting Binance?
WTC, LINK, NULS others I can't remember.
4456834BAT already had crashed.
MOD
can someone explain why it crashed without just saying its a shitcoin/scam/etc
A "lawyer" gave the devs "bad advice" and they are in "legal trouble".
Eternal dip
fuck it, I just put some lunch money into buy orders at 500 sats.
Could be easy money if it picks up again, or else not much is lost.
team obviously held tokens posing as buyers , dumped well before the news hit .
Gg noobs, this happens when you say you'll use that shitcoin chainlink
I warned you guys not to trust beady-eyed chads.
