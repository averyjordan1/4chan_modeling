So is it safe to call this a certified shitcoin at this point?
No, it's a strong coin with many use cases.
Even if you aren't sold on SWIFT's long-term implementation, at least look at the promising projects that will be using LINK very soon, like Confido which is going to use ChainLink to input shipping data into their smart contracts.
Aren't you a little out of the loop my friend ?

Don't you want to put data INTO the blockchain?
