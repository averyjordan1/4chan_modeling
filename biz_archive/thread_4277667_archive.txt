Thank you OP, I completely agree.
After some guy on reddit shilled it several months ago and I saw it in a continual decline for months I knew to disregard anything that idiot ever said again.Pretty much any coin that says they solve a governance or voting problem is trash.
You don't need a coin for that.
It will just be integrated into another coin if it actually solves a problem.
fucking weak hands.
I've been holding a couple of shitcoins since fucking June and I'm not planning to sell at a loss.
Not in the bulliest market in history.
Req is going to use it.
District0x is going to use it.
Any organization in the future that uses their AragonOS is going to use it.
It was always a longhodl.
You exited a few months before it would be useful.
You can probably enter again before REQ comes out, but it would probably be better to just by REQ then, so.... (but REQ is mooning RIGHT NOW, so...)
This coin has solid tech like BAT.
If you sold it at a loss, you're an idiot.
It hit rock bottom and will only go up from here on out.
I have been holding this since July.
Lpok at the daily chart for fuck's sake OP.
Lol, not knowing what aragon is.
