Sold all my pre-sale POWR to invest in some companies that were presenting at Devcon (SNT, RLC).
Then it mooned.AMA
have you bought back in yet?
Nah, I have a personal rule to not buy into coins once they've already mooned.
It's up 10x from ICO price, I'm an idiot for selling, but smart enough to not chase that pump
How do you plan to kill yourself?
Sold POWR with loss, to get in to POT.
Lost almost everything.
Eh it hurts, could've turned 8 ETH into 80.At the end of the day it's a small % of my stack though, but would have been a nice little bump to the portfolio
lol, that is not even 10 bugs worth.
It was like 32k POWR at a pre-sale price of 0.00025, so 8 ETH worth
Did the same, I was holding 115k.
Sold it all.
It hurts, I know.
i sold too early.
i bought a fat stack at 6500 and sold at 8400 when it was meeting resistance.
oh well.
i guess sometimes we need to be content with paltry gains
how do you guys get into ICO's like that?
The only ICO I got into was LINK and that's thanks to /biz/ shilling
Sold Monacoin yesterday because I thought it stabilized>Go to sleep>See the new valueOk
