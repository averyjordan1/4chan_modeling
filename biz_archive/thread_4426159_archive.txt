Mmm are you sure?
ethereumonly ethereum.Read tether eula and you'll understand why if a lot of people wanted to sell their tethers at once, the exchanges wouldn't buy them back at 1 dollar to ensure the 1 dollar price.
Tethers is an elaborate ruse that isn't even backed by an "I owe you" pledge.It also runs on a layer on the BTC blockchain, that might experience chain death after its next difficulty adjustment.I'd rather have bitshares BitUSD than tether desu, and I don't want either.
yes of course
MOD doesn't drop too much unlike other coins.
No.
Is there any pumpworthhy news regarding Bancor?Idk, eth loves to drop to high 290 a lot.
Which is understandable I guess.Oh no, I never buy tether lol, it was just an example.
