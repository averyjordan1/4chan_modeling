Muh Tether scam.Do you cucks even understand fractional-reserve banking?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional-reserve_bankingThe whole financial system is a fucking ponzi scheme, just shut up and profit from it.
Honestly I'm just excited for the tone vays, flibbr, bitfinexed and hopefully Phil Potter debateThat would be amazing.
Could be good.
But ultimately if it falls down what happens?It is under 1 billion dollars...
Except banks are regulated and has tons of checks and balances.What does tether have?
crypto is still growing against gold adjusted for paper gold we're good herecan't say as much for anything else
Yeah right, that's why in the EU they are pushing to no longer insure bank deposits.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-14/eu-eyes-capping-deposit-withdrawals-when-banks-are-found-failingThe whole system is a fucking shell game.
thats like asking what will you do once fiat collapses.
If anything the only good thing this tether thing is doing is opening a few more eyes open to the fiat international central banking scam.
What are you arguing exactly?
That regulation is unnecessary for the financial system and no fraud will happen?
U high?
This is why people got into crypto, to get away from the jewery of banks.
Fractional reserve banking in crypto is so much worse because you dont have a central bank and some kike called berkanke backing it
Not saying tether is a scam, but it's definitely risky.
There's a reason banks are heavily regulated and even then you can never eliminate the risk of a bank run completely.
If a tether bank run starts (everyone decides they want to convert their tether to fiat) what then?
