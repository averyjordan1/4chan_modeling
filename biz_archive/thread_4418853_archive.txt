I got JUSTed by pajeet state
I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA GET ADDED ON A BIG EXCHANGE LIKE BITTREX OR BINANCE.
WHY ARE THEY GETTING ADDED TO NIGGER EXCHANGES FUCKKKKK ARENT THEY TALKING TO GOVERNMENTS AND HAVE A WORKING LEGIT PRODUCT?
THIS SHIT WILL NEVER MOON AND IM GONNA GET STUCO BAGHOLDING AS USUAL
It's actually a good sign - it means they're not wasting all their fucking money paying the scammers at Bittrex and Binance.It costs way too much to get listed there, and I'd rather they spend the money I contributed during ICO on things like product development.
Kucoin meh>Cryptopiameh >Livecoinmehwake me up when its get added on bittrex or binance
Can we get a referral chain for Kucoin going?Mine's E4pA07
they hyped up news about exchanges, and this is what they're getting listed on?horizon: stagnant
$1 EOY is very likely.Nigger, it costs so much to get listed on big exchanges.
Binance for example asks for $100k.I prefer they start slowly on medium exchanges to grow strong support and community and then go for the big exchanges later.
That way, HST won't get dumped hard like GVT.So you'd rather buy HST later at $2 after they got listed on binance than buy now at $0.25 when they are still under the radar?
Ok coolThey never hype up the exchange announcement.
They clearly stated in the beginning, that binance/bittrex won't be an option for now.
