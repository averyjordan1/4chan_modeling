This shit is on ED even though it's not listed.
https://etherdelta.com/#0xea097a2b1db00627b2fa17460ad260c016016977-ETHIt's an incentivized file-sharing coin with a massive token burn on the 19th.
You all saw what happened with TRIG.
Get in this shit before it's formally listed, ED moons aren't to be fucked with.
The cap is going to be under $300k after the burn, from what I've read.

ED coins are the fucking EASIEST pumps dude normies don't know shit about buying cheap on it
looks promising
No public team, no chat channels, why would I buy this?
I mean, I'm not holding this for too long.
But UFR getting hyped up and shilled is basically inevitable considering it hasn't been listed yet.
Haven't you seen an ED shitcoin moon before?
The depth looks good on it af
this is 10x ico, do not touch
I don't see how that has any bearing on the current price.
It's still pretty underground.
no github>anon creators>just a erc tokenx ico pricesure, buy bags at 10x price.
your upside is 2x and your risk is probably 5x
What the ICO price on this chitcoin?
The current going price is now ~24 cents, making the market cap around $6 million at the moment since the going price is about .00085 eth.
In other words, nothing to see here, folks.
This is high for you?
Considering how much it has grown just in the past day or two, yes.
There are literally logs of .0001 trades right now.
Anyone buying this shit right now is a dummy, wait for a correction at least, ya'll are getting dumped on otherwise
