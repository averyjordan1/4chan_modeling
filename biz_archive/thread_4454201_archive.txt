I bought 30k of this (all in) at $48.
Will I be ok?
I am due to pay 25k tax next month, and now I dont have enough, I cant stop looking at the chart and panicking...Will it go up or should i just end it now?
I am tired of losing all the time...

Bought at 48 sold at 39.
Only regret was not holding BTC.
Anons weren't joking, alts should be to accumulate BTC.
Fuck all their moon mission bullshit, for every smug chinese cartoon there are 10 pink wojaks.
HODL your coins and don't fucking panic sell for shit - a future version of yourself is watching...
DONT buy any of this Chinese shit, are you a complete fucking idiot ??
kys its going back to $25
I guess around 30$ - 35$ with a dip to 25$
You're gonna be fine.
BUY BUY BUY
