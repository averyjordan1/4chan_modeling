Hi guys, how does my future look?
I'm holding BAT, LTC, NXT, POWR and ETH.
Not looking to swing trade just gain value.

Half those coins dont even have a fiat pair.
You think they will beat bitcoins gain speed?
I'll trade LTC or ETH for it?
I'm not looking to be rich just wanted to turn a few hundred dollars into a few thousand in a couple of years.
