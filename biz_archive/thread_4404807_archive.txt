Kidscoin by far.People pumped that shit 20K based on some rumor that new Zealand was creating a crypto for kids to try out, but it was 100% a lie based on a charity program that had the same name that just happened to come out right when it was listed on yobit.Shit was golden, i got my first 8x on that.
This was amazing, i was refreshing that thread a day
there was a whole period of yobit pumps
