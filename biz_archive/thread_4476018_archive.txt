I was going to buy before the 'fork', /biz/ said waitI was going to buy @ ~$6500, /biz/ said waitNow its at $8500.
If it gets to $10k, I don't think it'll ever dip below that.So what do boyos?
I wanted to buy BTC initially just to screw around with other cryptos but now it seems like BTC is a really good long term hold bet.
Even normies are buying BTC.
It dipped down to like 5,700 or so a week ago maybe.
That was the buy in point.
Is it reasonable to expect another dip?
What's a good buy order price?
BTC PUMP THREAD JUST STARTED.
