How is it working out for you?
I'm genuinely curious if this is a viable long-term trading strategy.
it's called daytrading
Absolutely not.
You sound like a fucking woman.
You dont have more than 1000usd in cryptos do you?
No.
Thats retarded.
I fell for the FOMO once, lost some money and I learned my lesson.
I don't panic sell, it'd fuck up my tax position for no good reason.
I panic buy anything that as an EMA Spread of 5% on the 4 hour candles and panic sell when it's over 5% with my whole stack.this seems to be working 70% of the time.
The only thing I'm guilty of is FOMO buying BTC, and it worked out so far.
I don't touch anything else except myself.
In the beginning - yes.
lost a lot - went all in on VTC when it was rising and made all my initial back.
Cashed out, cashed back in - have been holding same 4 coins for a month now.
Im up 12% ...
