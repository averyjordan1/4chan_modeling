if I sell when others are buying and buy when others are selling, I make money, correct?and if everyone is buying the rumor and selling the news then I just do the opposite and make more money?
sell the rumor buy the news?
well if you buy when people are selling their bags (because something's crashing) no you don't make money, only if it will go back up again.
And no if you sell the rumor it means you're selling cheap, then the price goes up higher and higher as the "news" is expected to be delivered, and the news is almost always disappointing, so the price drops at that point.If there's a rumor that say such-and-such company is going to form a partnership with another big corporation and it will be officially announced on December 21st, you want to start buying up now, and then on like December 18-20th you'd want to sell everything.
