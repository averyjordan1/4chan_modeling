Is it happening Anon?
Fake walls to scare everyone off are fake?
the 2h chart may get turned but it will take sustainable buys to move the 4H.
I'm hoping for the "special announcement" today to aid this
Donâ€™t trade this shitcoin.Lost money last night because this shit keeps going between 0.7-0.8.Its 0.8 now so you will lose money.
Whale has been gradually adding to the walls so they match and then start looking bigger than the buy walls so whenever the depth chart is seen people get demoralized.I think he wants to avoid detection by doing it gradually and in response to the increasing buy walls so it ends up looking organic but I've been watching it and this thing is definitely too conscious to be organic.Another mark was yesterday, during the Bitcoin uptrend the sell walls became laughably thin, then once Bitcoin cooled down the big sell walls came back out of nowhere.
