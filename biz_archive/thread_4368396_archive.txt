Is there anyway to increase the automatic refresh rate of the charts on Bittrex?
They seem to refresh maybe once a minute.
I want to know the real price of fast moving stocks and have to watch the orderbook, but I prefer watching the chart.
Are there better charts I can use?
Try tradeviewsuperior charts for people who like good charts
sorry, *tradingview
I've never found a way to make it move faster.
It also lags 5 minutes behind the order books which makes it about as useful as a marzipan dildo for actually making trades with.
tradingview looks awesome.
Great interactive chart.
Thanks a lot anon
That's a stupid pic op.
