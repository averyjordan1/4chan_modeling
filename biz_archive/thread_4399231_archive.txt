Serious talk.
Don't you guys ever get tired of the constant shilling, P&D's, and just general scumbag bullshit that always goes on here?I really wish there was a place you could talk about different cryptos and opportunities without the constant bullshit.I've been visiting this shit site for a while and I honestly feel like the quality has dropped down massively.
19/20 posts are scams, shills, or memes.
For fuck sake.
Naw it’s pribably same in quality, you’re just more aware of what goes on here now
Yeah.
It's difficult to separate serious and enjoyable comments from shills and trolls.I know we're on 4chan but damn.
I was thinking it could be that.
I've been here for a little over a year now.
I don't recall seeing this many shit threads before.
nowadays is all about bag holders shillling their coins
I guess that may-june run created a lot of bagholders.
Still a lot of the shilling are new coins, I can't imagine you've been bag holding a recent ICO that long.
i'm currently balls deep in pwernot shilling tho, im not really sure where it can go, i'm in just because of the recently rumours around here
All of the BS and shill posts are a great filter out dumb normie money.
The sooner they lose 50% in a day the better
crypto sucks assmoney is cool though and bagholder memes + ass keeps me coming back here
it all changed when people started shilling 3rd gen binance tokens.
Learn to tell what's pnd, what's legit, what's bs, etc.
How do you do that?
Tell me senpai.
