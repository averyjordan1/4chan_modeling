Last night BTC dips below $8k.
Suddenly half of /biz/ is declaring the end times.
SELL NOW OR LOSE EVERYTHING.>momentarily startled>then: ffs, this again>go to sleep>wake up and BTC is at $8200 againDo people actually think every tiny blip is apocalypse-level or are they just trying to FUD, or are they just envious fags that hate bitcoin and jerk off to its possible demise every time it dips 2%?
its fud from cashcucks
thisbtc will never die
This, also just ATH'd a few mins ago
I'm just letting you know the surge is people buying BTC with tether at whatever price they can.
This surge is the smart money going into BTC and out of Tether.BTC will hold up just fine if Tether gets fucker but anyone holding Tether will get deep dicked.
