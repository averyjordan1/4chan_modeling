I have 800€ to invest into crypto for long term invest.
Maybe will rebuy every month.
What coin should I buy?
Salt?
Link?
REQ?
ARK and ETP
why etp?
Why ARK and ETP?
LINKThe only good option.
What’s about REQ?
Would like to diversify the portfolio.
Honest advice SALT is no brainer, you cant loose with it.
It will be over 20$ at some point, not even shilling
SALT is good medium term.
LINK is medium-long term.
REQ is trash and won't survive the popping of the bubble.
SALT won't either most likely.
LINK has most use case, which is most important
Alright, that’s why I thought as well about salt.
Do you have an opinion on REQ?
SALT are money lenders, only way they wont survive is if crypto as whole crashes and at that point it wont matter what are you holding
Im too thinking about buying it, but im not sure yet
