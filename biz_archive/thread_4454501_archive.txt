Guys, I'm worried.Ark is a solid project, the 2017 version of Ethereum, we have great announcements coming before 2018 and our moon is due to begin.However, if the Tether shit hits the fan we'll be looking at a doomsday scenario for crypto.
We're talking about people losing everything and multiple arrests.
It will be Gox for years, perhaps the end of crypto untill the day the federal reserve starts a new project.Can the Ark survive the flood?
We need to sail soon.
The end is near
can't wait until this shit happens
Someone be honest with me, no memesIs Tether really bound to fail?
If so, why?
And even if it did, would that really effect crypto to the point where it kills it?
Me too, but I'm balls deep in Ark.
In case it doesn't take off before the fraud, I'm losing everything
ProbablyDefinitely not
Yes.Backed by nothing, money printing at its finest.Depends on how long it lasts.
If it crashed today, BTC would probably go back to 1~2k, which is absolutely great for the state of the fraud, but if the party goes on, we'll be talking about billions, maybe hundreds of billions.If Tether keeps doing it for another year, it'll be enough to bury BTC for years.
