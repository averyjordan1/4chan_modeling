Pay no attention to the pump chasers.
They will get dumped on in the end in every P&D they participate in.REQ becomes interesting later this year.
A sell off like this only improves your average cost.
But I'm sure selling low and buying into some pump ATH is a great strategy too anon.
that's what you people get when you fall for these high cap scam icos.
not even a proof of concept, still raise like 30 million dollars.
