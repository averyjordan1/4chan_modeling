It's slowly going up because of amex too so you might gain 5%Probably the most stable of all coins out forever.
And when I gets going it will really move.
More azn qt also XLM... and VTC for midterm hold.
If you have $20k laying around buy enough Syscoin to have a masternode.
They're enabling masternodes and PoS soon, price will definitely pump.
Impossible to pump too.
You want security there it is.
