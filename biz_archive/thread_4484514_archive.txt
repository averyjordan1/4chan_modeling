Will ETH ever break past $1,000?
Yes, the US dollar will become so weak compared to crypto that ETH will easily be worth $1,000.
Im talking to weak that we will be using dollar bills as wall paper like germany in the 1930's
By end of January.
no, the inflation will keep it downabout 10% lost to inflation per year
So what?
BTC went up 10x last year, 10% inflation would be a drop in the ocean at such rates
1 bitcoin 1 billion eoy
true.
1 eth 10 billion dollars eoy
Not only 1000 dollars, it will go all the way up to 10 000 dollars.
Wait for 5 years and you will see.
Screenshot this.
yeah but why would you invest in something that automatically degrades/ by 10% each year when you have bitcoin that never degrades or inflates
no but it will break $100
Lads, newfag here.should I get 1ETH and hold just incase BTC fucks up?Does that sound like a good strategy?
