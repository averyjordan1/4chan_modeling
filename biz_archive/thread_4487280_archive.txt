Since bitconnect is being talked that it might go away at any point now, what are other lending services to get some easy ponzi gains like bitconnect?
No idea but that black dude on youtube is gonna make sure we hear about it.
BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT
Where would I research bitconnect going away?
Wage slave here, all my crypto is done between jobs :)

Hextracoin has an almost identical system to bitconnect and it's still pretty young.
Their coin has also been going up like crazy since the ICO ended since people are locking it up in long term contracts.
If you decide to sign up, use my referral link: https://hextracoin.co/register?referrer=NickBit
BTC is gonna disappear overnight
Hextra is probably the next one ill jump onto.
Still looking around though
