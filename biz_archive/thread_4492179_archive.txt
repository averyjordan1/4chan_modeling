Is this Operation Dragonslayer a load of BS?
or is the flippening upon us?
BCH charts are looking good.
But this is crypto.
Nothing makes sense.
BITCOIN CASH IS KING BITCOIN
>He trusted a fucking picture of a whiteboard
Wtf are you guys looking at.
It's hd steady around the 0.144 mark...what's the big deal?
The bitcoin difficulty will adjust, goyim.
look at it this way, BCH has a comfy floor around 1100, so even if nothing happens when corecoin's difficulty adjusts, you won't lose anything
seeIt's over, bitcoin will be locked up after the difficulty adjustment.
This is THE pump and short
BTC is fucked broyou still have time tho
see I would be inclined to believe this, its just ever since it pumped to $2400 and then straight back down, literally every day people have been saying flippening and nothing happens
All those butts are going to be worthless, the dumping has already started.
4492259>The bitcoin difficulty will adjustBy almost nothing
it's high right now, then the miners pull out, retard
The estimated difficulty change in the bottom right is damned near negligible.
The fuck are you talking about?
I never said a thing about hashpower
4492318>can't even tell it's a graph about when the next difficulty adjustment is due, not what the actual difficulty is>bottom right number is how much that estimate has changed, not how much the difficulty is changing by
4492357brainlet corecuck, that estimate changes constantly.
some sites actually have the difficulty adjusting lower.
the estimates don't matter, the fact is that Jihadi Jihan will ensure it will be higher
>this can happen every difficulty change>core thinks it can survive onslaught every ~10 dayshmmm
Its going to be 16000 in january
