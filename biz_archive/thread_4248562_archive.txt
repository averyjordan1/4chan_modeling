By the way you should not 100% follow his advice, it's just a way to get informations.Also keep in mind that ICO about an application or a product will most likely fail, when an ICO about blockchain protocol and dev things are more chance to skyrocket.To summarize, on the web it's Facebook, Google or Amazon that get cashOn the blockchain it's protocol (Http, TCIP, POP...etc) not the app
