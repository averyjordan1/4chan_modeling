I know a lot of /biz/ lost a lot with alts dropping today.
I made alot on astro, and you can still do it.>honest TA, thats a perfect bull pennant, rising volume as well on ED >play this easily, get in, sell at .016xx, thats the next resistance.
obviously not the same chart.>liar
profitssssssssssssssssss
its dumping now....keep holding your bags brah
astro will go way higher than 0.012 wtf it just go ton CMC today.
Also, is there any way to change the damn etheredelta chart?
I can barely see shit on it
can't dump a token with only a few hundred in every puneet's wallets
I'm in alts but I'm pretty much flat for the day, XRP and BTX kept me afloat
why is their website down?
been down for hoursdid they run off with the profits?
it's back up now
use www.
so far looks like OP was right...
ofc i was, I made the orginial astro threading telling all you fags to buy>im making you guys money for no reason....why?!
well, I love you OP cause I caught the dip.
alts dropped today?
almost all my portfolio is in alts and I'm up a bit, must be my relatively high iota stake.
join the fucking group, everyone who has bought will love me.
>im not shilling, im sharing.
