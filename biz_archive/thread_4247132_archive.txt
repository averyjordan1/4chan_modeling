You have 2 days left to exit all of altcoin markets before everything goes down to -80%
I don't care, I've already capitulated.
I literally don't care.
Take me now makifes2.jpg smoking anime poster.
I have no more patience.
Same.
I've already lost more than 80% of my money, I don't give a shit at this point.
>l2cryptobuild an amazing portfolio that when btc goes up my alts go down 10-20%, when btc goes down then my alts would be up 300%and either way my coins worth even more when converted to fiat
Bitcoin is forming a double top
I have 10k ready to throw at alts if they crash and burn, but most likely they won't.
They are literally at crash and burn prices right now.Seriously some coins are at lows they havenâ€™t seen for 5 months and others are sitting just above their ico price.What more do you fucking want ?
Opposite will happen
Fuck you, I just bought 500usd DGB.
this.
after fork money will flow back into alts, now is the time to accumulate them
I REFUSE.
I already lost so much.And when they want to buy back into alts, I'll say - "NO."
Not until it's a price I can profit off of.
this.
Op is fucked in the head
This
my alts are worth more than bitcoins.
give me one reason why i should sell them at a loss... that's right, there's none.
i will hold until i sell them at a 10-100x profit.
fuck you and fuck bitcoins.
i will not be shaken by your weak FUD.
my alts are down a lot in sat value, but i don't care about that.
i know they are more valuable than bitcoin.
price doesn't mean value.
the old will be replaced by the new... it's the cycle of life.
i invest in the newer, faster... better.

Last night I jerked off to some rule 34 porn for the first time in my life.
