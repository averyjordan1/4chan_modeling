No trips :(Anyway, I was hoping REQ would stay low until end of month when I get paid.
Getting tax returns too which I want to invest.
Trips?Also, I really hope REQ to go up before fucking Q4 2018, but with this BTC/BCH fuckery I just don't know
ive been lurking, how can I start and what wallet should I use?
willing to invest a decent amount

Well BTC is going to the stratosphere AGAIN so REQ is going to hell AGAIN.
Fuck this, I really need to delete Blockfolio and stop lurking /biz/ for my own health.
XTO and REQ, they will be make me filthy rich, but not right now.
First, you gotta join an exchange where you can buy btc with dollars.
(Coinbase, Gemini..I use Gemini)Then you sign up for Binance.
Binance, Poloniex, and Bittrex are the exchanges that you can buy the altcoins like REQ.
REQ is only on Binance right now, but as it grows, it'll be available on larger exchanges.Send the Bitcoin you bought to your binancethe exchange serves as your wallet for whatever coins you buy.Then buy your REQ and join the rest of us in hell scratching our fingernails into the charred walls of the damned

hope for a whale to pump it or wait for it to hit a higher volume exchange
much appreciated anon

not really, I mean why?0x0589de712847aeff7cb45b7ba8a3ad0da5ecb492

This has to pump with the Q4 launch
