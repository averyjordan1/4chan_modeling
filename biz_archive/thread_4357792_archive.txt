Hey /biz/, 3 1/2 years ago I invested 1 btc in a certain IPO.
Needless to say that the Coin is and won't be finished but the exchange is still running and working.
There are still a few buy-orders left at like 1/4th of the original IPO price.
Since BTC went up 20x+ I'd still have made around 2k$+.
I messaged the dev and he told me that he is working on side projects and would buy the tokens back at 4 times the IPO price (I would be up 30k) if any of those made some money.
What should I do?
Cash out 2k or hope that the dev succeeds in a side project and cash out 30k?
Cash out
