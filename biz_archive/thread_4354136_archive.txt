You people are monsters.
Vitalik is clearly special needs and you are bullying him right now.
When he tweets, it comes from a place of pure logic without the constraints of social sensitivity or common sense.
He has a 200 IQ so you literally can't understand anything he says.
He speaks in literal mathematical arguments while you think in fuzzy emotional clichces.
You aren't fit to breathe the same air as him, much less debate him.
How about you go read a book on moral philosophy if you dare--sorry, if you can finish a book that is.
We both know you aren't qualified to have an opinion on anything except what your farts smell like.
What's that smell?
It's your arguments crumbling when exposed to the pure light of Vitalik's brilliance.
Wow, so you make some normies who can't follow a Big Bang Theory plot emotionally react to an argument they can't follow.
I hope you're proud of yourselves.
Congrats on this.
Seriously.
Are there betting markets where I can place wagers on when he flees to Siberia?
Op likes loli farts in the face
multimillionaire with weapons grade autism>feeling bad for him when he says stupid shit that affects my bank account.NO.someone neck this pedo.

Ya, the coin is solid with great fundamentals.
As long as it does what it is supposed to do, why should I care what it's creator believes in, as long as it's not illegal?
Actually this may be good to weed out people overvaluing the asset.
