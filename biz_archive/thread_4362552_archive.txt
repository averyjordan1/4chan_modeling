POWR is the one.
Web summit 2.0 confirmed.
MIT connection confirmed.
Get in or stay poor faggots.
POWR seems like a good long term investment regardless :)
No MIT connection per questions answered in Slack last night.
Do your own research...Its SLR
Here is the connection between solar blockchain project with an MIT and Leigh Travers is the "MIT" advisor who is mentioned in the PBRG reporthttps://au.linkedin.com/in/leigh-travers-b9a68235also: https://web.powerledger.io/mediarelease/
For those of you who still think its SLR... look at their website.
It's obvious that they have no marketing or business savvyness.
Their professionalism screams shitcoin to the core.
No white paper... No web summit attendance... Do you really think Teeka promotes shitcoins like these?
POWR being added on bittrex is too much of a coincidence.
Teeka pushed the PBC report to Nov 20th in his last video update.
Leigh Travers took a 12 week online Fintech course through MIT.He is NOT one of MITs "Great minds"!
powr is tyhe best lolol
You can say the same for SLR.
Where is the partnered derivative trader or web summit connection?
Nick Gogerty, founder of SLR:"...he is a top 1% performer as a portfolio manager for a long/short hedge fund (+20% v. -60% for S&P 500 2007-2009) and advises large banks on risk management, including the Flash Crash, and was a chief analyst managing commercialization for a science research institute modeled on the MIT Media Lab.
His primary fields of inquiry include biotechnology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, genetics, quantum computation..."He was also the Chief Strategist for Lykke, one of Teeka's other picks.
He chose not to attend the summit after the clues from the October issue made the SLR the obvious pick for November.
He and Teeka are well-aquainted.
