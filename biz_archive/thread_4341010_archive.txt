So, BCH fork is coming in 3 hours, this will probably fuck up BCash, but what does that mean for BTC, in the short term, like, in the couple of hours post-fork?
Will it even be phased?
I'm hoping it goes down just a tiny bit so I can buy more.And I love that Bcash believers are gonna get fucked even more by this scamcoin.
I dont understand why niggers think this fork will make the price go upNigga the fork will increase difficulty it will make BCH even more shitty

If the fork won't be good for bitcoin cash.
Why do the cash fans keep saying like this will be a good thing for cash.
