Fuck.About 24 hours ago I was about to go to sleep and logged on Binance to check the markets and saw a coin called Bitquence it was around 17k sats.
Of course it had already gone up quite a bit in the week so I wanted to buy the dip.Now look at it.Have you ever looked a coin but was too greedy to buy it at the current price just to miss your chance?I guess some coins are buy high, sell higher.
Eh don't think too much about it.
This shit happens all the time & you had no idea of judging what the real value of this coin was right?
