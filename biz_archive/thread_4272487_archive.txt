Less than 1 month ago my bf asked me to put some crypto , and I did put all my money in only one alt at any time.
Yesterday I posted here with only 6k.
Today I have 8k, is this pure luck?
Never go all in on one coin.But congrats, remember though you haven't profited or made money until you have sold.I would probably do that if I were you
Sell now or your balance will go down to 4k
literally how not to make big gainz
Erm, which alt ?
Where is the oct. dip ?

what did you buy?
That's only for my bf :pTokenCard (TKN) it has practically gone parabolic since I bought it KekThere is no dip because I sort of joined at a very lucky time, I bought right before btc mooned (bought @5.6k) also I bought Monaco near the bottom and sold at the top.
My new alt had a very strong buy wall (about 200k usd)Alt is TokenCard(TKN)

Since there are no roasties into crypto.
