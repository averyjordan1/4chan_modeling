Is there a general guide around here as to not be an idiot with your money?
Just finished reading Rich Dad Poor Dad and frankly, I feel like I'm massively behind as it is.
I've got no assets to my name and I'm nearly 30.
I've got a 401k with my old employer from years ago, a 401k with my new employer and a 3rd retirement savings account from when I worked for the county when I was 16years old and those are my only investments, ever.
And it seems like I massively messed those up.I just feel like I'm going to be working until the day I die at this point.
Invest it all in LINK
Same boat as you.
Massively behind and I don't have a greater understanding to NOT be stupid with my money
