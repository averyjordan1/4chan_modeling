I'm currently 30 grand in debt.I've been working bs jobs job hopping for the past few years when im in school.
usually $10 an hour fast food positions and $12-14 manufacturing.I just got a job starting a $20 with overtime.After I pay off my debts and take care of all my shit, what should I invest in?
I'm thinking flip stuff off alibaba/wish and use the money to invest in btc.
