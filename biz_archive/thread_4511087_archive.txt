Is Bitcoin done bullying alts?
Can't decide if they are hedging against BTC crash, pumps, or genuine growth.
Spent so long getting abused i don't trust anything to be organic growth in alts...
idk, im just waiting for my fucking litecoin moon since TA called it a few days ago and it has barely gone up 5% since then.
Litecoin is the same garbage as btc, get out while you can
