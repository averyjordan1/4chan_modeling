Well /biz/ been lurking here for a while and have some questions- albeit dumb questions to those of you that have been doing this longer.
Where can I buy and trade crypto currency?
And can I do it through mobile apps and purchase crypto with my credit card?
Do I need to purchase like .00001% of bitcoin before buying other coins?
Do I have to have some percentage of BTC in my wallet before I buy other coins?
How much money should I have before investing in coins?
Im getting a leisure check soon for 100$ and was thinking of putting it into crypto and holding it in there for awhile.
How do I buy bitcoin/other coins if im not able to use my credit/debit card?
I don't know how someone can stumble onto /biz/ and never had used Google before.
If you're too dumb to figure this out and do some research you shouldn't be in cryptoImpatient brainlets will only lose money
Figure Biz would give me a more easy to understand 'How-to' guide
They're the kind of people who's never done their homework before, just copied off other people's shit or keep asking nagging questions instead of researching it themselves.Worse than hitler.
Not impatient- just curious/

Is that from mommy and daddy gov in a socialist society?
