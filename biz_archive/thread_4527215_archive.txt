Is this the so called Alts Spring already?
Is this what it was like back in April-May-June?
Why is no one talking about how almost every alt is rising steadily, there is many threads when alts are bleeding.
No one is talking how every alt is literally booming.
Except for NEO, ARK, WTC.
The most shilled coins back in the days?
What happened to them?
Not really much people are buying into them anymore, right?
As theyre not the cool new projects.
Lets have a discussion and lets thank each and everybody for buying eachothers bags for the gainz.
All-in ARK and WTCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
