SO IS WRAITH OUT YET AHAHHAHAHHAHAH
Wraith is like bitcoin core but with torUseless, not anonymous
glad i sold this absolute shitcoin.
Going below 50 sats
Glad I sold for Litecoin right before the lightning announcement.
Luckily I broke even, and made a nice gain on LTC.
They hyped it for weeks.
"Muh not today to much work...muh sometimes chill guys" payout.WORST SHITCOIN EVER
must be time to buy again.
sigh.
I'd been telling people on normie book this was a shit coin for months and if they wanted real privacy there all the other options were much better.they kept calling me a retard and telling me verge is the absolute best privacy coin.
I'm so happy to see it at 79 sats.
XVG team is absolutely shit.Remember that XVG is a rebranding of a coin called 'Dogecoin Dark'.
So we know exactly what we're dealing with.
Might pump nicely after Wraith release but definitely no long term potential.

Y'all gon burn out and kys when this moons lmao
it's not gonna moon lel
Verge is the kind of altcoin that has such horrible fundamentals that it's actually possible it will just crash and burn from here on out.
Thanks based Twentya for the pump a few weeks ago though.
