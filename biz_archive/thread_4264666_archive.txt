Is iExec RLC any good?
Seems like a decent project.
All alts bloomed, but rlc is still flat and volume is low and the market cap is really low too.
Volume trippled since a few days, might be a good indicator
another boring nerd coin.
avoid if you are looking for gains>muh cloud>muh devcon>muhhhhhhhhh partnerships
Increasing volume, product just released, appstore in december, chinese website in december, Honk kong office, REQ partnership, report putting them 5 years in advance on crypto market, it was the 5th ICO in value of all time.
I do not even have to talk about serious is the team and their connections.
Do your own research though but seems to be the most confortable hold you can find
nope, there is 0 hype for this coin.
Totally agree but it is the easiest fix for a crypto company, a little push (but no PnD shit) and it will worth the real value that is at least 2x what it is now .
All the tech has already materialised on schedule, and they are even ahead of their V2.
Hidden gem
I think we have lift off boys
