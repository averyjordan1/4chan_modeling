Roger Ver orchestrated this pump and dump masterfully and after all that's happened you people still believe things might turn around.
What happened last night was not the free market choosing BCH over BTC it was just plain old market manipulation.
I was watching the BCH/BTC orders on Bitfinex last night.
Thousands of small orders to buy 0.3 BCH streaming in (clear sign of market manipulation done through bots).After this huge scam everyone who is not already emotionally or financially invested in BCH will avoid it like the plague.
BCH is not going to be able to rebuild its reputation after what happened here.
oh mannerisms?
fuck you
