The latest update from COSS was bad news.
I dumped everything after reading because it is going to go down a long way from here.Key points from the update and what they mean:- the UI "sneak preview" is terrible.
As another anon said, it looked like a graphic design intern's weekend project- Rune said the new UI can not be built until the new backend is in place.
So there will be minimal updates to the UI until the entire backend is rebuilt- There are *three* remote development teams building the project.
The project knowledge is split across three remote companies, which move team members around between internal projects.
Every time they add a new developer to the remote team there will be a ramp-up period before they can start delivering value.
Dev progress will be *slow*- Fiat gateways - the only reason anyone bought this crap - are basically postponed until they can fix the foundations.
Fixing the foundations means... getting the three remote development teams to rebuild the entire backend- Rune said he is currently getting quotes for rebuilding the backend.
i.e.
the development process hasn't even started yetIt will be Q1 2018 before they even start building the new backend.
Let's say they finish it in Q2 and then start the UI.
Then maybe Q3/Q4 start working on fiat gateways.
So they will be stuck with the existing UI for over six months, and the most promising feature won't even enter development for almost a year.
The idea (exchange with profit sharing and fiat gateways) is amazing and will see lots of competition, but I don't see COSS taking the lead in this space.
By the time they get to launch fiat gateways a new team (with in-house devs) will have eaten their lunch.
Should I just sell?
Honestly it doesnt look too bright
Yes sell now mr and buy powr
I did.
I took a slight loss, but that is preferable to HODLing while it bleeds out for the next nine months.
I've lost so much buying 30k at 20c I want to kms.
Still holding for the past month but fuck
