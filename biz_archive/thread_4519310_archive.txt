shit exploded *pun intended* ever since it got listed on binance.
was that solely due to the listing, or is it actually legit?
website says partnerships with Phillips and Microsoft.
still at $0.10 each.
Yeah, you have no idea the shit we had to put up with to get this on binance.
Most of us hodlers bought at 3000 sats.
Scrap the partnerships of any altcoin, it's just stupid hype, no coin actually "works together" with a big company.
But their products is already there, so its no proof-of-concept.
Its legit and extremely undervalued.
Once the main net releases and their customers starts using it this will go to at least its previous USD ATH.
