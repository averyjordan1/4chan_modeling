I'm a real newbie in investing so basically the title.
Seems like I can't even ask a question here.
The title was supposed to say "Now that the Tesla stocks dropped is it worth investing in?"

Any reasonable explanation?
As far as I know the stocks dropped because of Tesla's inability to produce newly introduced Model 3.
Won't they have better results next quarter as they finally move on with the production?
