I have .75 Bitcoin.
I can't afford to lose it.Should I cash it out?
Or gamble it on a shitcoin and get 10x?
gamble it
don't buy REQ
what coin not req
If you can't afford to lose it then the answer is obvious.Gamble it on the shittest coin you can find.
Buy .75 BCH, leave the rest on BTC.Enjoy the shitshow know you're comfy either way.
Just take a leap of faith and put every single satoshi into ASTRO, I guarantee it'll turn your .75 into at least 5 by the end of the month.
