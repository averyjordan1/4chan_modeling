Undervalued coin: BCPTJust listed on binance, we are past the initial exchange pump, and it has dipped to ico price now.This team is phenomenal.
They also have the cofounder of ethereum as their main adviser.
They are launching their venmo like crypto mobile app on fridaydyor but this is a buy for me
Blockmason is true keeper.
