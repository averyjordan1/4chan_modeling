They are on a big conference in London right now.
They are not allowed to announce yet which car manufacturer they will run the pilot with, but judging by the names attending this conference, it's not going to be a small fish.Jaguar Landrover backed, UK government funded.. why not pick up a few bags and let them simmer till Q1?

I just can't get over that circulating vs. total supply.
There will be a token burn, old news.
But even after that, a team member on Telegram mentioned that they are taking this concern into consideration.
Not sure what that means though.
