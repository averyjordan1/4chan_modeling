It's too late to invest.
Don't get burned.
ICO was $1, it was $2 one week ago, now it's flirting with $4.μRaiden will be usable without Raiden tokens anyway.
Note this 4$ for 23 novWe will see where the price will be in the coming days, so we will be able to see if you are an idiot.
This will skyrocket hard2 projects build by the same team who will use raidenhttps://www.raidex.io/http://trustlines.network/A shitload of projects want to build in raiden, like this one:https://smartmesh.io or this one https://gridplus.io/
Explain why it's bad to invest without saying it's done 4X.
I remember threads like this for OMG when it was quietly climbing where someone asshole kept saying it was stupid to invest because it had gone 4X ICO.
WTF DID YOU GUYS SHILL ME LINK INSTEAD OF THIS AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
I really don't know.
I bought a small bag yesterday but nobody is talking about it despite a steady rise and the uRaiden launch is a week away.
Seems crazy to me.
A MULTI B$ PROJECT.Well, it might, but it won't stay there for long.It's a great project and all, but people seem to forget that the token itself is fucking USELESS.
Once people realize this, it will get back there it belongs: ~$50M marketcap or even lower, but for now it's a nice p&d
