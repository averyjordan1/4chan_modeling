Feenix is currently trading under ICO price on ED with the super secret link https://etherdelta.com/#0x017188526374f723ec66509ea0c44dd797a33c84-ETH Should I scoop some up or is it a shit coin?
The ICO looks interesting but the tokens seemed a little bit overvalued.
It's a damn solid project imo.
I'm expecting this to hover around ico price once it hits exchanges.
What was the ico price?
when will be listed at tradesatoshi?
That's coming up soon too.
I kind of want to scoop up that 10k for 8 ethers.k for 14.4 ethers http://feenix.tech/purchase/
Whenever somebody gives them what is it 300 dollars?
You all are either shills or morons.Feenix is a scam coin.
Go to their website and try to Google any of their ""developers"".
I will gladly pay you 10 eth each if you can actually prove their devs aren't cheap Photoshop pictures for their fake project.Solid project?
How exactly?
Have they given any specific information?
Oh shit, that much?
When the guy was doing those airdrops I got 30k worth of that shit, you mean its actually worth something?
Nice man I think those were lottery style.
And yea dude people are taking notice.
