Somewhere an old man is pooping in his front yard on his iPhone 1 reading this very thread topic and he becomes so overwhelmed with joy that he will be able to give his family Curry and Basmati Rice for weeks.
He finally is able to release all of his bags of Shitty Tip Coins and he jumps up for JOY!
He forgets to use his left hand to wipe, but does not care.
He heads straight to his local Internet cafe with brown streaks sealing from his potatoe bag pants.
He sits down at the only open computer and wipes the curry from his hands, opening www.ShitCoinTrader.com he can barely breath, but then NO, disappointment sets in as he realizes this thread was a farse and nobody wants his shitty tip coin, and he starts to cry buckets of curry.
This is your fault Anon, apologize.
