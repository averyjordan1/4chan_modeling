what coins are you adding on the dip /biz/?LINK, STRAT, DRP
rlc, link, coss juicy prices right now
Lots and lots of ARK.Brand new wave of new money will be joining the next alt bull run that got into BTC during the last fork hype and all this bch drama and ARK is simply the easiest coin to shill to someone, redditors love it and it's easy to pump because everyone keeps in their wallet staking
Dude, ark is looking like a hellish investment right now.
Hellish?
It's an amazing time to buy, see f it dips even harder first though
All the popular bittrex coins look the same, everyone dumped to chase the bcc fomo rally.
It's perfect time to accumulate alts desu
Also VTC.
Back to $5.2 ez by tuesday
What if BCC rally keep going for another month?
Then we're all gonna be Pink Wojaks
I don't see that happening, IMO it'll end tomorrow when the difficulty adjustment kicks in and it will be forgotten about just like the last "flippening" attempt in august
https://pastebin.com/n0aGBMQrAnyone see this yet?
Probably just some REQ.
Kinda feel like between YCombinator and ING they really can't lose.
Even if they need to get institutionally pumped to make it, just like with BCH.
https://pastebin.com/n0aGBMQrYes that pastebin is from July, it was the propaganda used to started the last "Flippening" back in august when bch hit 0.5
