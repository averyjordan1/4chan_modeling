Be honest.
How many of you fell for the quantstamp trap?
Did you buy it during public sale?
kek!Ian Balina and his PND group they bought it during pre-sale 100% bonus.I hope this is your first ICO I hope you bought it during public sale.
Welcome to cryptos newfag.... kek
It's above ICO price, isn't it?
idiot, he posted on his twitter that it was under ico price and it was a good pick up at 5 cents, less then then 12 hours later it was 14cents, wish i read it at the time, i bought at .09 cents.
hes done more then shit posters like you
I was whitelisted for this but avoided it due to the presale bonus.
Anyways good to see it so high above ICO price, good thing for future ICOS.
