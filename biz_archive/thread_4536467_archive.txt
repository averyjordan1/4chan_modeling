KINKS ALL WORKED OUT..............all graphs say it's mooning soon..
Doubt it
enjoy your dead coin op
Opinions of amateurs, weaklings, and whiney losers are irrelevant.Real investors keep moving on...win or lose....XVG strong hands and a strong chin needed.
LOL At pathetic FUD.....BTC was called " Dead Coin" over 154 times over the years...look at it now....so just because you lost your $1 investment in XVG when you couldn't stand the heat doesn't qualify you to comment.
Why ?
How ?
Which signs,
Lol people got robbed of their XVG two days ago, the wallet isn't even safe.
The coin is DEAD and gone.
People loose coins to hacks and fraudulent exchange practices all the time jackass (Mt.
Gox) etc etc....It was the CoinPouch group who was responsible for any XVG Verge coin loses not the XVG team....what a load of moronic idiots here....why not do some effin research next time before spreading stupid FUD A-hole?
