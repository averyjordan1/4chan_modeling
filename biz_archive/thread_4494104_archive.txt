I've been trying to fix my life.
Addressing issues I left unattended, to hang over my head and contribute to my depression.
Its been a long process of repairing my life, but things are starting to look up.
I know, >fucking blog it faggotMy question here is about credit.
I could google the question but its all a bunch of boomers trying to sell me on credit cards.I have little credit history(just a few years), but I have an old account from many years ago I left negative ~$150.
Thing is they have reported the "late" payments like 50 times.
I have no problem paying it now, but has that ruined me forever?
Other than that I still owe $10k on my car.
If I pay the $150 balance off, will the Jew Credit Gods ever accept me again?
I'm not looking to take out huge loans or anything crazy, it just makes life easier when the Jewish masters aren't mad at you.>why didn't you just pay it offbecause I was deeply depressed for a long time and just hid my head in the sand>inb4 what coin is this
just pay it off you fag that's like one dinner at a nice place
tl;dr Should you pay your debts?Yes, now fuck off.
4494158No shit I paid it but I just want to know if I'm fucked for ever in the eyes of the Jew
You're ok op , remember all those nogs who never will pay back their debts
Everything falls off in 7 years.
I think payment history could be forever, but these late payments will be a smaller percentage of your total over time.
