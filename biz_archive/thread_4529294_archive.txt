I' new to TA.
How did I do?
I have 0.1 btc that's currently just sitting there and the BTC/BCH thing is making me nervous.
I feel like it's too late to hop into ETH so I'm looking for coins that dumped and are showing signs of recovering.
Currently have my eye on WTC and ODN.>Inb4 muh LINKI own 1k LINK but I think it's not gonna moon for a few more months.
It'll drop more still
Odn is a solid plan WTC could rebound too
