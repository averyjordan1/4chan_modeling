Do any of you actually know how to handle a windfall if your coin did somehow moon?
How many of you are just poor fags addicted to internet gambling?
i honestly have no idea.
iâ€™d probably deposit $250000 into my bank account and call a financial manager guy immediately after that
I'd probably just hold until it gets stolen or i die
I think i'm addicted but it's working and i don't even feel like i want the fucking money, i just want to beat the game
I've been taking profit by selling for cash to avoid taxes, but now I have close to half of my nations average yearly salary hidden in a box and I still live in a shitty student flat with a shared kitchen and bath.
I blame being preoccupied with my degree but part of it is I just enjoy having more money.
Not so much spending it.
>Not immediately buying a Lamborghini & a hooker whilst still being a NEET and living with your parentsIt's easy to hold if you're not paying a shackle berg, OP.
you will make it

location is easy now.
I'd immediately buy all the LINKs I could.
That should take care of any profits.

This place is looking like a self reinforcing poverty trap, it's pretty depressing to be honest.Does no one here have any interest in finance or actual investing?
