Reminder that Tether is not a scam.>B-b-but every time BTC turns has a pump, a large amount of USDT is suddenly created.
No shit?
Do you faggots even know how Tether works?
Its value pegged to the US dollar value and after a BTC pump, lots of whales (and others) will want to play it safe and go all-in on Tethers because they feel like the pump has ended and they will later rebuy the BTC dip and profit again.

Tether is the one that doesn't give a fuck when everything else is crashing.
Because hoards of retards constantly spout off about how tether is a "scam" and clog up the board with their brainlet theories
do you even know the mechanics of pegging and what would need to be done by exchanges to keep it at 1USD if there was a mass selloff of tether by users?
