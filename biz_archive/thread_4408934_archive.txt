so many coins have better tech and actual teamsTotally agree.
Most of them are working on BCH.
you're right.
it's not fair.
the good news is that while currency-only coins (like vtc) will always be shit on by the big guys, tokens that are used to pay for tangible services and goods, as well as the block chains these tokens run on, will be valued very highly due to fundamental earnings.This will only happen after they launch though.
2018 is going to be interesting for this, where hype meets actual usage.
Crypto will slowly be treated more like an investor space and less like a speculation space then.
More like the stock market.
go away!
