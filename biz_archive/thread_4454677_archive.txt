Hey guys new to cryptoI just invested $1000000 into BTCWhen do I make it?
Why would you do that?Put your money elsewhere where you can make 20-30% gains in a day or week.Get some btc if you want but at least try to make some money on the side too.
the past
How?
Interested to know the best, easiest way to move $1m fiat to BTC.
Convert at least half of that into ETH.
ETH is poised to moon.
BTC growth is going to slow.
Do you really think a real person really just put one million fucking dollars in btc
