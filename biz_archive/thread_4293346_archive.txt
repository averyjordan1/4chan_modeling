Have been toying with ETH for a month now, buying at $290 and selling just above $300 and have done it about 2-3 times a week and made decent profit.But I want to start sticking stuff away for long term HODL meme.I plan on leaving some in ETH for the long haul, but what else?
XRP, ARK, IOTA, LINK or NEO?
If you had to pick top 3-4 coins to hold for the next 2 years what would the be, and wat ratios?I was thinking maybe 40% in ETH, 15% in XRP, 15% in LINK and 30% in BTC
