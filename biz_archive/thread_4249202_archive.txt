They've launched Tokit this week , which is basically a DIY Token app.
Nice site too.Not sure how Singular works in terms of value but it feels like their stuff is pretty legit.
Wish they didn't have a shitty overcomplicated name.
fuck off cunt, their website look like a retard from biz just set up.
I figured it was a blockchain for TV So I gave it a hard pass.
Name is retarded.
But the website is perfect for normies looking to create something (movie, album, etc ) Curious if they'll grow their brand by getting big names to put their projects on here.
They got RUSS from Silicon Valley behind them (or the actor who plays him).
