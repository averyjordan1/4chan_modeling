Just put all my BTC into a safe haven ETP.
Thoughts /biz/?
Not on choice, rather converting to alts rather than fiat.
I really hope an alt boom comes out of this too, brother.
Will our alts finally get a break
Let's hope so.
God speed Anon, god speed.
I hold a lot of ETP, they are locked for months anyway earning gains so hope they moon
Yes.
ETP in *your own wallet not Bitfinex* is probably the safest play right now.
ETP is comically undervalued relative to other crypto assets.
I was just about to start accumulating.
I wonder what will happen to this coin with all the bitfinex drama, considering that it is pretty much the only exchange ETP is on.
