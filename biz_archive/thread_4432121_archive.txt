This just feels like its guaranteed to go $200 by end of 2018.AM I GONNA MAKE IT!??
>Using fiat price to get around the fact that NEO is worth less than half as much as it did at the top in terms of sats and you've effectively lost out on money by holding NEO
Too optimistic, but if you jump in right now, you'll profit.
Fortune favors the bold, anon

It's buy low sell high tho found out the hard way.
Kek because this is the most retarded rumor ever.
Wtf.
hurrr, everyone bought at ATH like my own retarded assbuy low, sell high, so simple.
Am I wrong that NEO is worth less in terms of sats than it's old price in the 0.012-0.014 range and that you'd have done better to just hold BTC?
Sold my bags for NEO, Definite moon mission inc.
currently checking up on luxury clothing and gourmet restaurants in my area...Don't even have the NEO tab open anymore, set the sell order for $199.
Might as well focus on the future now, where next I will invest my riches...

BRING ON ROUND 2 NOW!!!

NOW!!!
MOMMY MAKE HIM PUMP IT NOW!!!!
NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW!!!!
WE NEED MORE PUMP WAKE UP THE FUCKING GOOKS NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
why the fuck would you sell BEFORE the conference, fucking RETARD?
See ARK, LINK, and a bunch of other coins.
All went way down after big conferences.
Unless you got in early enough or the news is amazing, it can be risky with people selling after the hype has passed.
what time is the conference btw
Usually a good move.
What coin has ever continued to pump immediately AFTER a conference?
They almost always dip.
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SELL LINK BEFORE SIBOS ITS GOING TO BE $100 ON DAY 1!
4433662what if they actually announce that only NEO ICOs are accepted on regulated exchanges, allow NEO mining, and bittrex announces gas for NEOdo y'all still think it will dip if these rumors prove to be prove?
idts
neo mining wtf
Neo mining doesn't exists you can't fucking mine Neo
NEO ISN'T FUCKING MINABLE
you don't mine neo so those cryptowhale rumors are just bullshit.
because everyone is expecting SPECTACULAR news, and it never is, hence dump.
443374744337314433670SO when the fuck is the conference and when do we dump?
what if the "mining" is pos (gas) lost in translation
 days homie didnt u read the gook scribblesdump right before and then buy the cheap neos incase its some good news
https://twitter.com/CryptoKirby/status/931649106963042304I still don't understand how in the fuck can a coin pump this much only with (what mostly seems like) underaged trolling and a one fucking picture
https://twitter.com/CryptoKirby/status/931649106963042304 ey b0ss link pls?
Yeah, always sell at 0.01% profit
4433733Stay mad idts.
You just got proven wrong and can't handle it.
