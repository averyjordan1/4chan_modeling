This is Vizard group, a pajeet who has admited to dump on his members, also he doesnt know shit and photoshops news lol
You fucking moron.
I joined Vizard's little group.
Last Sunday we were supposed to pump a coin.
Big countdown.
The minute arrives Everyone waiting.
His story later is that his bot crashed when the announcement was due... but really he was busy buying up the shitcoin.
A few minutes later he announces the coin.
Everyone piles in and buys his bags.
The price dropped.
Everyone else sold.
The coin crashed.
This is the worst of the worst pajeet shit groups.
you're fucking stupid to join one in the first place.
I didn't say I bought anything asshat.
I just said that I joined to see what they were pumping in case it had a bounce after it crashed
while you guys argue, I get promoted.
