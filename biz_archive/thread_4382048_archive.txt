is it too late to jump in?
too late?
its on an insane dip right now, you're fucking lucky im bagholding atm.
I saw 100% gains go down to 30%.
Fools dumped when it's just on ED.
2 more exchanges coming.
I'm putting 5 more eth in when it bottoms then hodling.
i was too, just bought some more to average down, it should bounce back relatively soon.
Two exchanges will be announced tomorrow or friday.
One of them is Bitfinex supposedly, which is pretty good news.
It's low now too.Not too late.
