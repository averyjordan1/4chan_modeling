Anyone else here trying to earn money for the sake of earning money?
I dont even like sex, cars, mansions that much I'm pretty comfy with my mediocre life.
But for some reason i keep trying to become a multi-millionaire.
Did society brainwash us to chase the dream?
Ive become more stressed ever since ive become a greedy bastard.
what the fuck are you talking about?
If you're a comfy faggot then just wagecuck and fuck your fat ugly wife for the rest of your mediocre life.
Oh wait you don't like sex.
fag
you are a real life pink wojak
It's about the hunt
I do it as a hobby.
dun be a faggot op, make bank, live yo life dipshit
You seriously need to calm down.
I just try to earn a little to pay off some debts.
just remember anon, there's a living benefit to your wealth also.
It doesn't do you any good to hoard it all for your deathbed.
find fullfillment in the day-to-day, otherwise your life is just wasted efforts.
I like optimizing problems under constraints.
I like a challenge.
I like watching numbers go up.
I guess my hobby of making money is a result of video games as a child.
But maybe this skill is burned into the human spirit.
Maybe it's what were meant to do.
I don't want cars or mansions, I just want to never have to work.
That's what all this is for, freedom from wagekeking.
i hate people i need to be rich so i don't have to work and see people anymore.
I guess my hobby of making money is a result of video games as a child.or maybe it's just a mild form of autism.
(but I totally get what you mean.
I feel the same.)
My goal is fucking 100k.
That's it.
I will cash out after 100k.
I've never had more than 1k in the bank :/ currently have 50 bucks and no job damn shame...
