Conspiracy time, motherfuckers!This whole Bitcoin Core X Bitcoin Cash battle for the status of the true Bitcoin will never be resolved, because it is not in the interest of the market to settle it (and in the case of crypto “the market” can also be read as “whale executives”, since about 10% of wallets control 90% of the cryptocurrency, this important), since it is far more profitable for this to go on forever.
Let me repeat that: it does not matter if the war is real, it only matters that it is continuous.That is because this duality allows for efficient simultaneous pump and dump tactics of both cryptos, as in, if you have a lot of BTC and BTC price is high (which means that BCH will be low, since those coins CANNOT coexist with same value, or else there would be no battle for the #1 spot), you dump BTC at a high price, while simultaneously pumping BCH at a low price, which leads to FUD from the weakhands who think that it’s the flippening or are scared of too much loss and jump ship towards BCH, while the same thing happens with some folks that hold altcoins and want to try riding the wave, rising the price of BCH even higher than the whales pump, and in an erratic pattern, increasing even more the belief that BCH is on a rocket ship to the moon.Continued
However, in reverse practice, the whales (remember, whales=market) that bought BCH low now see that they can 3x profit from selling BCH at it’s peak (and since they are whales, the peak is reached the moment they start selling), and dump all BCH and buy BTC, that is now at a very low price, thus, gaining even more profit, since they shorted BTC when it was at an all time high.
So, for practical effects, the whales that are pumping and dumping win every time they make a move, and this is fueled because they spread a false fear that only Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash can exist as the true Bitcoin and “Satoshi’s Vision” (another propaganda scare tactic, Satoshi stepped down precisely because he didn’t want to dictate what he meant or didn’t meant for the crypto), when, in reality, it is in capitalistic interests that both coins coexist, at the same time that there is this impending doom that the flippening (or it’s complete dismissal) could happen at any moment, fucking up the weak hands and sending even more money (which means even more pnd power) in the hands of the whales.BASED ON THIS PREMISE AND KNOWLEDGE, (capslocking because you may not agree and truly believe that the flippening is a thing) the only way that you, poor BTC or BCH holder can profit from this is in two ways:
1- The safe way: if you truly believe that crypto is the future, and since you are buying crypto, I like to think you do (instead of daytrading a currency you think is just a fad, which is also perfectly valid), the safest way to ride these pump and dump events is to HODL like a motherfucker, regardless of you HODLing BTC or BCH, because if crypto is the future, then prices of cryptocurrency will rise, regardless of it being BTC or BCH (they may rise in different ways though, but you will make a profit regardless, just not as much, hence the safe way).2- The risky way: you are a clever motherfucker that thinks you can time the market and whenever these pump and dump events happen, you think you can ride the wave early, get out of the dominant coin as soon as the whales start dumping and get on the pump wagon as soon as they start pumping the other, profit, and use your mind powers to sell the coin JUST before the whales start dumping again, to profit by buying the coin you first dumped cheap.
In this way, you profit a lot, just like the whales if you time it perfectly ( you can run less risky and get out the ship in the middle of the dump, thus cutting your profit, but hey, profit is profit).
However, this is the risky way because if you get crippled by FUD and ride the wave too late, you will lose every time, think of the poor bastards that sold BTC at $6000 and bought BCH at $2000, those people were caught in a bull trap.
Mate people gotta take profits eventually.
Not everyone will do the hodl meme until they become broke.
If you REALLY want to get conspiracy (and fuck yeah you want to), you can speculate that the Flippening will indeed happen, but in a way that won’t kill Bitcoin Core completely, just enough that their roles are reversed and there can be always be a fear of a Reflippening just around the corner, ensuing that the battle rages on, just with the tables turned (remember how in 1984 they were always at battle with Eurasia and in the end of the movie they were always allies with Eurasia and were always at war with Oceania).
I conclude by saying that capitalism always wins, and it does not care about ideology, or who is technologically superior (if it were that, there are altcoins far superior, Litecoin would have taken over in Bitcoin pre-historic times), it only cares about money.Since I referenced 1984, here is a cool clip that can help you understand my point.

I explained on point 1 why HODLing leads to profit, it's just less profit, since there is less risk.
So /biz/, comments, opinions?
bump
tldr buy high sell low rich people are good investors
In principle what you're saying makes sense, but also is unsustainable.
Not due to some wishful thinking, but due to fundamental mathematical and economic principles but most importantly: game theory.The main reasons are:>Traffic paradox, Whales are independent people, even if they are coordinated they are still self motivated, no one can coordinate every whale because the world of Crypto is unregulated it operates on game theory.
It is always most beneficial for me to slightly out-smart even the people I operate with.
This is why EVERY discord pump and dump will fail, there is no incentive to actually cooperate in the long term when I can con everyone once and fuck off.
As a result with every pump and every dump people will sell lower and buy higher hoping to outsmart everyone else, this is the traffic paradox because of how people leave early to skip traffic so rush hour slowly shifts as more people leave 'an hour early to beat traffic'.>Normies influx, the normies are coming, they are slow and stupid and they may all be 'talking' about bitcoin now, but their talk usually precedes action by quite a bit.
Eventually they are going to bring trillions into crypto (literally, do not underestimate Normie money, just read up on macroeconomics, Normies are the most influential financial force it's why fucking Snapchat is worth billions) and normies will not in a million, billion years buy Bitcoin Cash.
Brands have intrinsic value, the Bitcoin 'brand' is worth at least 100 billion.
(Apples brand is worth about 150 bn iirc).
Even though you are correct, that's not what I said at all.
Not how it works
4320431They can't keep doing this multiple times it would be retarded.They gotta mainstream adopt it first or people will lose interest and just hop onto the Ethereum train or whatever the fuck alt coin.
