>friend told me about btc when it was 10 cents for 1>he explained poorly, I figured it was a scam or would go nowhere / be useless>spend my $300 welfare check on weed instead>could have 30 million dollars today>working at walmart part time minimum wage because there are no other jobs and I cannot afford an educationM-money well spentAnybody else completely miss your opportunities or just mess up big time?How are you holding up?
I missed some oppertunities too.
I am all in Chainlink now.
The idea is really solid.
Either it moons in 2 years or i am fucked up.
Chance is more likely you would have sold at 8 or 30 dollars like most people that got a big stack of BTC in the early days.
Could have bought 50k fiat worth of btc early 2015 but spent it on drinking and drugs.
Now I'm trying to become financially independent.
Could've 'made it' already but such is life.
so where is your friend now.
Did he put his $ where his mouth was?
Filthy rich laughing at you?
No he also bought weedHe suicided a while ago
% you wouldn't have any of it anyways.
The scope wasn't this big, and the market suffered some serious hits where you would probably have got out (see Mt.
Gox).You really can't beat yourself over this.
Lost
i always hear this argument.
If you had like 5000 btc bought @ 10 cents and btc goes to $10 or $100 or whatever, who the hell would sell 100% of their stack?
that would be legit retarded, when just selling half you're still up several thousand %
