It´s climbing and climbing, with no stops in sight.Get in here while its still low.You can get it on Etherdelta only, but new Exchanges are adding it soon.
This is still retardedly cheap, market cap isn't even 1 million yet and dev is burning tokens every day until total supply is only 2 million.
It's literally guaranteed to go up.
Should be a quick x2 by tonight if you're into that kind of thing.
Where does it say market cap is 1Mill?
50c x 5m supply = 1m
4300796Circulating supply is only 2 million.
Meh I can't be arsed changing my btc to eth, signing up, then transferring it.
Somebody made a PnD thread yesterday thanking us for removing his bags.
MFW I'm up 50%.
He was just fudding.This thing is gonna go much higher.
I had a good entry point yesterday, I´m up about 75% and it´s starting to get real attention.
Pretty sure this will still 3-4x over the next week, especially when it gets listed on the next exchange, because Etherdelta is pretty retarded.
