YOU HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO BE AHEAD OF THE REST OF THE WESTERN WORLD
I eat dog shiiieeetttt
me.
I'm the OP from last night that talked about NULS.
It was severely undervalued (was 9m cap when I bought), so I gave the shill a shot and went ham.
I knew it'd at least double but didn't expect it to rise so quick.
Cashed out and now am /comfy/.
A $40m valuation on a coin with no wp, no team, and no roadmap is insane.Team is supposedly delivering the WP tomorrow, so that should be good for those who bought at the high today.For it to go to $2, though, it needs to have an $80m market cap.
Not even VeChain (established partnerships) has that MC yet.
This is a pump and dump but you idiots are too dumb to take advantage of it.
This will hit 26000-28000sat in the next few hours as the whitepaper is released and then proceed to dump.
