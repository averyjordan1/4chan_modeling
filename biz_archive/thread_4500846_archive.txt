When the news broke, it was chaos and things were getting sold everywhere.
Now, people are preparing for a next panic, so you should figure out where the safe zone is.Obviously USDT is not the answer right now, so look for other things that are stable vs USD.
As Monero is being used in real life, unlike lots of alternatives based on speculations, it should provide some stability during hard times.Judging from the volume and price rise, more people seem to go for this strategy.
