Turned .032 btc into .32 btc in 30 minutes and then lost it all.
It was nice knowing all of you
wow What happened OP?
I've lost $7k in an afternoon.
And I'm sure others have lost even more than that.
.32BTC with a basis of .032 BTC is nothing to kys over.
You should probably kys for only having .032 to start with though.
Went all into something.
Idiot
The old martingale
Faggot.
Some polo whale lost over $5 million and some other sharks that were murdered tonight.
4324623Yeah I'm a single dad and lost my job, I was about to pull out and invest it all into a good coin.
