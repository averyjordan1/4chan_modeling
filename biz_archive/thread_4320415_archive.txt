Can you even buy or sell BTC atm?Is that the moment BTC will die?
Can you even buy or sell BTC atm?yes in the centralized exchanges
BTC is a shit mechanism for the processing of transactions.
It literally fails at the main purpose for which money was created.Of course this shit was doomed to fail.
Yesterday I sent BTC from my wallet to Binance.
Paid for priority.
Now 22 hours later there's still 0 confirmations.
This is not the future of money
and there are still people thinking bcc will not take over
Hahahaha you just lost all your BTC.
Normies BTFO
I sent two transactions last night around 2am right before the BCH pump and they took less than an hour.
You HAVE to set your shit to 800-1000sat/b.
To get anywhere.
Either HODL or pay to
you guys are fucking retarded ofc BTC will be slow as long as your slit eyed overlords you keep sucking the dick off keep mining BCHur all gonna get rekt when the difficulty shoots up>inb4 corecuck
Muh store of value
With fiat I can make a payment to anyone in seconds, pretty much anywhere in the globe.
Can you do the same with BTC?
No.
With BCH however it's always practically free and takes at most 10 min
Deposited some BTC to Cryptopia 13 hours ago or so.
Got 2 confirmations in 2 hours.
460 sats per byte.
