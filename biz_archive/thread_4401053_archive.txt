POWR have very strong support at 3k sats even in the BTC rally, this tells me people are buying this coin up hard
I too can draw a straight line across a chart
But he's right.
Volume has been increasing even with btc approaching ATH.
Look at it, the market sells are being soaked up hard
that's because some still think it's PBC's selection.
this will drop like a rock when the truth is out
 If it ever was, it still is
It ain't, well its a bit but most of this is because this is a solid coin
Also this, I got shilled in, then looked at the lifetime graph.
it's a steady climb, PBC or not.
