what hour do we sell this shit?
I'll wait a week or two.I say this because just 17 fucking days ago, POWR was exactly where this is right now and it went x16, so I'll hodl cautiously.
You're a fookin dumbass if you sell this shit now.It's gonna hit $1 in 1-2 weeks.
whats this referring too?
And I should mention that I retardedly ignored /biz/ when everyone told me to get in on POWR..... would have been the easiest +$15K for me since I almost bought $1000 worth.
maybe you just bought my bags?
I pass my HST...... to you!
ha!
sell....this shit gonna fucking moon in a month youll see
Sell when it starts going sideways, then buy the "correction" dip.
Then hold until added to bigger exchanges.
HST.4499400I went all in on POWR.
Cashed out today and went all in on HST.
This is exactly the same feeling.The calm before the storm.POWR was also under the radar before it goes bananas.
HST could really be the next moon mission, and it's coincidentally Australian too.
I don't want to miss out on this moon mission.
I'm tired of being pink with rage and blood tears every fucking day.
People love to bash /biz/ for being wrong, but literally every coin that has taken off dramatically since April was spammed here hard and I ignored it like an ass.
I usually don't take advice from /biz/ that's why I always do my own research.I did and I'm convinced with HST.
That's why I went all in.
ive just purchased.
Powr made me a lot of money, I went in mildly on this one only because I didnt get in on ICO like I did with POWR.
Should I take my 40% now or wait?
Had a small bag that I haven't broken even on yet cause it's been bleeding, do I fomo in more now?
That's not saying much, for every successful coin shilled here, 30 shitcoins are shilled too
