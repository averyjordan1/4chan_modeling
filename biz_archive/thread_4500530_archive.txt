Breakout imminent?Lots of development projects coming to fruition in December with claims that it will be ready to launch ICO's by end of year with several projects interested.ICO's launching on this network will have the advantage of not being tethered (like ERC20 tokens).They claim to be ahead of development deadlines.
I can see this going back to $10+ if their development releases are a success.AMA thread:https://www.reddit.com/r/stratisplatform/comments/7ddatk/chris_trew_ama_thread/

Hard to tell, both resistance and support tested well, actually resistance had one fake breakout so if anything the breakout will be downwards.
I feel like the general sentiment in the project has recovered a little compared to a few months back.
If the team can prove their reliability by actually carrying out what they say that are going to do on time, it will be enough.
Quietly mooning right now.
