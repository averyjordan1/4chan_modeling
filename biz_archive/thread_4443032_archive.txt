Want a guaranteed big profit?
Monero chart is looking so solid it's insane.
Cup and handle formed, strong support at current ~$130 level.
As soon as some more volume comes in (which will be soon), this is going to $200-$250.Buy in now for easy gains all thanks to THE KING.
lol 200 in a month maybeget in RLC if you want a moon mission over a week
Bought in at $105 and feeling so /comfy/
RLCLmao
implying it isn't the future monero is great and all but RLC is undervalued and impressive as fuck
>cup and handlemy favorite /biz/ meme
Next to using crest whitening strips to bleach your asshole.
% of my portfolio is XMR.
Pretty comfy hold.
Expect to double my money.
Why not 100%?
What shitcoin could possibly deserve the 20%?
Fair enough, I'll look into it a bit more then.If you actually think TA is a meme then you're a pleb and a half.
this is the absolute best coin out thereno question
I'm long on XMR short on BTC.
mfw XMR is literally the only coin that doesn't get crushed by /biz/tards on a daily basis>mfw so good even /biz/ can't find anything bad about it
If you like XMR, check out Aeon.
It's maintained by one of the XMR devs and will become the mobile equivalent and test ground.
Currently @ $2.30
Best coin as far as technology goes (or will be), not necessarily the best for making a profit though, even long term.
4443430this is how you know this will moon in 2018.When I want info on onther coins I usually visit XMR reddit and read about it there.
They are all so smart and good at explaining how everything works it's amazing.my research always includes a "what does the xmr community has to say about coin " point.

PLS HELP ME GOD.
