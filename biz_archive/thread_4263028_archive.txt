I Repeat nuls is a pnd
We don't need your type on the moon
Not with that volume
dont trust the chinks
Iâ€™m not kidding my pump n dump group went in hence you see all this shilling.
Take the loss if you want
Do you really think > no white paper> no code> no walletWill have higher success than say VEN which has established partnerships and all of this.
You guys are deluded and trusting chinks once again
Yea no offence but who the fuck would wanna pay 1 dollar for this coin right now when its clearly a half assed PND.
Ahem,I'm the OP from last night that talked about NULS.
It was severely undervalued (was 9m cap when I bought), so I gave the shill a shot and went ham.
I knew it'd at least double but didn't expect it to rise so quick.
Cashed out and now am /comfy/.
A $40m valuation on a coin with no wp, no team, and no roadmap is insane.Team is supposedly delivering the WP tomorrow, so that should be good for those who bought at the high today.For it to go to $2, though, it needs to have an $80m market cap.
Not even VeChain (established partnerships) has that MC yet.
