Deposits for Bitcoin Cash on Yobit are off.Just a thought, are they paying the exchanges to stop deposits and limit supply available to the market?
Would be a good tactic for pumping.
To just stop new sellers from entering the market.Anyone know an exchange that is taking BCH deposits, and I can also buy Monero?
exchanges halted BCH deposits/withdrawals for the hard fork.
it will be turned on again soon
Still, a Fucking great strategy to pump.
Imagine having the power to bar other sellers from entering the market.
Still, looking for an exchange that does both Monero buys and BCH sales.
