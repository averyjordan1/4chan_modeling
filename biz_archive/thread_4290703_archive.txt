Help!
I sold my bitcoin cash at $198 a while back on bitfinex.I was assuming it would crash farther with it's downward trend after the fork but I happen to sell probably at the lowest price possible.I realize I am dumb for selling during a large dip but it was all a very new thing being the first fork for bitcoin.Should I buy bitcoin cash?
What is happening?
I need some real advice on what you truthfully think is the future of bitcoin and bitcoin cash.
I assume it would be wise to wait for it to dip before getting some.
But does anyone really think bitcoin cash had a legitimate future?
