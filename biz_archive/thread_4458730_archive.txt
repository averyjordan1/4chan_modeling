Whats the best App for trading on the go/what do you use?
If you are a dirty jew, you can kys.
If not, then I like the binance andriod app.
Seems pretty seamless with their website imo.
No verification, lots of pairs, and low fees.
Also wondering, I use coinbase but limited to only BTC, ETH, and LTC.
Looking for an app that offers altcoins as well.
