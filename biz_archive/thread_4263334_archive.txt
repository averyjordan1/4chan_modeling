What’s the highest ripple will be in 5 years?
0.50$
$0.50
$0.50
its going to $223 in feb because the us dollar is going to collapse and the federal reserve is going to reset the debt and upgrade to a cryptodivide total gold market by xrps circulating supply
$120 in 5 years $1000+ 10-15 years
Anywhere between $1 and $5 is realistic.
$0.50 would mean that the XRP project has completely failed, which is unlikely imo.
0.80

$1 or 2 seems likely $5 seems extremely high and unlikely.
