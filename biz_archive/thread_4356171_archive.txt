Did the flippening started right now?Bitcoin on freefall
Maybe just a normal "correction".
BCH isn't moving yet, so.It's hard to tell when they are going to try another big push.
Accumulating and getting BCH out of circulation at a 5BCH to 1BTC ratio atm seems like their strategy.There are things they could be waiting for to make grounds more fertile, like clearing the BTC mempool more so transactions of BTC reachs exchanges, or even waiting for exchanges to add BCH trading pairs, which will have an upwards price effect overall.
Everyone has got it wrong.
Dogecoin is the true bitcoin.
The fact that dogecoin is still big and a thing both baffles me and warms my heart.
BUY MY FUCKING BAGS YOU PIECE OF SHIT
What universe do you live in?
BTC moves down $200 THE FLIPINGINGBTC Moves up $200 THE MOON
Where's the freefall?
I don't see anything yet.If BTC falls and BCH flatlines, then the extrapolation is the sale is going into fiat.
That means people cashing out their BTC are simply cashing out their winnings.That means they profited from buying BTC.
free fall from 6600 to 6599
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
flipening wont work anymore.
koreans destroyed anyreputation bch had with them shitty PnDs.
now even if they pump like hell all the bagholders will cash out the moment they breakeven.
