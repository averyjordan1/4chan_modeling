Does being fat hinder you in the business world?
No one takes oversized man babies seriously in life
lol
Depends how you carry it.
Being slightly overweight but wearing the right clothes unfortunately gives you more presence/dominance.
Being an absolute fatfuck slob on the other hand has the opposite effect.Understanding social and business etiquette (Most people dont and just blunder their way through these things thinking they know) is far more important in the long run, and its better to be relatively fit as it naturally makes your more confident, intelligent and enjoyable to be around.
No.
The bigger the stomach, the more you are able to eat the competition.
