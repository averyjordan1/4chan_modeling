Is buying & renting out crate homes via Airbnb a good way to get passive income?
Depends of the location
I'd love to live in a larger one of these, isn't it cheaper to build them instead of a normal house?
I've looked into this.
Depends on location and the condition of your container home.
For example where I live regulations make it not allowed to even build a house from a shipping container
There's a nice "Grand Designs" episode where a guy builds a lovely house with two or three of these.
Guess what, I went and found it for you:https://vimeo.com/147232218you're welcome!
Doesn't sound passive to me if you're managing more than a few.
Wouldn't regular landlording be better?
Beautiful !
thats just a normal housr made to look like it was made from shipping containers
cratesyou still have to refurbish the crates as houses, which can cost 30k per crate.
Muh hipster real estate trends.This is a fad OP.
Properties like this won't be making money in less than 5 years.
