tiny 4m mcap>still goes downGoddamnit I bought at $2.41 go up already.
Nice pick anon, their lack of whitepaper prevented many whales from buying.
I guess the hydra release or any other bigger news to come will make IoP expolde, not to mention nodes and running decentralised stack that alone should make market cap of hundreds of millions of $ and it comes in December
Seriously though these bags are getting heavy and my hands weak.
Feels like I would be better off selling IOP now and trading other coins for a week then coming back to this.
Is there any reason to expect this to make considerable gains in the matter of days?
The news don't seem to have affected it much.
The fundamentals are far superior then the price.
It can moon without any news.
This coin is having higher ambition and better tech then many 50m+$ coins, even hundred million coins.
All it needs is to be spotted by a few whales and it will be there fast because of the low circulation mooning is gonna be fast.
Don't hold me for my word anon but this can pump any time.
Yeah this is my reasoning as well, it's absurdly undervalued, which is the reason I didn't sell the news.
However the crypto world isn't always logical, so you never know.
I'll just stop looking at it and hold onto my bags, I'm sure it will eventually at least 4x (more if we start talking 6 months), had just hoped it would be a faster profit.
Just read their bluepaper.
It is awesome.
Market cap 4.5 mill $ - Fucking undervalued.
It will be min 100 mil $ in a very short time
Yeah!
Titania whitepaper coming tonight!
I think we just need to survive black friday as many will take out some money to buy something and after that a smooth sailing towards moon
I have 30... will I make it?
