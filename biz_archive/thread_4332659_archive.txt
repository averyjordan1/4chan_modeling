Latest BitBay Community Update
Why the heck did it drop so much today?
Why would anyone want to invest in this shitcoin?>muh rolling peg will make us moon!Hey dumb dumbs, the rolling peg is going to stabilize the price, so this isn't the moon mission you're looking for.
Note that the rolling peg is only intended to *reduce* volatility - not remove it entirely.
Some people mistakenly believe it will permanently freeze the price, but in actuality gradual increases as well as decreases in value will still be entirely possible.
The peg's main purpose is to make the BAY currency viable for consumer use on the BitBay Market client.
An example for why this would be useful can be taken from my own experiences shopping with Bitcoin on www.overstock.com - by the time I had sent my BTC, the amount requested had changed in value dramatically enough to nullify my transaction.This will not be an issue when the Rolling Peg is finalized.
Again, no moon mission.
Why would people want to be invested in this?
Well, it's sort of a Catch-22 here - you want a moon mission, but the feature that would predicate the moon mission seems to scare you off.
I can assure you that in the grand scheme of things we're doing the right thing in attempting to reduce volatility in order to provide a consumer-friendly shopping environment.
BitBay as a viable alternative to eBay, Amazon, Fiverr etc.
as a medium of exchanging goods and services, will be worth far more than BitBay as a speculative investment.
Also here is this handy infographic explaining the differences in value propositions between the BAY platform and other decentralized marketplaces.
