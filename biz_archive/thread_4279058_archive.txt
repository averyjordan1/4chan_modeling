4279665yeah, 2X fork back on the menu, the higher pricing for futures on Segwit2X is driving Bcash higher....and theories floating around that Bcash will be favored in upcoming days by miners, thus sucking support away from faggot BTC...there's just too much fuckery going on right now to be long alts that aren't supported by their own fiat value.
that's why i like XMR for these periods...it looks to be on a new uptrend after this clear confirmation.
i don't think we'll ever see it under $100 again.
