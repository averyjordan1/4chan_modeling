I wanted to buy this shit, and was gonna tell people to get ready for it to TANK, because every time I buy shit tanks.But I cannot leverage this shit because BCC has exceeded the maximum aloud volume.So, my theory is that this shit is gonna moon hard now that I can't buy the fucking thing.OH LOOK $1740 I CANNOT BUY IT, WOW WEE FUCK THIS SHIT.
If you donâ€™t get in now when all those unconfirmed transactions go through they will be going all in before you
>IT SHOT UP TO $1770FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK, I could have leveraged and have 10k by now.
This fucking piss poor excuse for a broker, will not let me waste my cash on this shit, fuck it all.
Go to short BTC instead, it starts to moon.>Can't short it because the options greyd out anyway.
I just shorted BTC, now BTC will go up because it already dipped, I'm gonna get out at $5950 ish.
COME ON LAMBO LAND.
