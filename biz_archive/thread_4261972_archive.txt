best coin of all tiem
Gj arkies if i wasnt all in a other project iwould have been in ARK hope you guys get far
Looking to drop some of my hard earned gains into the ARK.Some one shill be the coin without saying moon or mentioning ridiculous price estimates.It's either ARK or leaving it in ETH
tfw this is a real possibility
Are we gonna makeit ?!
if i put my ARK on a wallet that's connected to my ledger nano s, then i could delete the ARK client off of my desktop if i wanted to and not worry about losing my ARK, right?
ARK is going to be achieving what ETH has, but only better.
ETH has already failed several times before with multiple security flaws.
Plus, if you check out their road map, there are many projects set to be completed in 2018.In addition, if you go all in on Ark, you can stake it using biz_classic.
This will allow you to make money using your money, something you can't do with ETH.
I'm making 30 or so ARK a week (~$100 USD),
yea I know you can vote from your ledgerbut uh, I think they have a slack so y'knowDYOR
Why is it blowing up ethereum tho?
Ark > ETH
isn't there a biz delegate?
how many ark do i need to join?thanks ill check it out.
ive never actually used slack
yea you wanna go here:https://classicdelegate.biz/dashboardno minimum to join but you need 50 ark to get triple from the faucet
thanks for the link.
ill stake my ark as soon as the bittrex wallet allows me to move them
WTF ALL MY LINKS ARE GONE
If you trade on an alt coin exchange that doesn't have ark listed, consider sending them an email or request ticket, even if you think the exchange isn't the best, the exposure is important.
Few examples:https://liqui.io/https://www.livecoin.net/https://hitbtc.comhttps://bitbay.net/https://poloniex.comhttps://allcoin.com/https://wex.nz/https://yobit.net (has a surprisingly large volume on certain coins like Lisk and Waves)https://www.bitcoin.co.id (Indonesian exchange)https://bx.in.th/ (Thailand exchange)Start small with these exchanges and as this coin grows we can get ambitious with higher volume exchanges.
