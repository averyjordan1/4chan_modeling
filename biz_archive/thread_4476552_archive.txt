No resistance.
Could this be it?
after NEO and LRC moon, ETP this time?
It won't moon just yet.
Wait for Binance/Bittrex listing then we can talk.
That could happen literally any day.
The key is to strap in before the rocket takes off, not 50% upTA suggests that ETP could break out anytime in the next 48 hours.I'm all in long.
Is this trading software linked to an exchange or what exchange?
Where are claps still allowed to trade this again?
I'll swing trade my bags a bit.
ETP has been supported at $3, the support has been tested times and times and still stable, I think this is a very strong bullish sign.
All weak hands shaken, once the price lift off, I expect at least $7~$10 short term.
It will go back to 3.2 for suresomeone always short the shit out of this coin.
maybe 3.3 is a new floor
So what you need to understand is that with BTC falling, this will fly up.
Bitfinex short against alts to increase liquidity etc.
Bitfinex will be buying back shorts, so regardless of what people do, it should rise if BTC is falling.
yes, BTC sucked alt dry
let me show you the original truth
So is this good or bad?
The floor is 3; the WAVG accumulation price.
It's not going below that no matter how hard Tether destroys the market.
