No, I missed the ICO and bought 250k on Binance at 0.001 from pajeets like you that bought into biz shills and got rekt big time.
I'm comfy as fuck with this project desu.

Worst larper i have ever seen.Now it's confirmed, you bought at ICO prices.
Feeling sorry for you, but with this attitude you deserve it anyway.Never hit 0.001 on Binance, fcking pajeet.
>Inbefore searching for the lowest price and redeeming his original statement.
You'll be bagholding forever.
This shit is rolling straight into oblivion while the devs fucking 10yo girls in Thai.
It's literally your last chance to sell
just sell it all now and buy bitcoin for the hardfork in 1 hour ( https://coin.dance/ ).
Easy money
It was.
Binance fucked up with double deposits which caused panic sell off.
I don't remember the exact price, but it was around 0.0001, maybe 0.00011
Man, I want to be like you and help others to earn money.
You're such a good person, kind sir.
A saint, literally
yea I don't know why people just don't listen.
Why hold and do nothing, possibily losing it all.
If you can instead just make extra 10 - 20% now and also increase your holdings afterwards without any major risks involved?Just listen and sell as fast as possible.

OMG = several partnerships with muttliple million / billion companiesYou mean selfies in the lobbies of the Cambodian division of Burger King?
/biz/ in a nutshell - Only skateboards and selfies, OMG got nothing elsedo your fcking research outside of /biz/ and you would know it yourself.
Fuck you I have yet to see a single skateboarder mention the only truly valuable partnership OMG has.You're all just amazed by dumb stickers at the bottom of his skateboard.OMG holders are brainlets and you don't deserve the gains you're going to get from things you're not even aware is coming.
omg had it's moon and req still has to get it.
it wasn't a "panic sell off".
it was just people selling their free REQs at market prices and eating up every buy order until it was at 0.00011.
