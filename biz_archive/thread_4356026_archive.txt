Elon Musk's Telsa AU division will partner with POWR.It will be the first real world application of a crypto ledger within public infrastructure.
Perth will be the first city this is used in.
I won't buy until I see a Tesla sticker on her skateboard
What about grid+ though instead.
Australia is a meme.
Nothing Musk touches since paypal has ever been profitable.
Lol its great that you think that, how about you prove to us how it is you can say this :)
Nothing Musk touches since paypal has ever been profitable.SpaceX is highly profitable you deluded retard.
australia is full of complete psycho's.
It's basically a government agency funded by an arbitrary amount of tax shekels.
Hey wait... POWR ledger involving projects will probably be subsidized as fuck.
The profits that can come from corruption is ackbar.You're right, I'm going all in.
One should never underestimate government money thrown at their favorites in the private sector.
It's basically a government agency funded by an arbitrary amount of tax shekels.So is ULA by your brainlet logic.
except SpaceX will save the taxpayers billions over the upcoming years.
Also, you really are deluded if you think Tesla will use this shitcoin.
They will probably adopt blockchain eventually, but they will create their own.
So is ULA by your brainlet logic.Well, yes.
Public funding, private profit.
POWR COMPANY STEALS $20K WHEN ASKED TO DEVELOP BLOCKCHAIN TECH FOR SOMEONE.https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/73zjv8/we_are_the_team_from_power_ledger_creators_of_the/dnugpyd/
https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/73zjv8/we_are_the_team_from_power_ledger_creators_of_the/dnugpyd/YES !!
see I also hear that their dev team left all of them and that ASIC and the tax man are coming after them.Reading this just seals the deal for me.
I am from Perth and know some one that is close to some one who was part of the team cant name any names for professional reasons.
Can you give any info as to why the dev team left?
Dude just fuck off with the shilling and all the bullshit.Anyone with half a brain knew about this long before the crowdsale.
Its always been a long term hold and the gains arent going to be nything special.POWR got picked up by a pnd group and almost instantly we went from months of no talk to lots of threads every single day.
Kys all of you.
My understanding is they don't like the way 'management' work greed and i guess false promises given what the other poster said about shady shit it makes sense now :) so the just banded together and left.
lies theres no such thing as green energy in perth powered by power ledger.
its just a shitcoin that got shilled too far.
you will never get a divident from it
