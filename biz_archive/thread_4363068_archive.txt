Is there a reason why this wont moon mid 2018?
I have a feeling that this is the year to buy and hodl.
I bought some a while ago and I got my balance taken into custody by the foundation.
Still don't have it back even though posters said they're returning them on Monday.
I don't want to put anymore money into this.
