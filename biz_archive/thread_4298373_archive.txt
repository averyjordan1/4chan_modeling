JUST
trying to move a small amount of bitcoin hours and still no confirmations.5 BTC moved in same transaction showing as already spentBTC is fucking dead if I can't even move $40 worth in a day
WHY IS IT STILL NOT DUMPING MORE EVERY TIME IT BREAKS THOSE HUGE WALLS AT 6500 SOME SHITTERS PUMP IT AGAINAlso where is the best place to see where the market really happens ?
Bitfinex ?
I told you guys it's going down to 4k.
Did you listen?
No.
bitcoin wasnt meant for this amount of people.
it was invented by a nerd for the lulz and was memed like crazy.
the thing is after all These years its still only an imaginary meme coin
Lord i beg of you, have mercy on my soul.
Please forgive me for all my sins.
Lord , if you can make the price go back to $7500 you will have my devotion for the rest of eternity.
Please Lord save me.
And thats exactly why segwit2x hard fork was necessary.
BCH is gonna fucking own BTC because that fork was cancelled
