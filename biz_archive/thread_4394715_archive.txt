I changed my mind on banking out on my Bitcoin - I want to keep it in the cryptosphere and make a cool mil.Is there a stable currency I can trade for right now, before I smarten up and then can actually start playing the crypto game?
I really know nothing at this point, but I have a lot of money in bitcoin and want to secure it before it crashes down and it hurts inside.
Eth hasnt moved in 2 monthsBut it's got the second largest market cap.It's not going anywhere
ether and litecoin seem like pretty safe betsremember though that if bitcoin is going to come crashing down most alts will get taken down too
ETH, LTC, DOGE
Do you hate gains?
New BTC ath incoming this weekend if not tomorrow
+ XMR
If you want stable currency then cash out to fiat, faggot.
We are here to board the moon mission, not for some normie stability.
