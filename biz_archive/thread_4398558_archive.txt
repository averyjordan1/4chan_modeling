On Bittrex it has 22k buy orders vs 7.5k sell orders.
It seems like (((they))) are slow dumping this coin to buy it low and then pump it up again.100% serious, should i hold and wait for the next pump or just dump it now?
Shhhh, let the corecucks remain oblivious to this I want them to go full JUST
of course you should hold, it can't go much lower and it will definitely go up again
im waiting for the new btc ath and then bch up again
And then swap it back to btc.
it can surely go back to $300 over the next month.I'll put my life savings in at that price.
Still up 3x overall after monorolling BCC right before the pumpBought back in at 0,155 tho so I am getting JUSTed in real timeI'm here for you bros
hold me bro
Just HODL champ.
It always comes back.
at least to where you can break even.
Never sell in the red.
holding here
You know it maneThe Koreans must have at least one more decent pump in the tank, and Roger Ver & al.
are waiting to dump BTC at an ATHWe may still get JUSTed but there's always hopeOne love
Ever touching this trash in the first place
No it can't.Like you say, you'd put in your life savings at that price.
So would everyone else, which is why it'll never go that low.
The ATH was over $2500, even a down syndrome kid would know to buy this as soon as it went below $800.
There are large funds and service providers that are dumping their BCH for Bitcoins.
Some of them such as BitMEX preannounced it.
ew.
you are such a disgusting faggot.
Core Maximalist detectedBlow me hombre
But we all got it for free?I'm hedging my bets, holding this and BTC.
First sign of a pump and I'll ride it.
There exist cucks who somehow paid for it
