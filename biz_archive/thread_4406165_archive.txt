Total brainlet here.Is it smart to cash out alts into btc when btc is high like now?
Yes anon, make sure you buy when it's high, and sell when it's low.
No, unless you are certain BTC will make a rally towards $10K tonight.
That is when you could sell and re-buy back at a lower price
yesbuy highsell lowrepeat
I just went all into a coin.
Should I immediately sell right now at a small loss?
