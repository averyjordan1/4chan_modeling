You were warned.
What about ETH?
why?
nice just sold 100k
BTC vs BCash fiasco is just getting started.

Whales are pulling the rug under your feet.
I'm warning you early.
Fuck it I'd rather going down with this ship than take it out.
except for eth**
Regarding ETC, I asked myself why but I have no answer, how about you tell us.
I'm taking all my coins off exchanges that aren't backed by real moey btw.
