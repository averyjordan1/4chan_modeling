Currently at $0.24Promising coin if you want a long term hold guys.
feels good investing in a good coin once in a while
Long term?
No.
This will pump hard now.
The valuation of this coin will be astronomical as it gets put to real use.For any of you guys out there that don't know, 1/4 of Australian household use Solar Panels.
So this is kind of a big deal.

This is huge as the aussie government are cunts that love coal and oil.
For them to be backing power ledger is fucking massive

>$300 million market cap>for $8 million grantI'm not very good at math, but this doesn't look right.
I live in Australia Our government is incompetent.
We just spent $120 million on a postal survey for gay marriage during a time of stagnant economic growth and debtOur internet is worse than many African nations I don't have a lot of hope therefore for a successful government-led internet based investment..
How is this government-led you spud.
It's a grant for a project that is utilising POWR as a token of currency.
This is all good news, it doesn't matter who is funding it - it matters that POWR is being used as a working product.
poor fag shit holeall the new houses are built in shit holes dude.all the good suburbs are in established ones
 to 400million you mean.
??
ABS said today final cost will come in below 100mil
Story Deleted:^)
This is really more a way to make democratised private power, rather than just few companies owning all the power and making all the deals.It'll be pretty kewl.

They estimated for it to come to 400m, but it's fucking dumb as shit.
Do you have a source?
Not insulting, honestly want to see it.
Everything I read said around 120m.
And now they're saying it came in under.

Wait no that was some other shit, fuck it.
trading distributed resources including water.What's next, trade air on the POWR blockchain?
clean air with an air purifier in the near future if trump keeps trumping
It's so sad to see someone unable to catch hold of the pure joyful mirth contained in his every glorious tweet.
God bless that beautiful mess of a man.
