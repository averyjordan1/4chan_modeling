why is bccbtc so illiquid on binance now?
for the past week it's been really choppy like pic, before it was okay.
same with xmr, the only pair that is good is ethbtc, even neo is illquid.
I didn't notice volume change, how to see per exchange?
Because its only on there for arbitrage, not actual trading
it was much better a week ago
