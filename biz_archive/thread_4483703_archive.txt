I'm thinking of starting an exchange which allows for direct stock purchases with crypto, without the need to cash out to fiat first.
Should i try for a venture round or just run a shorty ico?
Ico sounds easier (can use tokens instead of paying transaction fees for exchange).
Having at least a seed round from established VCs will make the ICO easier.
Legally, this is going to be expensive.
