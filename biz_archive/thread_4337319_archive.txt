Why is this shit not recovering and still -17%?
EVERYTHING ELSE RECOVERED.
>muh comfy hold>muh solid team>muh good projectThis shit is dead money when LITERALLY everything else would make gain.
It didn't even pump yet.
Fucking hell, why do I always fall for the memecoins.
:(
If their branding didnt suck so much, this coin would moon.
Maybe its a hidden gem right now.
someone is surpressing the price, since it has no volume its easy
Hopefully they'll do an okay job with the China marketing over the next month.
It really deserves so much better, this coin.
I still have hope.
Bag is heavy
Some Supercomputing event they're at ends on the 14th, so maybe there's still some time.
Alternatively, the volume is very low because the big guns figure they've already struck gold and will just hold it throughout the next few months/year.
Nothing will happen the 14th.If you are really impatient, sell now and buy during the last days of november, if not hold, this will not move under $0,50 anyway.
