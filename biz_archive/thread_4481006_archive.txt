Oh shit.
I think it's time to get up in some NXT.
Ok, it's about to happen.
If you're up, and you're in, you are about to make some money.
Prob last good chance on this...
isn't nxt shuttung down in favor of ardor?
I don't know about that, but I mean like right now... check it out...
Damn missed my chance
I don't know, man.
it stalled out a bit, but I think this will hit 1600+ in an hour or so.
Full disclosure, I do not have money in it.
I would, but I already went in on VERT earlier, and I didn't want to move it around.
Don't think it's shutting down blockchain entirely.
You'll get .5 ardour for every NXT soon.
I have to bail, but I hope you guys make some money (stop-loss at 1205)
bump
Dude, you have hit them with some pumps AND a bump Ok, I'm for real out now.
