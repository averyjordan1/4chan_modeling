Do you know why BCC went up?It is becausa D.Va, largest korean coin pumping group.All the coins that D.Va picked,the price went up.The coin NEO was frozen,so it started off as a minus , but ultimately price went up.I will now only follow D.Va picks.t.me/DvaPump
It's a tough choice.
Make money unscrupulously by getting into bed with a bunch of shady gooks, or be forced to make it on your own with less of a chance for success
