Food & Medicine are life-essential products, but because of the way today's global supply chains are run, most of us do not know what we are really getting when we consume food or use medicine.At the Ambrosus project we aim to radically improve the global supply chains by creating a trusted ecosystem where we can reliably record the entire history of products and execute commercial transactions accordingly.We seek to enable a more secure and autonomous supply chain, improve distribution processes and allow consumers to easily see where their products come from and what is really in them.Get in now!!
">Missed the MOD moon" Are you inept?
I'm inept.
I more than doubled my money on MOD.
I call that a moon.
Who the fuck wants this?
What company is ever interested in this shit?My god you guys are retards.
Clearly you are too stupid to read and comprehend a whitepaper.
thinks exchange listing equals moonjust gives ICO whales more options to dump bags
fuck AMB and fuck gavin wood too.
MOD will be first to market in this space and AMB is seriously overly ambitious.
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU FAGGOTS BUYING THESE FUCKING SHITCOINS?!!?!?!?
Should I dump my mod bags at a loss for this?
Ok I fucking did it all in at 4500.
Let's go boys.
AND I ALREADY GOT DUMPED ON DOWN 10%
easy 2x with the corporate backings of this company
4286315now that is funny.
>currently slightly below ICO price of 1 ETH for 1000 AMB.
Down 20% now....god please pump this shit so I can get out.
Let me out.
FUCKING AUTIST GET HURT HOW MANY % NOW IT WAS ALREDY BELOW ICO BEFORE BINANCE
Probably going back to 0.00076 or 0.00077
Sell now and rebuy low it will be listed on KuCoin really soon
Someone is trying to pump it but keeps getting dumped on.
Help me I want to sell for Bitcoin Cash.
After selling MOD for a loss you are now going to sell AMB for a loss then the moment you buy bitcoincash it will dump.
