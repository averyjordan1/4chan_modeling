since bitcoin reached $8000 you think the media will jump on it and crash it?
You give the media far too much credit.
Nah, it's not a huge psychological barrier that would get people excited.
$I do anticipate them discussing it heavily if it hits 10k and that's when some real FOMO will kick in with normal people.
Plus we just had our 'crash' so don't expect another for a little while
if smb with no finance skills at all wanted to invest in bitcoins which side would he have to goasking for a friend
