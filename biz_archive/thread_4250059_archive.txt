We were expecting a 40% retrace after the fork.
Now there is no fork.
Is bitcoin seriously going to make a run to 10k or will we be seeing 5k first?
Most idiots thought they were getting free BTC which is why they went into it.
Money's going to start flowing out at a frantic pace once people start selling off.
I'm expecting it to cruise back down into the 5K range.
I too think this could happen.But this market's just crazy.I guess 10k is even more probable now than it was before, it's nuts.
This.
Think of all the new weak hands.
This shit is gonna be the greatest cascading crash we've ever seen.
Blockfolio has given me a hard on in this moment.
Weak hands shitted their pants and in that little slide sold more than Wall st expectedThey got nice chunk of control and will play along the original chain at least for some time ahead
Same thought.
I'm really confused why BTC mooned so much after it was called off.
I thought this would trigger a panic sell
