So i was watering my tomatos this AM and i decided to get some macdonalds breakfast (yumyum) and so I'm sitting at the drivethrough waiting for tyrone to hand me my drink and thats when it hits me: man I need to start making moneyI get home and for some odd fucking reason i cant even FIND any catsup to put on my sausage egg mcmuffinTHEN a bird hits my window... i go to check it out and what am I left staring at?
Yes.
Tomatos.
At that moment it seemed very clear to me: you must build a catsup company from the ground up.
Better catsup than any other kind even frenches.
Besides how hard could it be?
Don't you just smash tomatos and put some sugar/salt and texas pete in there?
My mom is getting me and the ole lady a blender for christmas, and I'm thinking with this we can start jarring our own catsup.How hard would this be to do?
At what point do we become liquid?
Also, how much money do you think I could make, being a catsup tycoon?
I've never rented space before, but I'm pretty rich (thanks Antshares!)
and i think all I would have to do to do that is talk to someone who is renting out space like that?
Like a factory or something?What are my odds of success and how soon shall i begin this journey?
Your odds of succeeding are 0 if you don't even know how to spell ketchup
You sound an like autistic NEET who got lucky with NEO.
