I'm once again a deluded ARKIE after I just woke up
welcome back to Deluded Town
Trading is hard.
sold all my ARK for BCH last night before bed time, comfy I plan on riding this for a few weeks and hoping ARK stalls at $3-3.5 while I'm riding the whale (Also fucked up and have 7 LTC on hold for 5 days so I'm not on top of my game) will invest in BCH until I see the first major dip (Around Coinbase release) and will Drop ship and back on to ARK but this time with triple or more shares than when I started.
