https://etherdelta.com/#HST-ETH2 exchanges released in the next 5-7 days: they have a working product and customers so Binance is definitely high probability.Strong support developed in .0008 to .001, good time to get an easy 2x with exchange news.team is good, buy now if youve been reluctant
Been in since .00058 haven't sold yet because I'm liking the direction in it is heading.
super bullish on that Binance listing after peeping their telegram
BIIINNANNNCE

HUGE BUY ORDERS ON ED!!!

anyone else comfy as fuck?
comfier than comfydo
NULS + HST = Maximum comfyness.
Solid project, easy 3x from here if it gets listed on good exchanges.
I got some free HDG from holding XRL so I rolled it into HST @ 0.0008, not bad.
I have no idea what this is though so I'll just ride it.
End game is just to get more XRL
all in at .00089 and HODLing until it reaches Binance
