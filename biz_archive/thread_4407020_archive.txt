S-should I sell my BTC?
I think 8k is going to be the max
Not yet.
Wait until further confirmation, and then buy BCC.
Also she probably likes BBCs in her ass you cuck
Not a cashtard but I just moved a lot of my BTC to BCC.
The thumbnail looks like a thick as fuck dong is crawling from under her skirt.
Imagine my dissapointment when I expanded the image.
Why would it max at 8k anon
Because it's a ticking timebomb.
Only a matter of time until it's too expensive to move coins off of an exchange to cold storage and back for most investors- then exchanges get hacked/seized and people realize it's stupid to have money that isn't really money, can't be transferred anywhere and is just as prone to regulation and censorship as fiat.
Bitcoin cash will gain ground and businesses actually using Bitcoin as money will switch over to BCH as Bitpay embraces it.
Lol, bch bag hodlers btfo.. the desperation is palpable
 Buy BCH> Being a total retard
