This coin will spike to 400-500% it's value at some point within the next month due to a whale breaking price resistance on Bittrex followed by FOMOing.The BTC value is already bottomed out so it's a zero risk investment.
Meaning as BTC USD goes up the USD value of DOGE will go up the same amount.If you only hold BTC you might as well switch to DOGE.I don't know why i'm helping you autistic retards make money.
do remember that even if it is bottomed out, you need to be able to unload bags to get your money back.
The current volume is 400BTC.Unless you're investing 1.2Mil+ unloading won't be an issue.And FOMOing will cause the volume to at the very least quadruple.
I'm expecting some movement too.
Historically this pumps every few months, let's hope the cycle repeata
