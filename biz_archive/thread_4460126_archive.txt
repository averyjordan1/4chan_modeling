Apart from coin spot what is the best Australian coin-trading website
btcmarkets is ok if you only need to buy btc/eth/ltc.
Coinbase has a big range and v user friendly though
sorry, meant coinSPOT lol
coinjar if you only plan to buy/sell btc/aud
Just buy ETH on BTCmarkets and make accounts on bittrex and binance.
Transfer your eth there and enjoy buying whatever alts you want.
Don't use coinspot, it's shit.
buy on coinspot or independent reserve then trade on cryptopia
I want to buy Loopring.
It dosent have it at coinspot.
coinspot added powr
There aren't any really.
Buy BTC or ETH on BTC markets and send it to a real exchange.
Binance is good
Independent reserve
coin spot1% + trade fees, fuck that senpai.
its 3% fees actually LMAOcoinspot is the ultimate normie exchange.
you cant even put in limit orders HAHA
