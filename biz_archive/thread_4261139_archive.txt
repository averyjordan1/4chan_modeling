Binance coin (BNB) is BUYING BACK and burning HALF of the coins.
This is slowly climbing just like bitconnect did.
Difference is this isnt a ponzi
aww nuuuu so many coins now lol
>muh shitcoin is burning
what shit coin did u put into?
Let me guess you're a LINK faggot?
how much is the premium per coin
bnb is a trading pair now.
I probably wont use it often because its double risk (bnb price and the shitcoin price your trading it for) but still
Its use is very little now because prices for most coins are cheap.
Transfers on Bitcoin get their 50% reduction for literally no cost... and as long as the price is less than 50% of bitcoin it will always be worth to trade bitcoin and any other coin above this coins price.
I guess this makes sense considering who bnb is putting on their site?
