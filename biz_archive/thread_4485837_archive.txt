how do we get the normies as addicted to altcoins as we are
allow convenience stores to sell them prominently displayed behind the front counter with clear signage showing 1h/6h/24h/7d returns
if someone teaches me how to get in the game i will become one of you
Wait for the media to do it.
Probably a year or two off still.
Normies are stupid, thats why Veriaseum and Bitconnect are so huge, they will never understand the concept of Raiden or such anyway.I have no idea and just hope some institutional investors come on boat and make us rich.
register on Binance/Poloniex/Bittrex.>register on Coinbase>sent funds from Coinbase to GDAX>get LTC or ETH >send to one of the exchanges (Binance/Poloniex/Bittrex)>the rest is up to you
When this happens.
Get ready to exit
Early this year when we had the huge bull run, I remember there being tons of youtube videos saying things like "Make $50,000 a month off cryptocurrency!"
with guides on how to trade altcoins.
We need another wave of these to go viral
Too late.Far better to deal in stocks, most people have money there out of necessity.
