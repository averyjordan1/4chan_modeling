Notice that the price of LINK is slowly bleeding?
It's pretty obvious why.
The coin got hyped up to ridiculous levels and then nothing happened.
Day by day a new bagholder wakes up and decides to jump from the ship sinking beneath his feet to safety.
Every day that goes buy the ship is going to sink a little more until finally you and your precious bags DROWN.
This is my last warning linkies.
I've done all I can to save you at this point.
The life raft is right here please, I beg of you, jump on.
you haven't jumped from LINK to ASTRO yet?????
Nice try but I'm not selling my fellow holder
nope!
