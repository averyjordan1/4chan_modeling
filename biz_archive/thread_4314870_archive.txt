so, nobody actually sold that fakeout dump right?
when we still have two more whole days of upside before BCH forks?
FOMO'd and bought 10 bch at 2.5k
i haven't even looked at the markets since I dont really care about this pump at all, but the pump is over when bch reaches about 100k BTC in volumeNothing can sustain that volume.Saw it with eth, xrp, neo, blah blah blah100k is the top
