Look, this shit was fun for the last three days but this is just downright unhealthy and completely unsustainable.
I dont think weve seen a proper mooning like this since ETH is like may or june.WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
Shit wrong picture
It’s flippening
No such coin as bcash
Cash out now and wait a few days.Too much risk ... a lot of shit needs to shake out before any clarity can be had.
Your gains should be protected.
After a few days, when everything is clear and there’s a clear winner, move back in
Going to be the biggest Pump & Dump ever.
Its the real bitcoin dummy.
Its value should be 10k right now.
BUT HOW THE FUCK DO I KNOW IM NOT BASICALLY SELLING ETH FOR $18 IN MAY?!
?THIS SHIT COULD BE GOING TO $400 YOU FUCKING FAGGOTS!!!

Honest to god I'm afraid to leave my computer.
I feel the exact same way.

If it goes to 10k I will cum so hard it will rock the earth.

Number 1 rule: Don't get too greedy.I got greedy holding BTC and lost half of my profits.
Still made some good money but could have made more if I did more research and traded logically.
Smart move.
Never tell GF about your wealth.
Just another excuse to nag for free dinners.
It has even happened with women who aren't my GF!
