B A T B O I Shope you bought the dip
this shit is in a dip for over a month now
I bought at 6k way back and sold when it hit 2k and I'm never looking back.
Thankfully I bought the dip on all the OTHER shit and made all my money back on OTHER coins.fuck bat
It's my heaviest bag.
Down a grand on this shitcoin, but I won't sell at a loss.
i'm in the exact same position.
it was also the very first alt coin i bought, fuck me right?
lol you guys are deluded.
no one is going to use brave - it will never get adoption.
next time this shitcoin has a mini moon mission i'd highly recommend you sell even if its at a loss
no one will use mozilla firefox
it just takes one decent partnership announcement to moon this.
it can happen.
Bought for 12k in June.
Still waiting on gains
