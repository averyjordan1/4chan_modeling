What altcoins should I buy with my $20 worth of BTC?
Nothing, dude.
You'll pay nearly half that just to get it into an exchange.
Then you can buy nothing worth anything.
I personally hold $10 worth of BCN for keks.
I like seeing it on my portfolio, being useless as it is.
Sometimes it hits $8.
Sometimes it hits $12.
A wild ride, that BCN.
