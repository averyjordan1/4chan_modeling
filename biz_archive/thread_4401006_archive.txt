DONT BUY IF YOU DON'T WANT TObut EVX is going to pump very soon.This isn't for you /biz/ kids that buy high.This is one of those good ones to swoop in on.We're talking a good 30% very soon.It's going to be an organic pump too, assuming the retards here don't just start throwing money on it.Just check it out.
What exchange is it on, binance?
I liked the whitepaper.
Binance, yeah.
Sick dank.Sending some money over.Looked at the buy action and you're right.
It is definitely going to pump.
That buy side action and the obligatory sell off as btc started rising.
This is definitely due to pump soon.Further /biz/ bros should sage this to keep the buy high retards out.
This could moon hard without weak hands.
Dude.
This isn't flashy enough for the autists.
This is one for the investors.
lol
Bought this at $2.4 and still holding
Well.
Shit.
Try not to dump.
You should be back into profit relatively soon.
Sell off a small amount of your position at a time.
A good coin, but that's rough.I'm sure you'd have much preferred to buy down here.
Don't worry.
A bunch of smart money is about to start pouring into it soon.
Already have a small amount.
Hope it does because I bought in after the canceled fork news fomo at just a bit under $2 and have been getting justed ever since
why would it pump?
Yeah.
Smart investors are the ones buying this right now, not chasing candles.Buying my position at 0.000196This is the dip you're supposed to buy.
Undervalued and oversold.
