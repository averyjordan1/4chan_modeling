Anons I need advice.
I bought 500 euro's worth of LINK at ATH.I'm at 177$ right now.
I do not expect any big announcement soon so will be holding for a while (got no problem with that) but while holding I can't jump on other coins and make gains/recover.Part of me wants to cut the loss and move on and learn from this stupid mistake but the other part just wants to heal and wait.Help me out.
You guys are alright, dont go to hodl school tomorrow..I will shill you the best pump discord groups I know off....We pump on bittrex, +10k, +5k and +3k members with active channels on trading/rumors and admins who find a good coin to pump and shill.
Last week I made 30% on Bitbean in several trades under 15 minutes and 20% on a Bitbean pump.Join us or stay pajeet faggots!https://discord.gg/K2TBDXqhttps://discord.gg/5v4YgZ2https://discord.gg/mgbp5Bn
hi hi can we have please access to some apis for a demo>yeah sure why not its publicly available information anywaydeluded linkies thinks this means partnerships lmao
It's only 500 mate.
Unless you are starving and can't eat without the money, just hold it.
As soon as you sell, chainlink will moon 100x.
Please do.
I'm good but holding makes one lose other opportunities right and god who knows when link will reach ath again.
Do you literally have no more money to play with?
Lmao
Try to scrape together a little more to invest into something else (that is no where near ATH).
You will be better off than selling LINK at a loss.
sell this shit and buy powr.. you get your money back in a day or 2
hold, get new money from ur parent and buy other coin.
