According to this, the top 5 countries for expatriates packages are:: United Kingdom: Japan: China: Hong Kong: TurkeySource:>https://www.eca-international.com/news/july-2016/the-uk-tops-the-global-list-for-expatriate-packageNow, whilst the UK is 1, I already live there so I would be unable to qualify for that and I've always enjoyed Japanese culture and cuisine.So, does anyone here know about getting a lucrative expatriate package in Japan?
Is it True?No, it's not.
Taiwan is much better.
Twice the fun, half the price.
They speak better English too and the locals are actually friendly to foreigners, not just pretending to be friendly
Go Taiwan he says...
B-but Japan pays more and I work in scientific research, which Taiwan, not meaning any offense, doesn't have a hope when compared to Japan.Citations:: Japan: China: South Korea: Taiwan: Hong Kong>http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?order=ci&ord=descH Index:: Japan: China: South Korea: Hong Kong: Taiwan>http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?order=h&ord=descNumber of Nobel laureates by country:>Japan: 26 laureates>China: 8 laureates>South Korea: 1 laureate>Hong Kong: 1 laureate>Taiwan: 1 laureate>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_countryFields Medallists by country:: Japan: China>N/A: South Korea>N/A: Hong Kong>N/A: Taiwan>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Fields_MedallistsSo no, there is a reason why I specifically asked about Japan and your answer clearly isn't based on the criteria I was seeking.Thank you anyway, but no thank you.
Singapore and Dubai is also cool
Its so difficult to be an expat in Japan that only rich people can do it.
I'm sure if you looked at how other countries treated rich expats the results would be more fair.
