Ok guys, holding Powr @ 5350.
Need sleep for 6hrs.
Keep it in powr or take slight loss and shift it to eth/neo
im also holding POWR since 3400 and i want to marathon OreImo right now, without interference from the outside world, what doi feel like a re-watch of OreImo is worth more than any loss i might experience during the 12 or so hours required to marathon the entire series
...?Am I missing something.
It seems to do be doing pretty well and doesn't show signs of stopping
When PBC hits tomorrow youre going to regret not staying in it
Hold till at least tomorrow.
I think it'll climb until the PBC announcement.
If they really are choosing powr then we rich.
If not itll dip hard but is still a great long hold coin.
4446514IN HOW MANY HOURS IS PBC GOING TO COME?????
?HELP ME OUT I'M BAD WITH TIME ZONESt.
BRAINLET
The regular release is always at 5 pm EST.
I'm assuming they'll keep the same for monday
buy nuls retards
so 30 hours and 20 minutes?nice
So 30 hours if I'm not mistaken.
Hope POWR goes down more I want to accumilate some more, onyl bought 2k at 3300 sats
Mfw i flipped for profit but then fomo'd at a 200 coin lossBought back in at .000051, I'll be alright though .
You failed to understand POWR was actually a very good coin.
You hardly see most ICOs that start with 33 million Marketcap go to 100 million.
POWR has the fundimentals on its side, something like chainlink had hype.
No I know it's a great coin, I've been riding the waves to accumulate, successfully, but I fucked up this morning by panicking back in at a loss.
I prob should just sit back and enjoy the ride
holy fuck buy nuls
