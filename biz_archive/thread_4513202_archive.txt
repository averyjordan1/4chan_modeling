Nice just frooze 100k for 365 days
Is it 20% of what it's worth now or 20% of what it will be worth in 365 days?
You get 20% of the coins.1,000 coins frozen, 200 coins deposited.
You can't touch them though until unfreeze blockheight.
ah, of course
love this coin
With their market positioning and intent to corner smart contracts, they're going to be top 4.
It's a big ask, but realistic.
yeah I have a huge % of my portfolio into this coin, I'm not so worried because I got in at an awesome price, but I don't want to lsoe money that I could have made by just keeping it in BTC
