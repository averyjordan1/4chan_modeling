They will never recover their BTC value.

Latecomers just want to get another eth or btc even if it's impossible
hope............... hope
Learned this the hard way in the past 4 months, with all my long term alts losing 50-80% in BTC.
LINK is more than obvious, but...
yup, your alt might start to moon, sell, because btc is going to shit on it as soon as it rises $100, learned the hard way
Shhh you arent supposed to tell newfags this...
All my Alts are young so they don't have resistance levels.
And I have found the next ethereum and it has never broken out.
what is hindsight?
ask what's the point of longterm>cherrypicks last monthsAre you retarded?
Go look at alts prices 1 year ago, I bought monero at $3
I mean, it doesn't have to be all or nothing... You can invest long enough term to see a good profit.
DESU, there is nothing to say that BTC will not stabloze, meaning that this loss to btc will be minimized.
Hodl till you don't feel right, just try not to sell at a loss
If you buy shit coins... like LINK... then yea

Look at Bitcoin dominance, it was always periodic.Of course alts will recover, and of course eventually BTC share will shrink.By then all the stupid newfags will say :>muh Bitcoin is over muhhhh
The btc bullrun will end at some point anon.
Don't think 900% in a year is the norm.
Its more then possible.
The amount of engagement from the global population is only at .25% If that jumps up to 5% there might be 8 more bitcoins and 40 more eths.
