Is it still possible/profitable to mine doges?
Someone is probably just fucking with this shit only to fuck in the ass everyone falling for it because of memehype
yeah as long as you sell your DOGE during the seasonal pumps.One is starting right now actually, but check the chart histories.
You can see that it pumps really high every 4-6 months or so.
