Is this a pyramid scheme?

BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT!
yes
If you just held the bcc coin(from inception) you would've made over 100,000% returns.
Riddle me that.
The lending platform is not where you will make the best return on your capital, the trick is to hold the bcc coin.
Of course it is not, they have bots that make more profits than those of Golden Nutsachs.
So they need money from basement-dwellers crytotraders for their capital.
Seems legit, rite?
The problem is that the coin will be worth nothing when they exit scam.
What if the owners get doxxed before exit-scamming?
Than they will die for sure.
why would that happen?
