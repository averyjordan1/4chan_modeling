Anyone gonna mention the fact that the Bitcoin bullrun did the double top thing it always does before going into bear market?
i agree with the thought generally but that's hardly a double topalso seems patterns are getting broken as i'd count last month as one of those "double top things", and yet here we are higher still
When will you dummies figure out that we've broken out of the trend you've gotten accustomed to.
Double tops mean nothing in a bull rally.
We going higher soon
i mean a double top on the rsi day chart
