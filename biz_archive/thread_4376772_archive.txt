Transferring ERC 20 tokens on MEW and i'm out of GAS.What do i do guys??
did i not put my gas limit high enough?
i set it at the minimum recommended.You guys told me set 2 GWEI and 200k gas price, but i couldn't set gas price.i set 23000 gwei because it said default 21000 was too low.How do i fix this problem guys?
never mind guys.im legitimately a slow learner.
coins never left my wallet.
Do you have enough ether for gas in your mew?
From my exp.
mew automatically sets a proper gas for your transaction.
yes, i went out of my way to put $10 eth in there.mew just had default 21000, i click generate/execute and it said min needed was 22933 or something, so i put 23000.im going to try 200k gwei, if that fails what should i try?
now its automatically giving me a gas limit.
of 54,000i'm doubling it just incase
its been a while.. how long does it usually take for tokens to transfer?
under a minute for me.
just use 0.1 gwei
