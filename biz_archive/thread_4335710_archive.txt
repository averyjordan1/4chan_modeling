Bitcoin had an extremely strong rejection at 6300 for the second time, going low again, don't miss the chance, buy at low 6000, even if it falls even more you're going to make profits in the long run.
BTC is acting in line with how the market is behaving on BCH dummy
yep this is BCH's market now
where should all the New money be coming from to push it to the moon Mr einstein?
From the same exact place as before, your wallets.
Its going below 6
Hard to tell, most of the traders which speculated the fall to 4900s now believe it's going to fall to 5600 and then stabilise.
Take that information for what you want.Bitcoin usually moves slowly, even during this BCH fiasco exchanges were behaving very lazy.
If there's going to be a huge change, it's going to be visible from a mile.
OP is smart and speaks the truth
