is it too late to buy NEO?I know some people have a hard time trusting the chinks but f the Chinese governement relax restrictions on cryptos I can see this properly mooning to a similar price as etheri also like that it pays you GASi think the chinese governement will buy into this and not let it failthoughts?
It's never too late to buy neo but for real gas is undervalued.
The PBC call for a while ago that buying any under 30 USD is a good deal still holds.
It's a pump a dump, Hong Fei is talking in a conference and price spikes?
Vitalik and bunch of other devs are constantly presenting and the cost of the coin doesn't increase because it's just a presentation.
No news or nothing.
China has banned all of crypto and especially ICOs and it's not planning to lift them so why the price increase?
Onchain has connection with state government officials not nationwide.
I love how you fuckers are trying to pump itâ€™s price for the weekend.
You fucks operate on a rigid work schedule
