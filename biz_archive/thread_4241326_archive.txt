4241621You were warned.
It's so fucking annoying how everyone calls $7500 a bubble.
How is a number like 7500 even relevant?
What if there were 21,000,000,000 bitcoins and it was $7.50?
people would say shit about over valued bubble.It's going to take some adjustment for people to understand how few bitcoins there are and how few people will ever own one.
BTC is going to $1,000,000, these tiny jumps are people just having trouble coming to terms with the insane return rate.
They've been calling bubble since $5.
Ignore (((them))).
you are right.bitcoin at 1 million bucks is nothing when you realize that supplynot even covers 0.25% of worlds population and just 25% of the 1%.

Whatâ€™s the ceiling before the fork?
Not sure when to sell some of my stack.
Some of my info says 12K, some 14K To be safe, I am dumping some at $1187, and keeping the rest in for S2X.
What I dump at 1187, I will buy back in with post fork at 6790
* I've been up for 3 days on the phone with a lot of contacts so I could let you all know the precise instant Bitcoin broke out.
$7330 and climbing.

I just knew.
I don't know how else to explain it.
I's been that way since I was flatlined for 38 minutes in '78.
I just "know" things.
That is why I worked as an Investigator for so long.
Anyway, whatever.

technical analysis alone didn't seem to be working for you kids, so I thought I might lend a hand.
Just fucking with you, Kid.
Nothing personal.
I knew that bullshit would get a rise out of someone.
Just trying to lighten the mood for those poor souls who didn't listen.
Keep on MAGA.
>mfw altfags are so fucking triggered over the last few months that they actively want BTC to fail nowstay mad you fucking brainlet vermin
Well, according to my sources, some high level Altys initiated a very expensive highly co-ordinated attack against Bitcoin several days ago.
They Shorted Bitcoin, then rented several thousand servers at Amazon to pose as "Miners".
They also paid some Redditors / youtubers to fud bitcoin.
two of the main ones go by the name "Teeka" and "Tone Deaf" (Names slightly altered for obvious reasons.)
The also generated an "open letter" to support the scam.
This was all funded by Prince "All Weedy", who has since been arrested, and his 20 billion in assets seized.
I knew the funding for this scam was drying up, and that Bitcoin was set to rebound ferociously like a coiled spring.
I picked the double bottom as the point for the return from this Global Bitcoin Fud Scam.
this main scam included many variants, so that when one scam was outed, they would just switch to the next one.
many of these promoted Bitcoin Cash as "The Real Bitcoin".
At the height of the Operation these Bitcoin fud scam threads were appearing on /biz/ at the rate of one every 30 seconds.
27 is dubs to me!!
Holy shit I heard about this!!
Just takes to a buddy about it.
Oldfag confirms!
This.In the future BTC holders will be akin the feudal lords.
Every BTC will be worth an entire estate.
The BTC nobility will displace the old.
Just so you know, there will be a massive dump at 100K, but, as always, we will buy back, and it will rise once again.
Does anyone have a list of all the exchanges giving out BT2 to everyone holding BTC?
Since the Intelligence Asset I am currently allocated to is near Seattle, I use Bittrex / Coinbase.
