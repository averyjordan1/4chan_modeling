I know it is hard when you loose money, especially if you worked hard for it, one month ago i had about 5 BTC and during all that fork shit i made lots of baaaad trades and ended up with about 0.10BTC.
But hey, i invested and knew the risk and the possible potential.
Now i recovered with day trades and controlling my emotions to 0.45Btc within a week.
So this whole game is so volatile, you can still make it, stop crying over losses, its your own fault and only you can recover from it.
Learn from your failures and bring yourself under control,,,
i love willy wonka
