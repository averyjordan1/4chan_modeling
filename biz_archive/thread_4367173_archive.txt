aeternity.comAeternity claims to provide decentralized oracles too>inb4 noLINKer

I'm sure they do.
But it's also vaporware and they don't have the connections or again a working product.
I would love to see the documentation on these decentralized oracles as well.
It only works for the Aeternity blockchain which means it only works seamlessly for smart contracts built on top of Aeternity.LINK works for Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin blockchains.
So Aeternity's true competitors are Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Rootstock.
Do you really think Aeternity can compete with these three?Plus doing building a decentralized oracle is hard enough as is, they're trying to build a decentralized oracle + ethereum + more features.
You fags are saying LINK is a long term hold?
This is even a longer hold.

nobody wants to be forced to use whatever the fuck aeternity is to get decentralized oracles.
stay dumb, no linker
well, don't you need link to use their oracles as well?
LINK works for Hyperledger, Ethereum, and Bitcoin blockchains.
