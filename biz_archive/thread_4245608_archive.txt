Sir if you have spare money, you should consider gambling it full-tilt.
Crypto Cobain's Cryptowealth Pyramid dictates that you should dedicate a small portion of your portfolio to this kind of shit.
It helps keep you feeling in control and away from panicking on other things, and who knows sirs, you could just get the big short (don't even fucking try!)
https://www.bitmex.com/register/eY1A09Link is good for reduced trading fees for 6 months & I'm all ears for any questions or tips and tricks with how to use the platform and what exactly they trade.
Pic related it's the CRYPTOWEALTH PYRAMID
