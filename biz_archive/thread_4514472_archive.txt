Guys I tried to buy an ERC20 token from my FUCKING COINBASE.
How fucked am I?
How can I get my monies, or is my cucumber a pickle?
sorry, what did u do exactly?
I participated in a presale (EDO) and I sent ETH from my Coinbase, so the smart contract sent the tokens to a Coinbase address which I have no access to.
I checked Etherscan, the coins are there, just sitting lonely>like you desu
You're fucked you idiot.
Both coinbase and every ICO I've ever seen directly warns against this, what made you think it was a good idea?
I was just going through my good idea check list.-participate in ICO with Coinbase-sleep with a girl from Craigslist-buy Link-etc
CB will not retrieve your coins.Did you even read their policies?Of course you didn't because you are posting here looking for an answer instead of looking it up yourself
such is life
It's posts like this that get me through the day
