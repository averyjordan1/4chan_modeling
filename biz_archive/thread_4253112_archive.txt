if you were part of the pumping from 4000 to 7800 in the past weeks, you deserve nothing worse than a painful and slow death.Now that segwit has been cancelled and the majority of pumpers wanted free money, which is why they risked to buy at 5000+, it will crash and burn for a long time even more than pumping.
You have been warned.
>inb4 it was le $X memei am not saying the crash will last forever, but every fucking idiot that bought in specially at 6500+ will probably kys soon when it bitcoin crashes.
I have predicted this on my TA'shope you all sell your baggs soon
They are not as JUSTed as the Seg2x futures buyers though.
