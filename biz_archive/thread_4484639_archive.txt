i know you guys all think it's fud, but if it's not, would all exchanges that have usdt ties be affected (ie bittrex)?
or would the usdt exchanges just spike in price?
just wondering if anyone other than bitfinex is in jeopardy of going illiquid, not really worried about coin prices
It's not all FUD, but it probably won't have much impact.
$30MM isn't much money, and your average bitcoin investor these days doesn't know or care about any of fundamentals or inner workings of crypto
