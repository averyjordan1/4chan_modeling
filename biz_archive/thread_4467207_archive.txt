We'll see bitcoin being called racist in a few years.
Already happenedhttps://thinkprogress.org/bitcoin-by-the-privileged-for-the-privileged-113ea4afcc66/#>Why does Bitcoin specifically have this demographic makeup?
Well, there’s a fair amount of privilege built directly into the currency: In order to buy the sometimes wildly expensive currency, Bitcoin users need to be wealthy.
And they can afford to put their wealth into a currency that isn’t widely accepted or even recognized.
Plus, they move easily through the financial and digital space—the process of “mining” bitcoins demands it; it is all about knowing coding and decryption and how to use an exchange.
The sum total of these things—advanced knowledge of computer science, wealth—are also markings of the young, white male.
