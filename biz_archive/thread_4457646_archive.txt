don't drink so much, a little is fine but it seriously blurs your reason if you have too much.
On the plus side you'll probably have brass balls and go for the really risky moves that have a slim chance of paying off huge.
When you live drunk you have a 90% chance of failure but a 10% chance of stupid success.
