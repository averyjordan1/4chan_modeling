It will keep pumping 50k up per month.

Will Ether please pump so I can have my bitcoin back?
anon btc still doesnt have a use casebut meh just tell yourself its a store of wealth or whatever
The thing about bitcoin is that it needs to have a real use in the future.
Otherwise it will eventually capitulate when people want to sell it for something they can use.
I know you can use bitcoin for shit.
But right now it's still a meme.
Most people aren't spending something that they expect to increase in value.
Bitcoin will still hit 25k before this happens.

let's zoom out a bit...three years it took to reach that same ATH.
most people on this board get suicidal when something doesn't moon within a week, three years would be eons for them.that's why i sold half my stack already.
$10k is going to be the same as $1k back then.
