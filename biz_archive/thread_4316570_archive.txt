Thanks JUSTer
I don't have one..I just never got into, I was always going to, I always planned to.
I was going to buy BTC when it was a few dollars, then when it was a few hundred dollars, but I never got to it.I got a kid, and all money went into raising her right and all of it goes to that, and it's not hard in todays society.
My life is turning bad, and my country is going even worse, and I'm out of options.
All I can do is ask and be humble.This is my BTC wallet1AfBU2wQ1Gr96GFrTtcve5CU9UWgmcJthdAnd anything would help, and if you help, know that it wouldn't help me, but it would help my little girl get the life she deserves in terms of money, because right now all I can give her is the love she deserves, which in todays society isn't enough if I want a good life for her.
BTC WALLET REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Thanks for the JUST anon!
fuck PBCglorified PND group
I profited off digibyte's pump and dump.
I deleted my ETH in a paranoid state after a period of sleep deprived margin gambling.
I lost money shorting bitcoin's unnatural rise to 7.8k but if I had just been patient, used less margin, and added to my position conservatively, I would be living it up right now.
