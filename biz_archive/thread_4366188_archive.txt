I spend a lot of hours per day reading and trying trading strategies, reading about projects and so on(no "solid team shit" but from hype perspective) but I have no one except you guys to share all my info and fun times with.I have been on a steady trading climb since last year or so(easy to say in bull market of course, but learn to risk handle and walk away when you get stopped out) but now it's the only thing I think of and how to make more money(up 20x this year)
i got one of my close friends into it.
feels comfy discussing cryptos and making gains
4366188How do u trade crypto?
I'm holder that makes gains, but crypto seems chaotic it just goes up.
And down almost randomly,except some news like forks
Iâ€™m the only one I know when it comes to a lot of things about me
What other things anon?I feel like a lot of us here have things in common
I mostly try to trade uptrending things, following things like https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/020905.asp so you have a upgoing range of higher highs and lows, then you can place buys in those dips and so on.
The most important thing ever is to never open a position of more then let's say 5% of your BTC holdings, and have a stop loss and NOT RE ENTER if you get stopped out.So many people have good eye for entries and projecs hype, but risk taking and money management is where they fail.Also remember it's not about being right vs wrong the most times, it's about the result(gain in % ) when being right that counts
