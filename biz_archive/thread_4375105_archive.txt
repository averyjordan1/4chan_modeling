Obvious one would be>Put your live savings in BTC once you turn 18Other than that>Go to uni because you like the future job, not because you like the studiesI was a kid back then, so I wasn't depressed and didn't care about girls.

>all these people forgetting about mt goxSay goodbye to all your BTC you worked so hard for lmao

Nope, buying 10k bitcoin and not selling until now would have zero effect.
If you want to crash bitcoin>start mining same day as Satoshi releases btc>gather 500k btc>monopolize bitcoin mining>btc is now worth 2usd>digibyte 10k

Doubt I'll remember it seven years later though.So maybe MsgFrmFuture:BuyAMZNStock:$1136by2017Also exactly 37 characters.
If it was only a few years later I wouldn't have to waste characters on making sure 7 year old me knew what AMZN meant and what was going on here, and by ~2010 I'd established a time travel password to use in cases such as this.

My godYou people wouldn't alter your past even with a full book to send yourselfDo you really think you would take a message saying "I'm you from the future, trust me" seriously ?
Unless you're stupid, you would need a little more than thatTell yourself something only you are supposed to knowOtherwise it's just

The Big Boys are trying to get out of the market late at night without losing their ass and causing a panic.
That's is why the market is opening down everyday.
They are trading during extended hours when Joe Blow has no chance.
Then when the market opens it just bounces around for a while and gives the image of sideways trading and small losses.
This thing is crashing.
Soros is out.

message talks about fucking Bitcoin in 2002>takes like 8 years before it even pops up>not buying like 10k super cheap just to be safeIf you're retarded it's your own fault anon.
If I got a message telling me about something that only came into existence 8 years later, I'd at least throw a little money at it just in case.
Python, back propagation, buy bitcoin
but why do you need fucking bitcoin if you can get powerball numbers
4377400
It's not about being super cheapIt's about remembering itWould you keep a random sms in mind for 8 years ?
You wouldn't even remember you heard about bitcoin 8 years ago
Powerball is a CIA project to catch time travelers.
Bitcoin $7000, Ethereum $300 in 2017.
TELL MOM AND DAD.
hello fellow warshingtonian

Id be worried about government questioning.
Plus, I would rather get rich by investing shit.
People would respect me a little more rather rather than think im just a lucky faggot who won the lottery.

Buy BTC and don't fucking waste them on drugs , CP and bullshit.
Why are all you retards focusing on bitcoin when the lottery exists?This is 2002.
It will be 7 FUCKING YEARS until bitcoin even exists.
Your 2002-self will pass the message off as spam and forget about it by the time he's able to buy.
Even if he's autistic and remembers he's most likely a poorfag who will buy $37 worth and think he's doing his future - self proud...I would message:NYpwrball:11/17:222222222211/24 3333333333Schedule the drawing such that your 2002-self can verify the first drawing was a winner in a couple days and play the 2nd drawing a week later when he realizes this message is special.
I would have only bought 50kAnd exploited parity to get even richer
mine 20k bitcoin, sell@7k$ oct 2017
kek good one this is what would most likely happen as well
