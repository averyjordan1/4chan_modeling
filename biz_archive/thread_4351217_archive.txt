>Price of 0.1Oh boy now your losses just have to increase by another 85% from where they are before the pump!
this is part of the reason why I'm so /comfy/ holding cash.
on top of investing in satoshi's vision, I also receive the backing of Roger "Demolition Man" Ver and Jihadi Jihan to secure my investment
smocze is that you
No more pumps.
This is a desperate attempt to hold price up so Jihan can mine at a profit.
They will dump the fuck out of this coin before Coinbase releases the 2 million coins it's holding
Lol if the support is at 0.1 we're doomed
You fucking idiots, they're not gonna buy higher... if they were gonna buy they would just buy instead of warning ahead of time so they get a worse price.
They're manipulating you.
