I have a good feeling about this coin.
Feels actually legit low cap project with solid team.>Max supply only 629610 INXT>Market cap only around 1.5MM>Young devs with already impressive backgrounds (https://internxt.io/team)>Ambitious goals where the first goal is CLOUD X (https://internxt.io/cloud)>Founder and Adviser nominated for Forbes 30 under 30 in 2018>Team is very active on twitter (https://twitter.com/internxt_io)>Decent whitepaper (https://internxt.io/whitepaper.pdf)>Alpha will be released with all its core infrastructure code in January>Bigger exhanges coming soonYou can't even lose anything when this is capped so low already.So /biz/, what are we waiting for?
ATH to buy as usually?
lol I remembr this coin.
Made a few bucks off it when it went to 75k sats.
I would consider rebuying then
