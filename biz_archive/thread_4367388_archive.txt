you are saying this like its a bad thing
you put a link to reddit instead of the fucking website for the coinwhat does the token do?
is this for real?
It seemed like a really good platform until pic related.This will fuck it over.
50% of gains and 0% of losses will be distributed to the decentralized aggregate that is fund managers and token holders.
That's such a raw deal for investors, holy fuck.
Why wouldn't potential investors be triggered by this?This is such an appeal to the greed of token buyers at the expense of the supposed clients of the service that I'm wondering if this isn't just a scam cashgrab.No one in their right mind would think this is a good idea.
igniteratings.comreddit explains it, mate
So ignite is a good deal ?Team seems strong I like it.
what you talking about fag, successful active token holders are rewarded same as passive token holders
Don't be ridiculous.
Just buy some Monaco.
