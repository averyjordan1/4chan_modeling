g̶u̶y̶s̶ goys
Just move like .0shekels
i want to move 20k tokens, how much will this cost?
>using jewthereum for transaction>not using the best most known decentralized crypto>not waiting for an hour and paying 5$ for the smallest transaction
im selling alt coins from an ico not yet listed on an exchange.I have 0 eth... i have about $20 in BTC.
someone wants to buy the coins and pay in BTC.I am trying to work out if i have enough btc to transfer to an exchange, exchange for eth, transfer to mew so i can sell this alt coin.
i've never made a fucking transaction with eth before.
isn't it obvious... GAS PRICE, i need to know gas price or a calculator
asdfghjkl;'
always keep like 0.02 eth in there minimum and you're fine
What’s your address?
I’ll send you 20 cents
It literally costs about 1-5 cents for ethereum transactions.
No matter how many tokens pretty much.
Set the gas to 200k and the gas price to 2 gwei
