stop the shilling pajeets
Hello newfag.
It seems you forgot that coin has been shilled since antshares days.
But no, you ignore coins that are consistently shilled by multiple people in biz in the spant of months.>I hate coins that are shilled too much and have genuine hype>I hate this NEO shit and LINK shitYet you buy into rarely shilled coins like NULS lmao.
buy Neo.
Very big things soon.
so excited.

Link is different, it only have 2 devs lol
TruthLink is literally a fat russian and an emo guy
Literally my first time on this board and it just seems like it's people who were late getting in to crypto trying to convince others to buy in to inflate it higher so they can sell out, leaving the people who joined even later holding the bag so now their only option is to preach about crypto so the newcomers inflate it so they can cash out.
Leaving even more people who came too late.
If there was a way to reliably short BTC I sure as fuck would because this bubble is going to pop soon.

Dont buy in if you dont want to.
Just stop complaining about the shilling.
This board is good for one thing: sentiment analysis.
These shill threads give an idea about what people are excited about, and since we have no fundamentals to analyze and TA is voodoo, this is all we've got.
If the shill threads stop this whole board will become completely useless.
This.
ETH 2.0 but more potential and less pedo
Mad you missed out on NULS?
One belt, one road, motherfucka
