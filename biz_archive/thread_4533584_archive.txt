What's up w/ this coin?
Pretty low circulating supply and max supply.
Currently like 1/3rd or less than the all time high.
Does this have a chance to moon?
Team is being real shady right now.
Investors losing trust.
Alot of competitors too
I was able to catch a sell on that spike that happened on the 20th.
The day chart looks great, which is why I got in earlier.
I just moved VTC into MTL a little while ago, and I'm hoping that I can catch the MTL gain in time to move it back into VTC.
That day the chart was great because someone said that MTL was the Palm Beach Confidential pick.It wasn't and dropped as usual.They will sponsor the Necker Cup in few days but who cares, I'm losing trust in MTL too after that issue with the investor that already dumped his stack.
This.Their reputation has been tarnished, they need to rebrand.
I'm talking about the entire life of the coin.
It completed a full market cycle, so very large gains could occur.
I think MTL has good potential.
Sure, the alpha was way overhyped but their project is coming along much quicker than many other coins on the market.
I've been slowly buying in between 4 - 6 dollars and will most likely hold until mid next year.
I really don't expect much to happen with this coin until they have a finished project which is being used by merchants
Seriously, that chart looks very promising.
Everyone keeps saying buy low and sell high so I'm going to take my chances with MTL lol.
Hopefully we can see a modest 2x soon.
oops, I meant finished product not project.
you may not be far offm.tl
Unrelated, but I'd also check out the PTOY charts.
It's similar.
Pretty low supply and already mooned a couple times and has been cruising at all time lows for a couple months now.
I think holding that and setting a sell order would be worthwhile.
