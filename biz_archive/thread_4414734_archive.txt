Lets see em, dont be shy

Down from 2k somehow.
Bought astro to get a fresh start, im already bagholding
Happy to see a proper BTC hodl portfolio.
Looking at those threads one might think nobody is holding BTC anymore, just shitcoins.
And I love the 35k DOGE.
Sorry mang, you don't get chad-like gains from holding ye olde bitcoin.
I know, the smart guys got into LINK I heard.
I have around 0.42 btc.
:(Am I gonna make it?
:(
Are you LARPing or did you actually go all in on Funfair?
It's real.
I put it all on red.
We'll see how it goes...
you'll have enough for several lambos in 2155
Walk into dealership>I think I'd like to take that Camry for a spin.
It looks like a sensible vehicle>"Sure," says the salesman, looking you up and down.
He's hesitant to deal with this hoodie-wearing young kid.
"But you'll have to put a down payment of 2 sats down... this is a 10 sat car.
">"No problem," says Anon.
"Actually, how much is that Lambo over there?
">"100 sats," says the salesman, chuckling.>"I'll take it."
I have 3300 ARK and .25 BTC.
Am I fucked?
Alts
This blows.
I wonder if 2018 is going to be the real trial by fire, nuking all of the truly shitty alts and leaving only a few good ones.
Or perhaps it'll kill all of them.
miss eth ??
Thanks.
Mid last weekend I had 2.78 BTC and 2.78 BTG (only got into crypto in September).
I really wanted BCH so I could hodl all the forks.
I was looking at charts and realized that it was going to moon so I bought 10 BCH and then some more.
I made epic gains.
Then I lost most of them with some very shit moves.
Outcome is ok though, I have more BTC, the same BTG, 2.7 BCH and small stakes in alts.
Not going to gamble any more.
This will be easily 200-300k in a few years.
Then I will sell 75% and buy a much nicer home for my family (current one was 300k).
Still a bit sad about being asleep during the moon but whatever..
Oh and DOGE is the best.
It's stable as fuck.
If I ever catch another moon I might put some of the gains into doge.
I can't wait to be JUSTed by fingox 2.0 and get wiped clean.
I should have held more bitcoin.
Was busy these last couple weeks and didn't take the time to trade ETH for bitcoin when it dipped below 6000.
Dollar value is holding up well though.
what's your net worth outside of crypto?
backstory?
were you just well to do / invested early on?
etc.Sincerely curiousI assume you're LARPing though>holding 1M tetherfuck
Outside of crypto I'm worth 100k.
I got into crypto because of a mildly lucrative online business (no longer operating) and just kept the crypto to avoid (((taxes))).
Got in around 400$.I post in a blockfolio thread from time to time just to stroke my epeen.
If you lurk here regularly you will see me post again so I assure you it's real and I'm a complete madman for holding 1m (((teachers))).
Outside of crypto I'm worth 100kYou really need to diversify, dude.
If you're not LARPing I'm sure you've heard this a thousand times.
But honestly there's no harm in pulling out a relatively small % and socking it away in property/vanguard/whateverThen again maybe I'm wrong and you'll be one of the new billionaires in a year or two and my advice would have cost you half a bil or something
That's why I have such a large amount of usdt, I fell for the bch FUD and decided to cash out some precious geepee on finex, now just waiting on my "one-time withdrawal"
how's USDT->USD withdrawal work?
how long will you have to wait?
M tethersBallsy move man.props on getting in real early.
The IRS is coming they are already tracking BTC address, if you want to avoid taxes go full privacy coins
My usdt balance is just my finex usd balance and polo/bittrex usdt.
I just deposit everything to finex and request a USD withdrawal like normal, that's it.
So how much of that 1 mil are you planning on pulling out of crypto?
I don't plan on breaking the law m8.
Uncle Sam is love Uncle Sam is life.
I just got into Crypto last month - I have 1.01 ETH to my name, what would you suggest I do to get where you are in a year?
Any tips to help, I keep hearing ARK and BQX but I'm hesitant about them but know if I don't make a move I'll regret it.ETH Address for Proofs:0x6693c336AedC0D84DEa7FfD1C15AF3afEe967C89
sent you 5 eth
lol thx if you did I am the kind of person to pay you back - so please leave some way to contact, but I'm seriously asking if you had the feeling about ETH enough to make it there, what would you say about ARK or BQX or is there a different coin I should look into besides that?
please help me too i am poor wojak whose sister ate my brother and i have 0.5 ether0xf5968Fc12d0ADd6175ba0a8C0e6db0A32b4B9DA1

thanks  wat is good buy
funfair
I’m going all the way with OMG if I crash and burn in the flames so be it.
Rate me, am I retarded or will I make it?
thanks i go anal in
Just bought 7k of it.
Where do you think the price is going in the next few months?
buy req
I think it'll stagnate for a while and it could go as low as 100 sats, no clue what that'll be in USD terms, maybe 1.1 cents at the low.
Worst case scenario, though.
But I see it hitting 10 cents Feb, MarchA lot depends on BTC price
0xb528574975E22bFC89aa7f526a1Bed7354C5C311 help a pajeet out
you know nobody is giving away ETH for free, it would be a miracle if it happened.
But these guys have obviously made it to where I want to be so I'm not asking for Fish I'm asking to be taught how to Fish.
I don't want to invest 2G and be sitting with massive losses from BIZ threads shilling LINK, but companies like ARK and BQX are promising to me, just want some advice from experienced Coiners.
Am I too late for the party?0x8e2ca3b0cc68ce7b53abb62f7d13d5d0cd5f24a8
Both, really.
Just started mining ETH with my first pc build.
Some help?

Just hodl BTC
this is my current portfolio Mostly 60%BQXARK35%ETH/ETC5%POWR Should I just move out of ARK into BQX, or vice versa out of BQX into ARK, or am I missing another coin like NEO for example?
I just invested for some fun and to amuse myself with /biz/ but now I'm looking to become a blockchain developer or at least a solidarity dev for contracts.
If you gift me anything it would go towards writing contracts on ethereum mainnet and ethereum classic.
I'll post about it in the future even if no donation.0x8a29f311eaB8133441D689204E65e1df6b9eDaCC
I’ll take it.
Going to add to my stack till I hit 500
Whoops cropped my SALT holdings.
just 14 SALT.
I'm working up to having 1BTC in my wallet at all times.
I want to get to where I have at least 10ETH and 1BTC and trade off 5G, but I am not investing anymore than the 1,500 I started with.
I'm around 200+ but that could change over night.
I'm hodling 1k DigiByte.
How bad am I doing?
0.02 btc worth portfolio>diversifies into 16quadrillion coins
Same idea about OMG here, muh fellow God.
Does everyone hate FunFair or what
Nobody knows what it is because they're b2b and do no marketing.
I put in on things I want to use, I'm not really a trader.
More of an aspiring fintech guy.
lol
Today is JUST also rate plsWill I make it?
what is with you people holding all of these meme coins?do you just buy things that get shilled on /biz/?
k ?
How did you manage to do that??
I AM THE DIGI-VANGUARD!I AM NEVER EVER SELLING!
I put in on things I want to use>DOGE
Spare .2 omg mister shark?0x8ce3c2cbd2df0ec659d892b8e038b526472f9bd8Also, how long have you been holding?
I got in back in August when the price was sub $6 and have been holding ever since.
My one regret was not sellling a portion of my stack when it hit $13 at the time I was worried about missing a Neo level blast off.
Yes, definetly yes
Poorfag student so this is all I have Wat do lads?
Got £900 sitting in the bank to spare
Ayy lmao this is going to be 200k next week

Down but not out.
poor>has £3200 in crypto + 900 to spare
ur missing ASTROsafest bet out of all the shitcoins and grossly undervalued as far as that goesBTCETHXMRASTRO
Breddy much
Yeah, some guys were shilling it here for a while.
The Discord is full of losers.
One guy on there has already lost 400 grand in crypto.
Haha, I got that by shitposting in chancoin threads,
The Discord is full of losersYeah, no shit.
The Telegram is even worse.
The problem is that the devs have banned a bunch of people and stifled pretty much any silliness.
It's just a corporate cock sucking fest in there.
You either say good things or you get sent to reeducation camp.Oh well, I'm still going to trade it, but their channels are a waste of time.
Like I said, here to have fun, learn about the technology and get involved in the technology, if I gotta shitpost for chans to get some etc or eth for contracts, then so be.
(heres an extra (you))
Noice!!!
Good lord, everything below BTG is pure garbage.
Yes I'm still a poorfag.
Should I buy some LINK/REQ?
nofunallowed.jpg
LINK isn't going anywhere fast, buy into BTC/LTC/ETH and use those gains to feed into LINK later on
Digibyte going to be 100$ by christmas.pic related.
Noob here, all in astro at .008, shouldn't have bought all at once I guess.
Not selling yet though
I've been incrementally joining, my cost average is at .0078 right now so we're in good company (except I have 10x as much ASTRO as you)Volume has been dry for now, somebody sold to an order at .0035 :( while my order was at .0045... retardsStill trying to bring my cost average down but I expect this coin to be at 3$-10$ in the next month

that's a proper fucking portfolio right there
Lisk is rebranding soon-ish, so the price for it will increase again.
The current spike was just based on hype.
jeez boi, u'll get millionaire with that shift bag soon
Just started, speculation is fun.
in bed with banks and american express>market cap not even $10b>garbage
LINKWon't be fun much longer.
shift is highly undervalued... its almost back to where it was before the big pump and dump11million total supplyjust over $1 eachprobably reached its bottom by now, if not, really closethink if you could buy like 20k of them, at $1 each, and weeks later they were like $5 each...fuckin a, man
jesus christ kid
You believe in KNC?
Cause shit about to get real?
well, atleast ur neo is gonna moon 3x soon

All in on HST.Christmas gonna be goood this year.
Cant do anything but laugh at portfolios without DGB
tfw bought in at 30 centsgonna kys myself
 Bought astro to get a fresh start, im already bagholdingwhy would you sell whatever shit you had if you're down to 140 anyway?and wtf did you buy?and wtf is astro?you can make good money with great crypto projects.
you will lose a lot of money if you keep putting your money in shit projects
I'm gonna be real happy with my FCT investment aaany day now.
Alts hurt

blockfolio LARP
Am I doing this right?
P-please tell me it's fine
SIGTtf u doin nibba
108 KNCIM GOOOOOOOING TO MAKE IT
It looks off because I put in 7 ether on my chart, but I ended up not buying it yet.
Not bad
meaning to buy NEO for a while, will wait for the dip and hop on i think.
thoughts?good, sensible choices.
Don't worry anon, HST is very likely to hit $1 by EOY.
Considering that I bought between 5 and 6K I would think so.
I regret not taking the time to get in earlier.
Also, how to get the dark themed blockfolio?I've already updated the app but I see no option to change the theme.
any recommendations what else might be sensible choices?
More ETH?
and I would watch NEO for a bit as well.
It has a dark theme in Android.
Are you on iOS?
No, I'm in Android as well.
But there's only the option to change the chart theme; no option to change the whole blockfolio theme.Help?
App version?
I'm 1.1.4.
Google Play store has staggered releases sometimes, I got the update yesterday.
$0 - $1000: 1789 days$1000- $2000: 1271 days$2000- $3000: 23 days$3000- $4000: 62 days$4000- $5000: 61 days$5000- $6000: 8 days$6000- $7000: 13 days$7000- $8000: 14 days>no chad gainz from holding btcAnon....
App version 1.0.21.No option to update on Google Play.
Is it because my phone is old af?
Poor guy with the 59.26 Ark fucking up the perfect balance.
I'll pick them off from you so you dont look as goofyAVBrSw2sFxik7ejy9Hs3ALoUEMYXgsaN8cNo need to thank me i'm just like thatI'd pick up the 116.10 Shift and 15.36 LSK but I'm not THAT nice, unless you ask smoothly mbe.
i'm no expert but imo sensible short-medium term choices - btc/bch, eth, neo, ltcbitcoin is boss for now.
need to see what news comes out though
sent you 5 ethNo you didn't you faggot.
The blockchain is public you fucking retard.https://etherscan.io/address/0x6693c336aedc0d84dea7ffd1c15af3afee967c89
ZRX is going to come to coinbase.
Most undervalued ERC20 out there
tfw someone puts through a 0.00 order at a high price and Blockfolio shits itselfI've had many nights where I contemplate what life would really be like if my shitcoin bags were worth 5 MM overnight
You're holding long term or what?Just asking because a crypto channel (cryptobeak) on youtube recommends it as its favorite long term shitcoin.
Might look into it.
...make me rich please
top kek
goddamn I'm poor
Can someone give me 100$ if i proof how poor i am?
I will pray for this human being.
Yeah genuinly curious as well.
Just bought btc during the dip but I only plan to make a market weighted portfolio of top 10 coins, namely btc, bch, eth, xrp and xmr.
ur gonna make it
THERE GOES THE WAGEKEK MONEY
Oops it includes my nameOh well who cares
Are you the insect man?
I’ve made multiple bad investment decisions, tempted to throw down more money and try swing trade but knowing me i’d fuck that up as well.
dousent look to badseems okdousent look that bad lad, we all make mistakes>tfw bought link at 5k sats before btc rallyreally belive in substratum and ark as far as alts go though
