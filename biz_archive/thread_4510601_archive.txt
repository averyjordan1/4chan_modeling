they also track you.
not sure what youre getting at.
4510639You have no idea about their financial situation, do you?
This shit is more overvalued than shitcoins in crypto.

Well for starters it knows when you had a potential accident and contacts you straight away.
They can also deactivate your car remotely which is starting to become John deere kind of jewery.Also fuck them for artificially limiting the mileage of their cars unless you'll pay 10k more.
what?
overvalued?
theyre bringing important products to people that have more money than you.

"Important" products?
Electro Cars?
How is the energy produced?
Check out Konstantinos Boulouchous, he is Professor in ZÃ¼rich and explains why electro cars are a joke, when you understand how energy is produced right now.And what else is Tesla doing?
Oh yeah getting millions of subsidies and wasting it like shit.
Im an engineer faggotWho gives a shit that every powerhouse is a big boiler.
Electric cars need to maintenance.
They already have industrial uses.
In Syberia trucks have electric motors.
Tesla's dragged us into electric cars, and SpaceX is dragging us back to the stars.

Stop posting this nerd car.

It burns ancient dinosaur blood, is draped in baby cow skins, and produces a glorious noise.
Got myself a 98 this year.
I feel so damn good about it.
It's comfy as a blanket.
not understanding that nissan is the best of all ricers.
Even if there were in 15 years (which they won't be) then that Roadster 2 is going to be worth even more and would make an incredible investment.
As a poorfag, I'd be ok with a GT86 or a cute MX-5.
Haha...ha...ha250 top speed, 0-60 in 1.9
Biz wants a lambo because its badge is literally a bull
"Important" products?
Electro Cars?
How is the energy produced?Primarily from domestic coal and natural gas instead of oil from a bunch of sandniggers.
Going fast in a straight line means nothing.
The Ring is the only metric for car performance that matters.
Cosworth GT86, all I'm saying
Why supercharger over turbo?
