s o c i a l m e d i a m a r k e t i n gSeriously, it is the most efficient and cheap and effective way to advertise products, blogs, businesses, etc.It is also either first or second fastest growing industry in America, because of how Capitalist we are as a society.So use all the social media websites, and use cheap targeted ads directly at your target audience.
I.e.
selling yoga mats?
Target 18-34 urban women interested in health.
