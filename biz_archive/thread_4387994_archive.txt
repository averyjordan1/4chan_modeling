Bitcoin newfag here.
What's the best site to create a wallet with, and where should I avoid like the plague?
If you're using a site, you're doing it wrong.Best is probably Electrum
depends where you live...take a look at all these brokers and what currency they accept https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets
they're exchanges, not brokers
You should just keep your money on the exchange.
It's easy and there if you need to trade it right away.
Once you get over 5k put half on a hardware wallet.
well, yeah but...."A broker is an individual or firm that charges a fee or commission for executing buy and sell orders submitted by an investor."
you can call it as you want anon
