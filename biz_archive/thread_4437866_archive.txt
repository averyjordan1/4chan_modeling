I have a business idea.
I call it the poorhouse.
Basically I would sell poo for a living.
Basically I would start by storing poo in my bathtub and letting people around the world bid on it online.
If that is successful.
I build a giant building with a giant basement and small rooms of which people can rent.
I rent out the rooms to people on the condition that they allow me to harvest their poo.
Getting people to live in my accommodation shouldn't be too hard as the housing market in Australia is very expensive.
Every room will have a toilet where the poo go down a pipe and into machines in the basement.
The machines act like slushi machines as they move the poo about to prevent it from going hard.
Each machine will have a tap so I can take some poo when needed.
Is this a good business idea?
Poorhouse?
Why not call it poohouse?
Who do you think will be your customer demographic?
fpbp in worst thread of all time.
Indians
It was meant to say poohouse but then spellcheck happened.
My target demographic would be scientists, people who eat poo, people with a poo fetish and pranksters and Year 12s who need things for Muck Up Day pranks.

I could make so much money out of their poo.
The eternal aussie "shit"poster
Here's a better idea.
Become a scat pimp.
Get girls to sell their shit to the niche consumer base you put together through an assortment of deals online.
If you have really persnickety consumers, you can effortlessly charge more.
Simple as 1,2,3 if you have the right connections and communication skills.
Do the thing they did in Orange is the new Black where they sold girls pussy juice
SHHHH OP Don't give the pajeets ideas
