When it hits $300 in 2020, you'll feel a lot better.
Yeah chad link always recoverKeep buying dips to improve your averageI bought at 21 cents and then small batches at 19 and 18 so I just need to hit 19 cents to break even.I plan to hold anyways because Sergey is a good leader and link is the best project in crypto rn.If link fails the entire crypto scene fails.
For fucks sake stop checking the price.
All you have to do is hold for a year or two and you are set for life.
LINK is literally the most guaranteed to moon hold you could possibly have and it will literally reach $10 in 2018 or 2019.
