Oh, right.Good find, op
"Confido" is latin for "Trust" which makes it that much funnier.The confido CEO was probably a 200 IQ pajeet who literally played every single one of you while laughing about it right from the very beginning.
its a scam.
i made 2x on it earlier but not touching it again
more likely a 400lb burger who played all pajeets
