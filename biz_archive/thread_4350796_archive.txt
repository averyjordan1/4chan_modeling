Most boring coin ever.
Is it going to do anything?
Seems to just be stagnating
you said this for komodo and it went from $1.80 to $3.
Fucking retard
Buy now because if pbc shills it on thursday we're mooning to $1
It might even be $1 before then when /biz starts pre- shilling
bought in as soon as it was listed on coinspot (ausfag)>already doubled moneyNah dont buy
it went from 18 to 24 cents, double?
