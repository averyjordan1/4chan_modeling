Sold my LISK today on a decent profit.
Check their reddit and find they have "possible" upcoming SDK news on the 22nd so I'm suffering fomo.Think it's worth buying back in at a loss or will it come back down before the 22nd?
i feel like this coin has the potential to 10x
Yes please fill my sell order on hitBTC
JK I cancelled it.
Let's see which way this mahfuck goes
seems like you inadvertently sold the news to soon.
wait until the news is announced, there will probably be a dip because meme
I just set a buy order in way lower than I previously bought.
So if we get a nice dip i'll still profit and have a better position.
Worse case I miss an opportunity.Fuck Fomo!
