Ok, /biz/, I'm long term holding LTC, NAV, ARK, DASH, IOTA.
Tell me where I'm wrong
i guess all you smelly pajeets agree then.
not a single normie fuck wants to argue?
HODL BTC and IOTA, the rest will perish
Dump LTC and NAV for XMR and MOD.
LTC is rocking atm, don't listen to this nigger
Am i going to make it if i hold a bit of everything important (btc,ltc,eth)?
I am not trying to buy lambos just chicken tendies a/c and internet
Not holding BitBean
You bored or something?
Not getting enough attention from mom and dad, or what?
