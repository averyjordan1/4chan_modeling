https://neonewstoday.com/development/onchain-announce-ontology-a-distributed-trust-network-on-neocontract/"Today at the Next Generation Blockchain Networks for Distributed Trust event in Shanghai, Onchain unveiled a new product called Ontology â€“ a distributed trust network.
Ontology incorporates multiple trust types in an integrated protocol system with various blockchains and databases.
Multi-source identities and multi-source data exchange protocols have been implemented into the network, building a distributed trust system that is cross-chain, cross-industry, cross-system, cross-application, and cross-device.
""Ontology will use NeoContract, and projects built upon the network will be able to create NEP5 tokens.
Whilst Ontology will be used for data storage and identity, NEO will be used for asset based functionality."
Yes, and another NEON exchange is launching in 1 day https://neonexchange.org/
