Does networking really work /biz/ or is it just a meme?
is there anyway I can git gud at it to find a job if I am not good at socializing like normies?
People pay $40k/year to go to college just to network
networking is super important in life, yes.
if you're not good at socializing, practice it to get better.
Nice Pepe.
But why would you want to socialize with normans when you have us?
I dont even work, all i do is network.
Connecting people with other people and making a small percentage for it
Never did any networking, cant find job 5 years already, plz help
yes, half the battle of getting a job is being able to ask someone for it
Networking is even more important than skills.
But if you're a robot like me, you can always collect NEETbux.
Invest that momey in crypto and then you WILL make it
it does but autists will struggle with it, which sucks because its a great way to find work
in some cases it is the only skill that you need to make it
