Can bitcoin survive an EMP attack?
If you print it in paper, it will.
Which is why it's a good idea to have backups in multiple media, not just magnetic.
some madman printing out every transaction on every block out there
No
Needs to be quite large of an EMP attack if it also takes out satellites.
Individual private keys take very little space.
The entire blockchain is obviously quite large.
4306255Im the guy who figured out a way on how to preserve and keep all block chains running and usable even during a mass black out EMP.
But no one was interested in hearing it, and their is no way for me to cash out on the idea, So likely it will die with me.
Unfortunately, Im not kind enough to just give it away.
no and neither will credit cards debit cards atms and wire transfers sooooooo whats your point
why don't you make EMPCoin and have /biz/ shill you
u r sooo cool faggot
It's not that simple.
Can your fat mom survive going on a diet?
What?
i'm not just talking about your own personal wallet.
I mean if the entire electrical grid is destroyed, is it still possible to make bitcoin transactions using solar powered devices via bluetooth or NFC?
There will be a total reset of the society if a massive EMP strikes.
A local magnetic event is a bigger threat to your personal wealth.
