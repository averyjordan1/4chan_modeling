GDAX is the best if you live in the USA.
Satoshi Nakamoto confirmed this.
They were the first exchange I used for alt trading, and it seems to be the go to for newbies.
It's been getting slow as fuck lately and either they have a hard time listing coins due to regulations or they're just lazy as fuck.
Once binance makes their UI a bit more attractive like Bittrex's is, it's going to be the biggest alt exchange.
They're quick to add coins and it's slowly siphoning Bittrex's volume.
yeah but they only have btc, eth and ltc
Kucoin.
What?
Binance UI is a lot better than Bittrex.
Also the graphs bug out all the time.
You just have to deal with bots dancing around your orders permanently
I put my small amount of coin into their shit site and I can't withdrawal it at all because of their terrible verification system.
Still have yet to hear back from support.It's been 2 weeks.
Binance is better by miles
