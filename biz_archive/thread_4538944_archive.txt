I want to get into cryptocurrency mining.Can someone explain how to correctly set up the hardware and software, join pools etc.
I want to make sure it works before building anything.
Also how to maximize the lifespan of my hardware.Would a graphics card sandwich work on "ASIC resistant" coins like bitcoin gold and vertcoin?
Don't waste your time and money, you're too late to the game and will never recover your money unless you troll altcoin announcements on bitcointalk and get lucky as fuck with a new coin.
Just bit crypto with your money.
Yes, for a couple of weeks until it melts
*buy crypto
I already have some GPUs and almost free electricity.
I will only mine non-asic coins like zencash, not chinese whale farms.There's no reason not to at least try it, I'm just a total mining noob and don't know how to configure my GPUs to mine, or to join pools.You would have to be stupid to let a rig literally melt, like running it 24/7, closed case with no cooling and not keeping track of the temperature
Well in that case go for it, try it for 2-3 months and u will see.
