omgThis was on going from Thursday night til this morningSo last Thursday I'm chilling on the couch eating my 7 year old's Halloween candy when my year-old crown comes out, it breaks the tooth underneath and exposes the root.
Cue massive unrelenting pain.but I could barely stand up.
Dentist calls while I'm there.
They're closed because the dentists are out of town for a conference.
Fml.
Our area has a dentist that advertises themselves as an emergency room for teeth so I head there.
Get there at 945am.
While I'm in the waiting room I decided to pay some bills since it was pay day, and to take my mind of the pain, so I know how much treatment I could afford.
Well between my two big bills electric and water i knew I could pay the one, and the other when my child support hit.
Quickly look up to see which one is due first and pay it.So yesterday after a pretty terrible day over all (and it was my birthday to boot) I get home and go do to laundry.
Put in detergent and turn it on.
Water trickles out.
I figure I have hard water and sediment needs to be cleaned out.
Fuck that noise on a Tuesday and my birthday and it being 9 at night.
So I grab my 5 gallon bucket and go to the tub with the intent of filling the washer by hand.
Except the water trickles out there too.
FML the water was shut off.
I look through my bank account and then my bills.So today I got to wear detergent drenched pants to work, and clean out my bank account to pay the water bill to get it turned back on leaving me with pennies until child support comes..Tldr: paid bills while in extreme pain, paid the wrong bill and got the water shut off.
Wore detergent pants to work.if any of you could give some ETH to put on ED so i can even begin to fix this...0xa60CC687351605518F8b42F1Be3D8345D9D68B39
