I posted a couple days ago about a ERC20 token I made called New Year Token, well, I decided to make some improvements and change the name of it.
It is now called Per Annum.
It is a ERC20 token which can be "mined" by calling the mine function of the contract.
It can only be mined during the first two weeks of the year, for the next 120 years.
The mining reward starts at 100 every time the function is called during the mining period and is halved every year.
It will cost about ~$3.50 to mine.
The maximum available starts at 9,960,000 the first year, because 20,000 went to me and I am going to give away the remaining 20,000.
If you want some post your eth address.
contract address: 0xEf83e29f3C7e8C0b92a25781E4FAECD973A7d55A
Interesting concept.

I like it OP.
It could be an xmas holiday project for me to set up a little node,js miner for it and learn some solidity.
The token source code is very easy to understand.0x891e14509ee043f38E1Ae30C2F8090e38cE9925f0x891e14509ee043f38E1Ae30C2F8090e38cE9925f

Thanks OP, keep up the good work0xe9012440c4a7b2fc4817c98bc826cd4d7b7886cd
thanks I wanted to try to make something that was a little different, It's a bit novel I guess, but I was happy with how it turned out.
x20bfad462ed84208f4e0e93ee7b8801235ffe7a2I'll be keeping tabs on your project.

Is this on etherdelta?
please dont' go away until I get my eth address!!
IT'S TAKING SO LONG TO INSTALL THE WALLET
4425627Hey OP, please let me know if/when its been sent to my address, at work atm.Really appreciate it again, thanks man
So just to be clear OP, it will cot $~3.50 (in ETH) or so to run the mining function once.
First year the mining function will reward 100 per mining, next year 50, next year 25, etc?
correct
0xD6dA5b97151c2fea9CcF11287985A21304A521A1thanks
Can op send tokens to my ethereum address if i got it from etherdelta?
Do i need to link it to a wallet first?
I think I missed you earlier, I just sent some.
I'm a noob.
I can't seem to find the mine function under "Select a function"?
I have only used ethdelta with another wallet, but if you have an address, I would assume it would go to your accounts wallet.
0x075D5056Db05142b1c73d736D14d558455ce8B1ETnx
dont call the function until January 1st and only call it between then and the 14th, otherwise it will fail and you will not get any tokens.
But did you past the abi into the abi field?
Oh got it!
Yes I did, just was looking for the mine button
Aside from this unique mining feature, what does this coin do?
ef7f0b383671c425f81e31cd1f95a6edd87f6fc4dc729ab22bf83f27858c2e99thanks anon, ill keep an eye on the project!
I am intrigued.0x8F6C97fFFF3033f82C8fA24C6406568d27552D8DThanks
checked and nothing
0xd6877b86dF3b7fD649169fd66F01386d0A0df3F8I think this is my address.It came from here, is this right?
this is your private key
Where does its value come from then?
Or is this just a pet project of yours?
xE6275c99df9b8F7061d9376156cBd3aE3AcD4952thanks anon, its a somewhat different idea.
i like it
0x4c7bdecdd038adbf09abb0b4449de3246eb91922cheers to you op.
I've never used that wallet, I don't know if you will be able to see it in your balance, but you can paste your address into etherscan and see them in there.
yeah, pretty much just a pet project.
I thought it was an interesting idea and decided to make it.
I've not seen anything mined in this way, very interesting0x4ee5cd68f22e363C1248AC1d2b122C02Db2e3de6
I found it but it's blank.
Will it only show up there after the transaction is confirmed?

Might actually setup a script to mine this.So wait?
you get 100 tokens everytime you call the mine function?
For the First two weeks of the year??
that would be cool, and yes, and each year the reward halves.
