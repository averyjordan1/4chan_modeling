This is the power of owning 21 BTC.
*blocks your path*
There is only one Bitcoin, only one who can bend the hash rate to his will.
And he does not share power.
Vers paid shills and altcoin faggots aren't going to affect Bitcoin.You dismissed Bitcoin before and now you're sour grapes.
You fell for the hype and think your shitty altcoin is going to replace bitcoin.
This story has played out so many times before.
You got scammed and deep inside you know your altcoin is a game of musical chairs: Get out before the big hack/dump occurs.Those with 100% Bitcoin sleep well at night :)
