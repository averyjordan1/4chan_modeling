Buy your alts on blockfolio, it's more secure than binance and very easy to use.

whatever man, just buy your BCC through blockfolio already
Retard
bros where is the buy button on blockfolio?
I ONLY buy coin on Blockfolio, you always get the best gainz and always recived forked coins faster than etrade or robinhood.
Binmance is a scam and you dont actaully keep your coins.
Be sure to buy espers my friend.

Use binance, it's legit
