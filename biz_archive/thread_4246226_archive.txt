>> The Vision For QASH: >> We believe in a world where everyone has access to premium financial services, not only the privileged few.
>> Cryptocurrency is the means to achieve this and our mission is to provide the products and services necessary for the Crypto world to become the new mainstream.
>> The future of finance is distributed.
Democratization of finance has begun.
The power is in everyone’s hands.>> At QUOINE, we are launching LIQUID PLATFORM, a single globally-sourced trading platform (World Book) with an associated suite of services (Prime Brokerage).
Combined, these produce the highest level of liquidity in the world—allowing any individual to access the opportunities and wealth the new Crypto economy offers.>> A universal native Token: the QUOINE Liquid Token, QASH, is the fuel that will power all services QUOINE provides.
We are already in talks with financial institutions and partners to make QASH the preferred Token for their own upcoming and existing financial services, as they migrate to decentralized platforms.
We envision QASH will be used in the broader financial industry and any other industries for various purposes including payment and remittance.This shit is going to be big.
