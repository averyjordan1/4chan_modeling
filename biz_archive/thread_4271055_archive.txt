It's that time again where DOGE goes 10x for absolutely no sane reason.
It has the cheapest fees to send to shitty exchanges were some promising coins are.
Been holding 220k since a anon made a post about a pump signal by volume a few days ago.
Buy on rumor, sell on news.
I currently hold 100 million Doge.
i have 10k dogeit was all i could affordi wont become a gorillionaire but hopefully i'll make a few bucks
There's no news to sell against.
This meme of a coin has this crazy habit of just randomly 5-10xing every few months without any good reason.
it's literally in all the exchanges, you can trade against it directly in some of them.Japanese love itand it had nascar and jamaica shit ffsfucking dogecoin is the shit
