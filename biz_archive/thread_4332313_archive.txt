0.38 BTC volume
lmao jesus christ op>undervaluedhow can something that has zero value ever been undervalued
Of course volume would be low right now.
Not a good argument.
It wasn't any different with any other coin when they started out.
I remember when there was one main exchange for BTC and it was trading under $3.00, I would have to wait for a long time to see a trade go by.
Now look.
Some people said BTC had zero value.
Maybe they're going to end up right.
Meanwhile, check out the comparison chart.
fuck off, there are many shitcoins like this.
why is it better than any other coin?
Name some other coins like this.
I'd love to know of more.
I desire riches.
Just wait till this coin gets listed on a big exchange and it goes up 50-100x.
I'm going to link back to this thread when that happens, so hopefully you all will learn how to make money.
good luck, getting listed on big exchanges costs alot of money
EBCC has a marketcap of like $20-30k right now.
Probably a smart thing to throw an eth or two at just in case it gets chosen by a pump group or something, get in before it starts exploding.
At $30k you might as well desuhttps://etherdelta.com/#EBCC-ETHAlso JDI, it only has a ~$40,000 market cap at the ~.002 eth it's going for, you could own a big part of the circulating supply.
Airdrop for that happening in Decemberhttps://etherdelta.com/#JDI-ETH
Bitcurrencyprohttp://coinsmarkets.com/trade-BTC-BTCRP.htmShit is not listed on cmc.
100k for a masternode.
Might moon.
Oh and JDI's max supply is 65,500 and the first airdrop gives out 40% of that with the remainder airdropping in July 2018 IIRC
Because I already own XBC
