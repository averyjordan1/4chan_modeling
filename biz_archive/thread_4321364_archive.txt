There is al reason you idiote are losing money and here it is.
You lost money on crypto (HOW?!)

You'll be fine.Crypto goes in cycles.
Alts season and dump season.
Currently dump season.
Alt season will be after January.
So just hold.Also to be honest, it's not that bad to hold a coin all biz holds since once it pump, you know for sure it'll go to every corner of the internet because /biz/ are internet savvy and knows how to internet.
I don't have link because there's better alts to hold than it.
you won't lose you money but you'll definitely make your money back so just hold if you don't know how to trade.
After a year of crypto and been through the cycles then you will become better at it and know when to buy and sell
