Am I a loser if I get a job at burger king on the weekends for more money?
I work in an office but I don't make as much as I want.
I barely do any workI have interviews for high paying high hour jobs but I haven't yet passed one
No you're not.Collect as much money as you can, put it all on crypto and enjoy retiring early.
