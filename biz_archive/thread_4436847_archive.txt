Good time to buy in?
Price is wavering, I feel uneasy.
volume is low enough that it's some a few people fucking aroundonce that picks up we're going to mars
this crashed too .03 - .04 cents, it's already mooned your retards, but hey dumbass who don't understand price and marketcaps, I can how you bought link, loopring is a good coin but doesn't mean 50x moon, it's mooned 4 - 10x already
link and loop will probs be the same price in the middle of next year yo
be patient with this.
There will be new waves of investors eventually.
News is pretty new still
You need to look at marketcap, where it is vs other similar coinsNow LRC is actually a lot different than its closest competitors but KNC (similar kinda theme) was a 250mm mktcap coin at one pointLRC is still only 50-60mm
