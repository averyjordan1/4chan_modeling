I went all in on ETH at ATH.
Thought it broke critical resistance and was poised for at least 500.Obviously I was wrong.Should I cut my losses right now?
Or bag hold till the Flippening storm is over?Thanks for the input.
Just hold until the dip of BTC and then buy back, and when BTC corrects up, you can rebuy ETH, and it will be like you never lost anything.
Just chill the fuck out and use your brain FFS.
Asia woke up and they are taking profits, relax.
kind of curiious as well, I bought at 360ish, should I hold, is this dip temporary?I don't see others freaking out, this dip seems temporary
Ah, your saying sell now and rebuy sometime in the next few days when BTC hits its lowest point of the dip?
I do think its temporary, it didnt start going down till BCH started to moon.
Last time BCH mooned every coin went down as well.
Perhaps ill sell if the buy wall at 400 breaks, but its looking pretty solid atm
Nooo, hold ETH and trade pairs with BTC.If you sell your ETH for fiat you are fucking retarded, ETH will probably keep it's price or go a bit higher, since it's perceived as a stable coin for people that want to ride this weekend safely.
HODL
This exact shit happened at this exact time yesterday.
Chill out.
It'll go back up same time tomorrow probs.
