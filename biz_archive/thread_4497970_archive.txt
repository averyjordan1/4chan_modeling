If this doesn't make money in crypto, nothing will.
Government money + useful technology + experienced energy team + THE FUCKING PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIAEveryone believed Neo's fake news about government support, but this is real goverment support for POWR.
See ya on the moon cunts.

What is the target for this coin?
How high can it go?
Idk

it's following omg trend of hype and constant news.
prob a billion
I personally believe it will be more valuable than Ethereum because it is actually useful and has government backing.
Comparing the market caps, this coin would go to $99.
I think it will go even more than that though.
I'm not fucking selling my mommy bucks.
ETA 99 smackaroos?
i would actually Cum Everywhere if it went to $99
I would sacrifice my firstborn if it went to 99
I have 0.72 bitcoin to throw into power.
Should I buy in now?
You just have to wait.
I'm guessing about 2 years, maybe more.
Wait for a dip, but it doesn't really matter when.
It's not going to go down below 0.00007 again and will be 0.0001 by next week.
$6 will put it in the top ten.
That seems reasonable to me.
It should be a top 10 coin.
There coins in there that are just concepts with no working products..
