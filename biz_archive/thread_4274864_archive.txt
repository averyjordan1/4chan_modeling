who here getting JUST'd
cant lose more than I already have
Literally how?
I got out of all my alts just after the big bump yesterday, pulled it out into btc and now I feel like I am missing out.
=/
They keep moving their coins around like retards and paying excessive fees to go from one loss to the other without a clear strategy.
first day in a while that im not getting JUSTedwhat are you holding?
the alts I'm holding literally cannot go down lower lol it's only up from here.
I'm indecisive with poor judgementBTC and LINK.
Actually I'm more pissed about missing out on AMIS and Nuls.
Buy EDO and make your money back
believing the LINK memes
You still have your chance with RLC
Everyone seems to be doing well in alts, good for them, but im holding my btc.
I dont understand why these idiots think it is going down to 5k.
The cancellation of b2x is great news in the long run.
