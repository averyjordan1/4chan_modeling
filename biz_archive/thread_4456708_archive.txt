Currently I have this% LTC% LINK% ARK% OMG% HSTI'm thinking of simplifying my portfolio and buying into XMR.% LTC% LINK + HST>?
?Should I hang on to ark or omg?
I'm starting to lose faith in omg and I'm thinking of putting what I have invested into XMR instead.
Get rid of OMG, LINK, and HST.
Keep the LTC and ARK.
Hmm, not bad.
If you're really serious about losing money though, add some XRP and Confido while you're at it
Get rid of OMGnigga are you fucking retarded?
why would you consider selling your lite coin?
it is literally mooning right now.
are you a fucking moron?
Thats probably what I'll do except I'm hanging on to LINK, I think its a good long term hodl.
HST is a shitcoin and I feel stupid for buying it, same with OMG.
I mean after the moon night right this second.
I have a feeling it will dip a bit after that so I can sell at the top and buy the dip.
Also I mistyped that percentage, I'm staying invested in LTC.
