well /biz/ this is it.
I'm a certified fucking failure and am going to just go ahead and give up and kms now.
good luck to you all.
Why would you do such a thing?
Christ.
Just....chill out for an hour.
You started with that 1680 and ended with that 3907?Isn't that good?
Too many trades bro
your mostly getting fucked by the bittrex fees, i you go for a exchange with lower fees as trading your amount of volume is worthless on there.
You were fucking doing fine and got overzealousfees arent even high retard you just need to make 0.5% and you double the fee
Evolution needs to make 1000s of species that go extinct so that one species may be chosen as fittest.
And this applies to individuals within species too.
Even if today we have many superfluous people, most gene-lines will die out either due to competition amongst themselves or during the time of selection pressure (famine, ice age etc).
The catchphrase, for you, in this world of eternal struggle is: "at least, you tried"
Which exchanges have the cheapest fees?I mostly use Bittrex because it has a nice selection of shitcoins, but the fees are kinda high.
jesus christ man... next time just take your profits and wait for a few hours.
you got overconfident and fucked up.
