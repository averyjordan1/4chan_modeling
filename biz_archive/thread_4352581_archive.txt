So I'm helping my parents purchase ETH as a long term investment on Coinbase.My main issue is how much information they require to purchase anything.
We've made just under 10k worth of purchases total, now they won't let us buy anything without supplying yet more info>Occupation>Where the money is coming from>how much you made/make>what brand of toilet paper you useBullshit like that.Is there another exchange I can use that doesn't have a fuck load of invasive questions as a requirement?
A cheaper one?I've really only used Coinbase for fiat -> cryptos up till this point.
Know alll exchanges are like because of KYC Laws and if you do find one, weâ€™ll have fun explaining shit to the IRS
Gemini
I get it, they need some info.
But I found that to be incredibly invasive.I'm fine with a standard level of info.Thanks, will check it out.
