time to moon boyos
of course it is, I sold mine yesterday.
fuck this gay earth.
I was burned very badly by this coin.
NO thanks!
how
Bought after it was listed on KCS for 1080 sats and it never reached that ever again.
Luckily, I sold at around 950.
It's been hanging below 800 for weeks now
why the fuck did you do that?
It was only listed on a single, shit exchange so you thought NOW was a good time to sell?
You deserve to be poor.It's stayed above ICO price since its listing, you could only get burned by this if you're literally a retard who is unable to do research, you also deserve to be poor.
I missed the ICO.
I bought when it got listed on the KuCoin exchange.
THIS BETTER GET TO AT LEAST $1 FFSTHEIR BOTCHED ICO CAUSED ME TO BECOME A NEO BAGHOLDER
then you should have also known that it was ONLY listed on kucoin, which is a brand new, shit exchange.Why would you sell immediately after buying at this price?
I made the correct decision.
Bought at 1080 and took a loss at 950 after I saw it was going down.
Had I held, I would've been over 40% down and holding bags for 2 weeks.
Meanwhile, I recuperated my losses with BCH
