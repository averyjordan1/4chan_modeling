WHAT FUCKING MOD PREEMPTIVELY ARCHIVED MY THREADTHIS IS BUSINESS AND FINANCE

SERIOUSLY WHICH ONE OF YOU CHEETO ENCRUSTED MODS DID IT?
fuck it I'm reposting the OP for visibility.
Mods can suck a dick.
There was a /biz/ bro here yesterday or the day before who said he had built out a system for scraping twitter, reddit, /biz/, and used exchange APIs for signals.Mate if you see this, we've been working on a similar project and have a lot of experience in SaaS and IM in general.
If you see this, will you mind emailing me?bruce@executablemedia.com
