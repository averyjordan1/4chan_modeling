Do whatever you want.
You're going to lose money anyways because you're an impatient fuck.
For the record I moved all my BTC over to XMR on Saturday (now 95% XMR), and yes I see that BTC is rallying.
Am I worried?
fuck no.
But every second I'm loosing another couple of dollars, it's down another 0.5% since I posted the OP.
See 
put it in blue chip stocks dumbass
never sell btc, only add to stack
Montero
I would be several million dollars richer if I had sold my BTC for Ethereum and then bought back BTC when Ethereum was high and BTC was low earlier in the summer.
I also could have lost a large chunk of my money by buying Peercoin/Litecoin/QRK when I began researching cryptos back in 2013.Unless you're a fucking wizard, just stick to BTC.
For every new millionaire who got lucky riding a train, there's at least one person who gets cucked (like the guy who lost 8 BTC in S2X futures the other day)
Just bought 100k.
Yeah, you need to wait to go up again, then you will recover some money and made some profit.Those coins are stable, you are not.
I effectively lost billions of dollars by not buying in 2010
Just hodl
Absolutely.
Best advice.
Put it all in BTC heheheh...
On average, the money is always in the drama coins.
You could just split half your value between 2 warring drama coins and you'll get at least 10% gains every time there's some coinwar.I tip my hedge at you sir.
you fucked up kiddo
don't play with money if you give a shit about it
