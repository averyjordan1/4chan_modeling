https://etherdelta.com/#EPY-ETHJust got added to COIN MARKET CAPhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/emphy/#marketsAlready started to moon, you still have time to get on the train guys.
15 million total coins, probably less circulatingcheap af right now PHD, MBA devsThis is going straight to 1-3$Its not to late
Here we fucking go bois
been shilling for days trying to help yall out, dont cry when you see this pull a 10x today
not you i mean other no EmphyI WILL NOT SHOW EMPaHY for you no EPYs
I'm fully torqued at how high this coin is gonna go.
s/o the fags who shilled me two days ago
Nigga I bought at 28 I'm fine.
get stoked boyswe are going to the moon
solid wall around .01 eth we break that and we make it
"wall" kek
BTW its still barely above ico price, 3$ is the target you have time!!
thats the biggest wall anyways, that says alot, its going places maybe even higher than three, what do you think
oh for sure.
if we break that sorry excuse of a wall it's smooth sailing to $3
.01 is three dollars though haha
really should be going into EBET instead of this.coin has a much more promising project and timeline and better fundamentals.
please forgive my autism, I read as .001
not if you want 10x gain in the next couple hours or soalso guys this has way less than 15 million circulating15 million totalmaybe 5 million circulating
whoooooo its going to the fucking moon
wheres the faggot who sold and told everyone to buy astro, i want to see his tears
you're crazy as fuck if you buy this shit, fake "phd", shitty ico, perfect example of scam.
you've been warned
stay poor anon.
I can almost hear u cutting yourself.
sorry to hear you don't know how to use etherdelta...ran out of gas buddy?
i smell the tears and blood from salty no EPYthis is going more than i though i figured 1 dollar but its got 5 million in circulation, thats a 10 dollar coin
you got source for only 5 mil circulation?
I thought the total was circulating (15 mil).
if it's 5 mil then fuck me, this is going to $5+
Damn I'm a few minutes too late, fucking ED transfers.
Good job to everyone who bought at .0005.
check ether scan, about 10 million locked up
fucking bet, holy shit.
great find ilyhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x50ee674689d75c0f88e8f83cfe8c4b69e8fd590d?a=0xc91fe17ea06651751ef7a995356ec8d90967a4da
What target price are you faggots selling this off?
.01?
fuck that this train is just starting, im selling at .1
Im sure there will be lots of selling at $1 and $3.
I hope we can make it!
AAAAAAAAHHHH ITS DUMPING NOOOOOOOOO YOU GOT ME AGAIN /biz/ YOU MOTHERFUCKER
.00065it's time to accumulate more
its not done dudeonce its top volume on ED than be careful
lmao look at the depth chart, we'll be back in 1 hour
4303388Just larping, I'm actually happy, my buy order got halfway filled at the bottom of this dip, now proud owner of 7600 EPY.Lets do this gentlemen.
What was the price at the time of op post?
.0005
Somewhere around .0005.
So not even 2x since then?
4303490Can confirm.
it hit .00125
this is the dip, so good time to buy in, its at least a 3 dollar coin , probably 10 dollar
$10 long term?
Or short term?
It still has low volume so maybe it can pull off $10 in the short term right?
What about new exchange?
$3 short term guaranteed
cashed out my initial + 0.5 ETH profit, feels good man, now I can just stay in till whenever.
No idea why I didn't start doing this sooner
about 5 million coins in circulation, easy 30 million cap, so 6 dollars short term, 10 dollars is doable, short term, settled at 5 dollars is my bet
lol no.The good news it doesn't need to x10 for massive gains.
Even $1 would be just under x5 at this price, and that's very attainable.
Heh that’s how it’s done mate.
Whenever I buy anything I automatically set a sell, 50% of my holdings at 100% profit and let the rest ride until it makes sense to cash out.I’ve never been underwater.
https://deltabalances.github.io/#0x7990163C40cA13Be8A2d8cA3F02aec15C5c6Cf1esomeone dumped 37 ETH worth, his weak ass hands are almost out so we should be clear to start climbing again
oh absolutely we dipped and its still 2x its preparing for another 2x 50 cents and then 1 dollar, 3 dollars is target consolidation
HERE WE GO AGAIN BOYS
charts are looking same as before when we mooned, seat belts are fucking buckled.
>read thread>no mention of what the fuck the coin is for>no mention of marketcap>just people panic buying and selling some shitcoin on ED with low volume and massive swingswtf is going on seriously, why are you not shilling me to play red on roulette or something like that instead it would make more sense>people really think it's going to 50M marketcap for some shitty airbnb on a blockchain
I'm kind of salty right now but at the same time im happyI bought in at 36 last night and placed a wall at 72 this morning thinking it will take like a week or two to break lmfao Not that mad tho I made  ETH
because we have been shilling for two days, about this coin google it
Market cap is around 1.25 mil.
If you want to know what the coin does it's all on the website, this board is about making money.We don't need to hit 50M market cap to make massive gains you spoon.
5M is a healthy x4, and we're going to get there without much hassle.
There are only 15 unique people in this thread right now, and the coin is fucking mooning, meaning no one outside of here cares, even though there have been threads for the past few days.
You all had your chance to load up, if you listened and dumped just $2,500 when we told you, you would have had $10,000 by now, and it's still going to climb
Just bought in with 6 ETH, i hope you faggots are right about this
Good job buying at the Top!
doesnt understand how volume works.Selling $10 would tank this token, even if there actually were buy orders available to fulfill that price.
no you moron this was mooning before i made the first thread todayits natural
hes already up 10% you moronlmao
.001 is the price to buy in if you want to 10x.005 if you want to 2xnot much time left
you are quite the faggot, he will more than 10x if hes doesnt panic sell
Just a few more ETh and this shit is going to go bananas
THIS HASNT EVEN BEGUN TO MOONTOO THE MOON FUCK YEAH
I'll catch the next pump instead.
Soon as I figure out how the fuck you use EtherDelta
Yea what the fuck is this coin
senpai its not done yetits at 30 cents and will be 1 dollar minimum3 dollar consolidation is strongly possible5 dollars even
create a wallet, or import a wallet with private keygoto the market you want to buyclick deposit, leave .002 eth in your wallet though, thank me laterbuy what you wantsellwithdraw back into walletgoto transfer and put it in any wallet you want
Funny, a guy sold $13K this morning and the coin is fine, retard
this is actually huge.
just bought 5k worth.
next airbnb of crypto
Download Metamask, log in, dump in some ETH from Bittrex or buy directly from Coinbase with the Deposit button, when you go to ED it will log you in via MetaMask and you just need to deposit your ETH into your Etherdelta wallet
Shit their white paper is impressive
k would sink it back to where it was this morning dumb fuck, do you not understand math?
Your shilling is not working guys, this shitcoin is worthless
The amount of coordinated shilling for this coin is astounding to me.
Someone is putting way too much effort into this.
we are not trying to pump faggotwe are letting you know about a gem that will 10xffs
I'm sorry, I can't hear you from all the way up here at 32 cents.
not really
don't be this guy who is mad he didn't buy in low and is now FUDing
Are you actually literally retarded?
How fucking tiny do you think the market cap of this coin is that $10k would drop it that much.
I bet you said that for CFD tooloser's mentality
sick looking triangle forming, once it breaks .001 its going to goto the fucking moon
I'm actually all in for Confido.
Lmao
seems like a decent project, my only issue is the roadmap says nothing until june 2018.i guess it doesnt matter since 90% of coins pump without a product.
kek
Low as fuck volume staying away
hahahahahahahahahaah stay poor
I've got my capital in binance atm, how can I transfer from Binance to MetaMask?
Get dumped by random pajeet
What kind of funds were you planning on withdrawing?
1,000 ETH or something?
and watch it bounce back higher?sure thing
 posters  replies >one guy replying to every single negative postI wonder who could be behind this?
Lmao you just need 10 eth to crash this plane
Crash it then fucking faggot, you're shit at spreading FUDIt's trading at 0.001 now
How much do they pay you, Pajeet?
Where the fuck is their contract address?
x50ee674689d75c0f88e8f83cfe8c4b69e8fd590d
Sell wall of 18 eth cant wait for this to moon more, i got paid nothing to tell you about this gem
btw thats probably just a guy trying to get people to dump into his buys
Only 7.3m supplyThia thing gets me erect
You know you can mouse over the ID and it tells you the number of posts by the ID.
>Currently only on EtherDelta, exchanges coming soon>Total supply 15,375,000 EPY>Current price $0.30>So that makes the market cap ~4.6MM USDI'll leave this here and let you make your own decision, anons.
My fellow Emphy bros, please bump my thread 
Price predictions this week?
yooo tit faggots, why cmc say 15mil total when in the whitepaper it says 100mil supply
 It doesn't.
It clearly states Total EPY: 15,375,000.
The only place it states 100 mil is where it says that each token can be split into 100 mil pieces.
Where to buy it?
who else got pajeet'd by this shitcoin?
