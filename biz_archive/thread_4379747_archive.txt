Okay, /biz/.
It has come to my conclusion, that I am a worthless low-class idiot without any understanding of how the big boys interact and what their world is like in general.
I need to gain social skills.How do I get into close proximity of successful people?
The big fish.
Successful business owners, executives, etc.I want their intricacies to rub off on me.
I want to observe.
I want to learn.
I also want connections.
the art of manifestation
Gee, I guess I'll just think about it really hard and not couple it with any physical actions.
Thanks doc XDDDDDD
