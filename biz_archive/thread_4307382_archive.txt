Got about 20 ETH to throw around, what do I put it in for a safe gain?
I'm thinking ARK but shill me something different if you can.Pic related, don't want to feel this.
buy powerledger LOL biggest gainz in 2018
MTL is a great buy right now at ATL and its launching fairly soon.
Its an easy 2x.
Also look at SALT its pretty low atm, WTC is alright too.
BCHWill be  in a week
There was a thread on here earlier for the safest store of value right now.
Got a link?
RLC
Piss off with your flippening bullshit
What does MTL even do?
and when is it launching?
etc isn't looking too bad right now
They have 150 weed dispensaries/merchants on board for when they launch.
Its a payment proccesor for high risk business and more so people can pay with fiat and they recieve crypto.
They are estimating to process 1 mil $ per day in the first year which will equate to buy pressure on MTL.
DYOR there are some good interviews on youtube.
They are launching Q4 17 so soon but it might be slightly delayed.
They have a bunch of ex Apple employees and people from visa etc its the real deal.
Short term MOD, XMR.
Medium term REQ.
Long term stay with ETH.
Interesting.
Might chuck a few ETH at it after looking into it if it looks the goods.Thanks anon
I've considered REQ.
After this flippening bullshit ends surely money will flow back into it as it's a half decent project
