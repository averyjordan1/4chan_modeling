Will ODN survive this pajeet PnD?
Will it thrive after the fork?
Nobody knows but im in for one hell of an alt ride
I bought 10k around 0.20-0.25$.
Feeling quite comfy actually.
No intention of selling for a while.
def comfy
Gradually accumulated 10k with an average buy of ~28c, if they deliver and market it properly, this will be golden.

Honestly, if just Trex or Polo, it would make huge gains.
HitBTC is an altcoin burial ground...
Moon or death.
This I promise, as your ODN war priestess.
They have a new 3 month roadmap, messenger and payment alpha should be done by then.
I think it'll be fine.
We'll all make it boys
Everytime someone posts about odn ask why only 10% of the total supply is circulating and see the thread disappear
Cringe
% of 90m is 9m, current circulating supply is 24m, your math is a little off but I see the concern, Why does any company hold the majority of shares?
It's to create an incentive-driven team.
You really think they're going to dump their shares anytime soon?
Antshares held 50%.
Didn't seem to be a problem
I follow every odn thread.
That doesn't happen at all.
The supply circulating is actually 25ish%.
Many high-cap coins have lower amounts than that.
STFU.
Pretty comfy right now.
I just keep buying more with every paycheck.
We're gonna make it.
