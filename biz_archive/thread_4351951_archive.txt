what price would you sell your Link at?
Is $1/link too low?
If it reaches $1 you bet your ass its going to reach $5.
Like most people said, its moon or cardboard box for a first mover tech this great.
LINK won't spend much time at $1.
By the time it moons it's going to moon hard as fuck.
Will I make it guys?
