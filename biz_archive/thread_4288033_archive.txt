I lost 8% so far, dont know how you would lose everything thoughnot the end of the world not even the end of bitcoin some gooks are just pumping it hard
it's been an overall bull market since March.
How can you have lost everything?
LOL unless you bet it all on a shitcoin like NULS at ATH

It's over.
The Koreans fucked us.
how the fuck can you lose "it all".
It's physically impossible unless your coin goes tits up.Sit on it, even if it takes a year.
It's eventually going to go back at least up to where you bought it.
youre a moron.IF you have 8k in bitcoin, you have 8k in bit coin.Sit on it, and wait for it to go back to where you bought it, or higher.Fuck.....youre a moron.
