I don't do ta and I rarely fomo in to coins.
I've made 2-3x my initial money by researching fundamentals and occasionally letting /biz/ shill me on coins but missed out on some truly insane moon missions.Any advice on how to up my game?
Or do I just keep blindly thrashing about in the dark?
LOL same boat as u anon.
cept i made about 1.5x the same amount of money
use TA to make money after the moon and fundamentals to make money before the moon
look for new missions instead of fighting against bag holders.for example, everytime OMG goes up, long time bagholders dump.
today's new mission: NULS (coin from inchain)
Learn what/where pressure is on order books.
You can typically bounce between where the buy/sell pressure is.
Decided I am going to put $5 k in the Coinbase to start.
All of my Uber/Lyft income will be rolling into some cryptos for a while to be left for the long term.Wish me luck
Uber fag here again, I am going to hold off on BTC.... going to do eth, neo, xrp
explain more if you would, I think I've been seeing it, but I'm not sure I'm correctly identifying
I was really disciplined at the start and slowly watched how certain coins reacted to the market across time before investing.
With a slew of shitty ICOs, awful fomo buys, and one phishing incident I'm back at the start.It is seriously best to just take it slow.
Realize you're going to miss out on a lot of moon missions but be grateful for the few you're on because with crypto's volatility you can make some nice money from only a few good trades.
