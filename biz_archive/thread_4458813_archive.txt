Anyone here in on XMR?
Where do you see it going in the next 2-3 months?
What exchanges do you use and can you purchase it with fiat or do you have to go through btc?
Let's turn this into an XMR thread.
Zencash
why zencash specifically?
low fees?
not scammy/shady?
good UI?
bump cause I know there's more ppl watching XMR
