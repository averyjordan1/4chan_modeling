See you at 200m$ market cap
Quick question regarding cryptopia and getting added there.They want a fee off 5.000.000 DOT ( which are ~5BTC atm) to list a new coin.Are those devs REALLY PAYING 40k$ TO GET LISTET ON CRYPTOPIA?
Tfw already up more than 100% on this shit.Only 50%?
I'm balls deep, nigger!Nah, I'll see you at $300m market cap.
$10 a piece of HST will make me filthy rich.Idk and I don't care.
Ask them in the telegram t.mr/horizonstate.One thing I know for sure is this coin will make me so much money.
Stupid /biz/tards haven't even noticed this gem.
I can't fucking go to sleep, because I'm so excited from the listing + all the upcoming news.
Holy fucking shit
I need this to dip again so I can buy in more.....
It's dipping a little on ED.

HST will keep pumping for the next few weeks.

Stop being an idiot
Im buying high and selling lowFace it, that's what you're doing otherwise there would be no way to lose money on thisUnless of course, you're FOMO buying from some other trash coin you already lost money in, in that case, be patient, if you can't sell and gtfo
This desu.You only lose money when you sell at loss.
Buy high, sell low.I was down more than 50% on HST last week, but I fucking held it and today I'm in the green again thanks to HST.
