Chainlink allows ETH to run oracles.but who cares?
Can anyone answer this simple question?
Gaylink won't moon until people know why.
Can you red pill me on link?
I'm about to drop 50% of my stack in but my only issue is, is the use case for the token enough?
Are think "link is a scam" FUD posts warranted?
its a scam in that it dumped 75% from peak, where people got 'tricked' into buyingnow is a good place to buy, it wont go lower.
eh, I guess on-chain transactions, like maybe converting one token to another, or keeping somekind of database, would be super secure.
But The second you introduce off-chain data the Oracle's significance goes from virtually 100% trustworthy, to just a slightly higher hurdle for fraud.I mean it doesn't solve what I call the "API Problem" - like whatever is feeding data into the contract, how do we know that it's not being manipulated with to produce false outputs?
How do we know after a transaction happens, the conditions off-chain are reversed?
