Hey guys, just interested in what you guys are holding (percent wise).
And is there any sort of aggregate guide to the current top alts?
I don't want to load up on a bunch of coins that are competing to solve the same problem.
Currently I'm holding ETH, XMR and LTC, and w8ing for my VTC bags to ripen up in December, but I'm interested in the following shitstorm:>LINK, NEO, ARK, OMG, REQ, IOTA, WTC, NAV, DCR, XRP, DASHAnd if anyone could break down the market demographics, use cases etc of each, or know of a (generally unbiased) place with general information in aggregate, please let me know!
Oh, forgot to mention, I hold some RCN as well, but that's a LTH
4326261Gonna keep this updated with things I remember I need to be reading about:>LISK, XLMI know 90% of these coins won't be anything in the future, but still I'd like to ride the swings while I can.
QTUM
