Are "network marketing opportunities" a good idea?Basically a high school friend told me to apply.
Its a marketing company apparently.
Not really sure what they'll have me doing but my friend said that it is 5-10 hours a week, and making "decent money.
"Trying to diversify my income instead of being wagecuck.
Is this a scam or what?
Seems legit.
shameless self bump
"network marketing opportunities"gas yourself
"network marketing opportunities"it's the new term for "multilevel marketing" which replaced the previous term - pyramid scheme.
people do make money in these things, but they're near the top (have been in it longer).
if you're prone to giving into peer pressure and you don't want to shell out a lot of money, you may want to respectfully decline the invitation.

network marketing opportunitiesAlso known as MLM or Pyramid/Ponzi schemes.Personally I would just avoid it.
Being a wagecuck is actually better than that shit, they usually have you shell out a ton of money to buy their shitty products, then you have to shill them to other people to make your money back.Some people make money, but there's plenty of stories of people getting way too deep and losing all of their money to that shit.
Some of them even have this creepy cult attitude.
Also the only reason your friend told you to apply was because he's going to make money off of you applying.
Like a referral system or some shit.Did this guy contact you out of nowhere after not talking for a while?
