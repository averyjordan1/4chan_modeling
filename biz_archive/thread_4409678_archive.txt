The pump has started.
Get in now before it's too late.
tfw since i've started I have sold atleast all my holds atleast once Except Monero.
I don't just sell Monero for a quick buck.
I accumulate.
I understand it's potential.
I don't even care wat price it is at.
I just, get fiat and buy.Monero will be Millions!
better store of value than artificially inflated BTC.
50% in monerocan't even buy anything else right now because don't want to sell any of it before $200it is primed for a next wave already, just lacks volume
The pump has started.
Get in now before it's too late.I'm already in.
I want it to drop below $100 again so I can buy more, damnit.
Already in for 6k usd.
I bought in at $128.
Should I average down and buy in now?
Yeah, why not.
Monero is going $200 soon, so up to you what price you think to buy up to.
Already in for 6k usd.
I bought in at $128.
Should I average down and buy in now?I would.
Because Monero is a long-term hold coin I think both dollar cost averaging and buying the dips are winning strategies.
