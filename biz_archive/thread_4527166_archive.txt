I want to send ARK from Binance to my wallet.
What is a label?
It doesnt matter what you type in there, just call it "ARK" or something.
It's a label for your address.
4527283Write anything, just for you to remember.
Its the same in most crypto wallets.
Keep holding, fellow arkie.
It's only a small amount, not even 200.
Not sure if it will ever be something substantial.
