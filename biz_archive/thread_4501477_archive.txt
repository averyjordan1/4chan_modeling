Is it a bad idea to buy eth now?
Who will mine ETH if BitcoinGold moon?
Ethereum may become the new #1 IF it's discovered that the BTC rise this year was created by fraudulent means as in the Emperor has no clothes = real value (see @Bitfinexed on twitter to see how deep the rabbit hole goes)>Warning Signs About Another Giant Bitcoin Exchangehttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html?_r=1

eth is a shitcoin pumped due to skeletor's aura
if btc crashes, all of crypto crashes and we enter a bear market for at least a year.
if you want to hedge against bitcoin, look to investments outside of crypto.
don't be naive.
If BTC crashes so will the bubble, and nobody will give enough of a fuck about criptos to make them a good investement.
Eth will never be number one.Think of it this way, bitcoin is like the iphone, and ethereum is like an android.
At the end of the day when the normies catch up, they don't want the complicated wumbo jumbo.
They want capital.
Ethereum is fully capable of doing everything better but as far as the everyday person goes, all they want is what gets the job done.
No, ETH isn't the best for moon missions, but it will steadily rise.
You can expect to have it go to 500-600 within a few months.I use ETH to store value now for trading instead of BTC, all this "muh dragon slayer" and "muh BCH flippening" is scary.
I don't think anything can shake BTC but I'd rather not bet stacks on those opinionstwitter.com/lambolydia
Exactly what i'm doing, ETH is stable and that's perfect as trading capital.
