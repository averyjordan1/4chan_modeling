Also people with +100k tell us if you are affected by shills and fuds in here a lot?
$75k, was at 100k three days ago but I stayed in btc/alts (neo/xlm/rlc).
If we were affected by shills and fuds do you think we'd have 100K+?
~400k
Started with 3k now @ 8k
K, now at 5.3K.
Been at it since 2 months.
Lost shit tons of money in the begining.
Went full in BTC I trust afterward and finally started to make money.
Made a little bit of money on the bch pump and dump.

Teach me, senpai.
I want to be like you.
Unironically /biz/ is my greatest source of trades.
You'll need to find the gems hidden among the shit being shilled.
Hype and shill levels are a good indicator for quick PnD (eg.
chainlink)
$355, started mid September.3.5% up in $35% down in BTCI don't know exactly but the ETH value must be up by ~15%.Pretty good going for only holding shitcoins I'd say.
