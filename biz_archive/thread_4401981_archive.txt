I never look at blockfolio, I just buy some coin then set a series of limit orders.
Sometimes it takes awhile sometimes it goes quick.
I always keep a reserve of 50% liquid so if the coin actually moons and holds or keeps going up at all I can drop a good chunk at a price i'm happy with.
Where is your stop loss?I do the opposite, I set a stop loss to make sure I dont get just-ed and I set alerts for profit targets
