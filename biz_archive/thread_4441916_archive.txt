Has anyone here actually used their coins or tokens for anything?
I once paid for a can girl using Bitcoin but don't see the point of using these other shit coins, they seem like a bunch of scams

I've bought some amazon gift cards with bitcoin before.
I sent someone ark because they made a Kim Possible ark OC I liked.
I'll probably play that PEPECASH game when its released.
I bought some gift cards for a business I was running, saved money getting the gift cards to bump my profits up by 20% or so but lost out on long term mooning potential.I bought a console with dogecoin at its peak so that wasnt too bad.
Remember when people said google doesnâ€™t have a product and they only offer a free service buying their stock is like burning money?
This is what you sound like now.
yes.
i'll just leave the rest up to your imagination.

Tokens are literally worthless unless you can find another idiot to pay more for them than than you did.Bitcoin had a pretty impressive uptick in real-world adoption a few years ago, but fees killed that entirely.
I really can't see cash or an alt overtaking it though.
