How many sats do you need to buy bcash?
I just think it's retarded to think in terms of fiat if your end goal is to flip with BTC
once we go over 4k usd we are in the greed phase
doesn't realize we're in the Chad Fad>doesn't see that Bitcoin Cash is the new Bitcoin>doesn't see the impending collapse of the legacy chain as capital rapidly leaves will cause massive panic and unimaginable selloffs

doesn't understand that killing BTC will destroy confidence in crypto as a store of value for decades, if not forever>thinks that there will still be a "crown" to take if the "flippening" succeeds>is as stupid as the chink miners scrambling to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs
imagine being so stupid you fall for those memes
CASH WHALE CASH WHALE STOP THE CRASH WHALE!
