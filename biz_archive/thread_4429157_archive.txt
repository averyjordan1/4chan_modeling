I just spoke to one of the guys in the so called "coordinated pump" group for Mod - and I can confirm that it is happening 100%.
Yesterday there were rumours flying aroung Modum and a few other cryptocurrencies would pump, but Modum specifically to $8+ around 7pm ET today.
What's even crazier is that these are the same guys that pumped Swarm City (SWT) through the god damn roof yesterday up 600%.
I would NOT be surprised if they go through with this today and by the looks of it, it's already getting started.
Good chance to take some profits later today.
lmao I bought into the fomo this morning.. already up 20% I'm not complaining!
