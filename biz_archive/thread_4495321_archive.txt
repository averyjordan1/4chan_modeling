Rune just showed the new UI mock up for COSS.
Makes me want to throw money at my screen like it's a stripper.

Looks like Binance.
Not a bad thing.
If Coss takes off this year, I'll be sitting pretty with some nice passive income from my 325k Coss.
$1,000/week easy.
Looks like shit.
Also does it support orderbook matching?
No way, 325k will give you $1,000 a week?!!
are you serious!!!!!!
How much will it give you in like 2-3 years????
How much volume does the exchange need for you to make those types of gains?????
I NEED GAINS ANON!!!!!!
I don't think it looks like shit but not super great either.
It's way better than the dog shit they currently have though
Yeah, a lot of people are upset, but COSS never claimed to have a finished product THEY ARE IN BETA... but not for long.
And the whales know this.
Accumulation phase is ending.
COSS is going to be the biggest gainer of 2018.
Anybody who fails to see it now will be left in the dust.
BUY COSS>BUY COSSkek seriously?
did they not take 5 minutes to look it over or is this an attempt at subliminal messaging?
They even fucked up the mock-up UI?
I think one of those “Buy” options was supposed to say “sell” Jesus they are incompetent
The exchange would have to get to ~$40,000,000/day in trading volume which means in the top 20 exchanges.
