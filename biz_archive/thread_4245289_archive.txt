You should buy some dumbbells.
When you're stressed do curls.
Gains all round.
Not even kidding.
Tfw your ex gave best head you ever had.Tfw fucking model hookers now with crypto gains

you dont belong on /biz/
If it makes you feel any better, your ex probably got or will get sexually assaulted by some asshole she'll be working with at some point.
Of course she'll never talk about it.
It's okay bro my ex-gf was a cheating slut.
I still fuck her from time to time though because she's hot and good in bed.
fitthey have nothing to offer apart from endless disinformation and faggotry
trust me.
Modelling is the most vapid, narcisstic soul sucking industry there is.
Don't worry about it as a girl she's got very short lifespan on beauty/fertility.
So long as you get yourself back in shape she'll be pining after you once you hit 30s and your banging early 20s girls.
Don’t waste your time with dumbbells if you’re a beginner.
Do barbell compound lifts 3 times per week and in 1 year you’ll be a person you never knew you could become.
I unironically have a home gym so yeah you're right.
But OP needs a way to quickly destress without comfort eating.
He's not going to go to the gym.
He's fat so clearly has zero discipline.
Crypto>GF all day every day my man...Legit thinking about dumping my gf for this once in a life time opportunity
