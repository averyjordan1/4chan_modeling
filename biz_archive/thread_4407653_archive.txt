Which altcoin will moon soon?
Probably a bunch if btc stops threatening $8k.
If it keeps going I think only coins with news in the next 48 hour will pump.
Not sure if they'll moon though.
Maybe 30%.
astro
Ltc
KNC going to be announced on Bithumb
Monaco is one that I'm keeping my eye on to moon here soon
UFR once they burn their unsold tokens and release the alpha version of their platform
umm forget about me
FACTOM, the time is coming.
