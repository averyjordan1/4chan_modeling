Free money for any devs:Tokenize btc and put it on the eth chain in a secure way.
That is the most retarded thing I have ever read.
Do you have any idea what give BTC its price?
Crypto-boomers
Why is it retarded?
Can interface with eth smart contract and actually be sent without $10 fees
theres already ebtc
not the same thing, it's literally just a token with 21M supply.
Not redeemable for real BTC.
It would have to rely on a third party btc repository.
A trusted party.
Which smart contracts are designed to cut out.
