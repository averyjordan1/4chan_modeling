SALT is about to launch their platform.Their token is worth 25$ if you use it to pay off balance.You can currently buy the token for under 5 dollars right now.The market will eventually bring this token to 25$Remember our goal is to stack more LINKS and joining other moon missions is the smart thing to do
So you're saying I sell my Link, buy Salt, wait for it to 5x and then sell to buy more Link?
I imagine Link will be even cheaper then too.Sounds good.
Linkmarines won't bend the knee so easily.
I'll have to consult Rory through slack for his input, so you will get a response in about 3 months.
the coin does nothing!
U r retarded and havent looked into its potential , stay poor faggot
