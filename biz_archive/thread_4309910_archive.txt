I dont understand how inflation rate of 200% will impact the price in the future.
After the fork i expect the price to readjust to -90% lvl.
Right now it's close to $2000, after the readjustment i see it around $1200
Plz answer!
What will happen after the update on the difficulty?
Will miners still stick to BCH?
