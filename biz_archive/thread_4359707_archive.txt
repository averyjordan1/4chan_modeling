so i work at a general store in the country where i can try to sell whatever i want and i would like to have a few "success stories" under my belt to secure my future by making me indispensable if the owner sells to someone else or something that i could continue to do on my own or even as a side job... i was thinking i could sell some dash cams since it's useful and hasn't caught on here yet ... quality water purifier for the house is another thing that is needed... should i just buy them from like amazon and add my cut to the selling price or should i try to contact the company to see if we could find an arrangement?
i don't think i would sell a lot of em and i don't want to have a massive inventory.
not sure if it's worth importing shit from alibaba... so i'm fishing for ideas in general.
one thing that is kind of working is make little thematic racks like a selection of shit for the phone... i should find half a dozen other good ideas like that.
