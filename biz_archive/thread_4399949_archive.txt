>he hasn't realized that there's no incentive for selling astro
They're paying out dividends to coin holders right?
in december is first dividends.
also a 1.5mm airdrop to token holders for more astro babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  year hold, never selling
4399975which means the price will continue to rise until dividends which means buy now and hodl :^)
Seems like a pretty comfy hold either way.
There will be constant demand for the token as long as dividends are being paid out.Do you have a link for confirmation of the December dividend payment?
do your own research.
its listed all over the documentation.... >dividend payouts are highly valued, and obviously shared.
Go fucking research it yourself.
This isn't a free hand out

I know something you guys don't.

Fucking checked
how does price increase if no one is selling?
You know a person could have moved from their ICO wallet to EtherDelta weeks ago right?I don't know what the FOMO will do to the price, but I don't think you want to be HODLing when the app comes out.
