Hello Guys,I was a early Investor in XMR, STRAT, POSW, AntShares.
Of course I made also stupid choices, however Im 300x up.
My life didn't really changed, i just have nicer sneakers now, eat everyday out and don't worry about bills.
I work 50% less and have enought time to hit the gym.
I also have a Trap Girlfriend now, that likes the security that comes with Money.
I found a Coin that will do a 10x.
Im sorry that it is not a 100x anon.
However if you find another 10x after this Coin you made 100x.The Coin Im talking about is TokenCard TKN.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tokencard/TenX and Monaco are 2 other Cryptodebitcards listed on Bittrex and both already went to the Moon.
TenX was at 550 Million Marketcap and Monaco at 230 Million Marketcap.Now there is another Card Project that is superior to both of them and Valued only at 30 Million.
I suspect TKN to do a 6x - 10x until April 2018.
The Roadmap of TokenCard is packed with releases until April 2018 Ending with the General Public Release.Roadmap:https://trello.com/b/8v1H0odv/token-product-roadmap-publicThe Big Advantage over every other CryptodebitCard is described in the pic.
You keep your private Keys as you simple link your Wallet (MyEtherWallet) to Tokencard.
With other Centralized Services like Monaco, TenX and Centra you have to trust them with your Keys.I think we will see very soon much more announcements of Partnered Projects like SIngularDTV.https://medium.com/@SingularDTV/singulardtv-and-a-sngls-visa-debit-token-card-993c76e58af5I suspect also Services like MyEtherWallet will offer branded TokenCard DebitCards.
Futher there is Rumors that there is a Partnership between the Ethereum Foundation and TokenCard coming.
Basically ETH will offer branded Ethereum DebitCards based on the TokenCard Whitelabel Program.
You have to know that TokenCard has a Person in the Company thats Job Description is "Director of Partnerships".
