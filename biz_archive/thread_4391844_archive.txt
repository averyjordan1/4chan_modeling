I have a problem other students and market researchers might also face: how to get more respondents to answer my 10q survey in short time span?
(and no, i will not shill it here).
For a good sample size I need about 200 answers more from the millenial and genZ respondents demographic to get to n=384.
How do you get (potential) customers and just people in general to answer your survey?
Obviously doing the legwork and asking people in person is one way.
But are there other smart and time efficient methods anons here have experience with?
