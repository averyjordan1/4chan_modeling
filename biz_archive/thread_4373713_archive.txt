How are people comparing SLR to POWR?Power Ledger has - Elon Musk rumors, CONFIRMED partnership with Origin Energy (AU's largest energy provider, operates in NZ and India as well), working product, working APP, will be implemented in the real world in the following months through Origin, and political and celebrity endorsements.Solar coin has... what?
Can someone explain why anyone would invest in SLR over POWR?
Or is it because this is crypto and retards just gamble on coins without researching.
Is it too late to get into POWR?
I like their website a lot.
Wait for a day this week when you don't read about it on 4 chang
POWR is a shitty coin with no token economical value
And yet it has a partnership with Origin which is a billion dollar energy company.... it has already achieved what no other cryptocurrency has ever accomplished.
biz will be committing suicide en masse when this moons.
