I think this may be the most innovative new tech outside the top 10. just read this:PSW is introducing a new protocol called Trustless Proof of Stake (TPoS).
Instead of using just a public and private key, it uses triplet-based encryption which has a third key, a shared key.
This allows the masternode network to stake but not spend your coins, meaning 24/7 trustless staking.. all from your Ledger Nano S. Yes, posw is ledger supported too.
Now the testnet is going live in 2 weeks.
I will be participating and will provide feedback to you guys.
After that (Dec-Jan) the team will begin to market PSW as the first staking bank, supporting all major PoS coins.
Think what this means guys... you have all your crypto staking in one simple place, in real time and essentially in cold storage.What does /biz/ think of this tech?
im doubtful, but i do love me a ruse now and again
Jesus christ man let go of that piece of shit coin
I let go the old idea and old team ages ago.
Before there was no TPoS and it was essentially centralized and insecure, i didn't use it myselfThis is a totally different project and rebranding will represent that soon.Just trying to bring TPoS to you guys attention.
It's a big step forward for staking and fund security in crypto.
If posw works out it'll be good for the whole space
I used to think the same to be honest.
Thought it would die and go to 100 sats and be forgotten.
Apparently not.
They got some stuff coming out.
this is a good coin
shhhhhh i'm still accumulating
 mil market cap is a joke.
prime accumulation time.
once the news gets out we've got no resistance until 4000 which is already 2x.long term though.. jeeez
Well Hi Pajeet!
I haven't seen you in months!
How is shit street living treating you?
Liking your dysentery??
fuck sake, you're blinded by the past rep. Tell me why TPoS doesn't have insane potential
boop
