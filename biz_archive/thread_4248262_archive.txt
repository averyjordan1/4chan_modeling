falling for the free money memeKEK
I don't even understand.It's not like btc is going to fall after b2x split.
Why did ANYONE even assume it would?
There's no reason to sell at all.
snapshotsplitThere won't be two chains after the fork.
One will win and the other will be abandoned.
There'll be a dip as some guys who took money out of alts to put into BTC pull out and back into alts, but a shitload of the money that's gone into BTC is institutional or normie and they're hardly going to be selling so they can buy CFD or whatever bullshit is flavour of the hour.
A smallish dip and then onwards to next ATH after fork.
I think we all know which one
Yall like 14 year old grills on facebookHOrrible thing happened.
But I dont wanna talk about it.Explain ffsIt will be abandoned when?
Immediately after the fork?
That cca 17M BTC supply remains still the same either way?
