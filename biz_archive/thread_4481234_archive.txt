As soon as all the link hodlers noose themselves, we buy the dip!
It really seems like it wont go any lower.
Even this BTC / tether FUD barely moved it.
Because all the sellers would have already sold during this month's dip.
Sergey would have to die or some other news needs to come out for it to dip lower.
Pajeets crying about 0.50-0.15 crash, in 1 year when LINK is $35+ nolinkies will be necking that they didnt buy at 0.50.
Screen cap this

gotchu bud
not moving, only rottingit's dead
think of all the crypto that is lost in accounts of dead people.
any solution to this major drawback of decentralized currency?
I understand that it can increase the value, but on a max total supply currency, it could have a reverse effect
