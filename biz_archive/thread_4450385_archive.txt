Shalom,The exit pump went well and we sold all our BTC at new ATH.
Management of the Tether company was handed over to Rajet Pajeet to take care of the oncoming legal heat.
The entire Gentile population are still ignorant of our subversive ways and everything seems normal.
We urge you to stay out of BTC and related USDT markets for a short whiele, and observing 7 days of rest(even you Schlomo).
We shall then resume kikeing after the coming crisis has cooled down and buy cheap altcoins from the now panicking Goyim.
Praise Yahweh!t.
Rabbi Eli Silberbaum.
this but unironically.Rule number one: Someone is always the loser.
Always taking credit for White ingenuity.
