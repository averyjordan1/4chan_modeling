Does this mean the partnership is dead and swift will use something else now?
There never was shit all m8
the one time they fucked up was when they got on the radar of the autistic biz tards that made up shit and expectations thus pumping the price now this is the result
ChainLink shouldn't (and hopefully isn't) concentrate on Swift.
That's just biztard greed and delusion.
It's got so many more use cases and Swift is a shit tier finance company that's about to get fucked up by Ripple.
Not even necessarily XRP.
Just Ripple.
