You need to send your ID to Bittrex and GDAX in order to withdraw your coins?
Is there an exchange other than Etherdelta that doesn't require documents and pictures?
Binance, HitBTC, Cryptopia, Coinexchange etc
For any amount?
Was thinking of using the coinbase to GDAX to buy eth
Anywhere that doesn't trade in dollars.
Once you get away from the legacy banking system, things go much smoother.
