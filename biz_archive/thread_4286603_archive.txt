I bought 200 of btc on coinbase, I apparently I did it twice.
Coinbase won't let me cancel the order.
What would happen if I got my bank to cancel the charges before the bitcoin arrives on the 16th?
You get a special medal for being a cute little cock sucker
>$400just keep it lol
Sell the extra 200 cocksucker, then do the complain at coinbase.
Just get the position out if you made error then complain to coinbase later
they will still credit ur btc but not let you withdraw or sell it, ur account will be practically locked, their suport is very shit, and if you prev bought with a creditcard they'll just charge that credit cardt.
richfag who trid to this but with thousands of dollars, i told my bank to block them and they did lol but then they charged a credit card i used months ago and deleted, the 15k
