Who else just randomly received 777 INSP?
A quick google search turned up plebbit as the first results and it turns out that others have randomly received 777 of these for no apparent reason.
I see that there are only 169 holders of a 158508 total supply.https://ethplorer.io/address/0x52903256dd18d85c2dc4a6c999907c9793ea61e3
