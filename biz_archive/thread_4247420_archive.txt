ExchangeN is the next big moon mission.
The exchange project is being done by the same guys who built Yunbi.
The token hasn't pumped and is scheduled to be added to new exchanges very soon.
5.1m circulating supply with the majority of tokens held on HitBTC.
Come hang out in the official EXN Discord where we share correspondence with the developers and general crypto talk: https://discord.gg/Vw9r8aX
and no use case for the token at all...
We speculate it will be used like BNB on Binance to pay transaction fees, or share revenues like COSS or Kucoin.
The exchange project isn't completed so we're hoping the token utility will be revealed simultaneously.
The community for this one is moving mountains already.
