Need 2-3 alt coins for long term.
I don't have time to day trade like you all.
Let's say I have 5k to invest.
Best alt coins to park it for 3 years?
Ethereum, Ark, Omg
Probably NEO since China is the crypto king and they like to boost their national products a lot.
Steemshit pre-mined pajeetshitcoin scam>Doing anything besides dying
EVXwill 10x and still be 1/3 of OMG
k ETH 1k ARK 1k OMG ?????
Honestly, I would put the 3k in Ark and you could start staking it and catching dividends.
But that's just me and I'm a full blow deluded arklet that thinks it will be the crypto equivalent of Google.
FLIK is the new Netflix
Not NEOPut at least 1k in NEO OP
hope you dont believe this image
I don't want to piss on anyones parade but fuck NEO - I don't trust these crafty asians and don't have time to constantly watch the news for when their govt decides to fuck it up again
POWR -- CEO is the mayor of perth, aussie govt recently gave them $8mil to integrate it in the city of fremantleLINK -- big partnerships already confirmed, mainnet on the horizon, way below ATH currentlyNEO -- china
impatient burger has little understanding how new tech is integrated in semi functional cultures
You're going to want to put more than that into ARK.
Staking.
Fuck that Op sell all your NEO
hardware wallets don't make me feel any more safe>it can break>you can lose it or it can get stolen.already massively overvalued.
$8 million grant for $200 M project?
i'd argue it's severely undervalued -- OMG got to $1.2B with ZERO working product while POWR has ties with the australian government & is working hard to implement it in the real world.
it might take a while but i think it has a really huge amount of potential
Need to add Feenix will replace thepiratebay
