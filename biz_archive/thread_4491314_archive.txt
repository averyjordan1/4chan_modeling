Reminder: the people in control of Bitcoin (you are ignorant if you don't think there are powers that control it) could have it worth $10k by December 1 if they wanted.
But they don't.
They have a plan, and a time line.
Every dip is a control mechanism to keep everything on track, and getting too high too quick.
Don't fight it.
Buckle up and enjoy the ride.
Not sure if FUD, or....
So are they also in control of Bitfinex?
That tether hack was all part of their plan?
I think it's more likely there are several powerful groups competing with each other for control.
Yes
This makes more sense.
I'm leaning towards China being the biggest player of them all.
I bet you work for them
Chinese whales.
Is there a term for this infantile type of beliefs in behind-the-curtain powers and conspiracy theories?I understand why people think something massive is controlled, but not whether it's already defined in psychology.
He has a point though.
CHYNA are known currency manipulators
How did you know?
We regularly shill & shitpost on here.
Fuck off
No.You have autism.
was crashing the price part of your plan?
stay ignorant.
I bet you love the smell of your own farts

Although unlikely, it's not impossible someone has control over a cryptocurrency.
I'm not claiming any which way.I'm talking about blindly believing that it is true, which comes close to popular political theories.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_controlThis is pretty close but still not quite it.Folk conspiracies?
Why that?
It's not conspiratory as I understand.
Because it's common for people to believe there's always someone behind the curtains?
Why do burgers come up with a conspiracy theory for literally everything?
Not a burger.
A poutine.
The accepted term for conspiracy theories is “Conspiracy Theory”
