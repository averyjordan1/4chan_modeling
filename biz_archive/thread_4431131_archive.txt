shitcoin with no potential>slow bleedingdont buy it unless you dont like money
You must be stupid not to have some.
I mean 4m$ market cap for something that have potential to be worth billions and just devs alone make me want to throw my money there.
One of the devs saved millions way back for ETH when he worked there.
Then they promised to make livestream of finishing everything IOTA has in it's whitepapre in matter of days, hours even.
Great coin in my opinion.
I think it can go to 20$ this year.
They have whitepaper coming, roadmap, ICOs, airdrops, exchanges, advertisement etc.
And angel investors paid 12$ each coin ...
