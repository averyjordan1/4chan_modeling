corecuck detectedThe prediction is outdatedBitcoin Cash is upgrading its difficulty algo tomorrowhttps://www.bitcoinabc.org/november
If this were true, BCH is basically experiencing hyperinflation, because it's currently being mined at 45 blocks per hour.
That's 450 BCH per hour10800 BCH per day4 million per year-> current inflation rate: 25%
There are btc holders who don't know
Bitcoin will have a difficulty adjustment downwards in 700 blocks anyway.
2 weeks at current rate.
If it would become profitable to mine again it would only take 5 days
Cant believe noobs are still buying Bitcoin Crash
Nice attempt, Roger.
