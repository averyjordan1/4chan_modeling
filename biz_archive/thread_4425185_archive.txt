Looking for a third source of income (short and long term profits) that O can do part time and wanted to see if it would be better to invest into Bitcoin or work part time doing VIP protection/security for high priority personnel.
($25/hr+ depending on task).
Main goal is to make extra 500-1k a month on top of my salary from being in policing and in the army.
Advice?
