Nuls about to moon get the fk in here
I don't know why people are sleeping on this.
this gonna bull rush soon, people are only selling to increase their moved volume for the contest.
Extremely oversold
exactly
Indeed.
I'm not falling for this again.
I'm not even going to look at the price until after the contest is over.
Enjoy missing out on EZ gainz anon.
Why is it so low volume if its gonna be a bullrun?
I'm not missing anything I've been holding since the beginning, but it's not going above a dollar again until this contest ends next week.
