is mining feasible for any coins still right now?
I just my hands on a few recent AMD cards.
Do I sell the cards or see about mining with them abit?
Would I just be wasting electricity and time?
I have a high end computer for some graphic design work I do.
Has a 1080TI card in it and I mine vertcoin.
I do this when the computer is not in use and I get about .7VTC per day.
I was also wondering this too.
I work in IT at my university, and have a source of limitless free power in the back.
If I were to build a mining PC and had it run back there non stop, would that be lucrative?
Doing away with the electricity costs?
how recent?vega is a fucking beast in monero miningpolaris is meh, sell it while they are still in demand
i mined like one zcoin in a week with my 1080 a couple weeks agoi should probably start mining again
 RX580 cards.
would fucking LOVE to mine monero.
how much would 1 of these make in Monero a day?
According to what I'm seeing in 24 hours I'd make around $3?
Is that correct?
Using 1 RX580?
Depends on your local energy prices.
When Ethereum switches to proof of stake, GPU mining is going to be oversaturated with supply.If you don't use these for gaming or you're planning to sell anyway, I'd sell now before the impending mass sell-offs and price crash on polaris GPUs once the GPU mining farms dump theirs on the market and shut down.Forward thinking farms like Alpereum have already shut down and sold.
You better hurry.I warm my room in winter with mining on my 290x that's in a waterloop but I use it for games too and there's cheap electricity here.
I would never get into GPU mining right now.The exception is maybe monero mining with vegas asMentioned.
Monero is likely to keep rising in price and most competition comes from polaris cards that can't really compete on monero anyway.
