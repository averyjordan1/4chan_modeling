what's the best thing to do with my britbong ISA allowance?until now I've been saving as cash with Barclays and something like 0.6% interest rate.
But perhaps a better option is to go all in on stocks (something like vanguard lifestrategy 100% stocks).since it's tax free on gains I ought to be going for the biggest potential gains?
