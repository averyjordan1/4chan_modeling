CTO of IBM did an AMA , saying that big project and partnership are coming up in 2018.This is going to be a moon really hard by January maybe earlier.Get in while you can.
And the Universal Payment Solution, with Stellar, has a vision that goes far beyond just cross-border payments.
I hate saying this because it's not published yet - but more details on this vision will be released very, very soon.
This partnership is not just long term - itâ€™s tight.
Stellar joined the Hyperledger Foundation in addition to partnering on this project.There are many upcoming projects coming up this year about to be announced.
Stay tuned :)
