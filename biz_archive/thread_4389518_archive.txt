Almost, but now my lurking has paid off.
If there are 3 posts about it in /biz/ then it's going to fail, always has been for 3 years.Well 5% of posts are actually correct.It's a great market indicator of what not to buy.
shut up u bich basterd pajeet is real problem
people shilled the shit out of ethereum before it moonedjust as many called it a shitcoin
Atleast 3 posts about it constantly on /biz/ for well over a month, even after it falls 75%.
Last crypto to do that was Ethereum.
Even if you ignore the shilling and memes, literally no other crypto matches ETH other than LINK>first mover>corporate interest and mentions>general use case (applicable to almost any blockchain project)>utility token that fudders say shouldnt increase in value

I'm down 1-3% right now so I wouldn't say I'm being JUST'd

Like eth and neo?
4389728Well, another coin that dropped a lot is DGB and no one at all talks about it anymore.
So in that sense Link is different.
What the fuck did DGB have going for it?
A shitty minecraft mod people mistook for official integration and the citibank competition that they had a terrible chance of winning.
What is it even?
A faster bitcoin?
I was there the whole time and never touched it, stop comparing it to CL
