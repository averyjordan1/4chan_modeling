Anons holding some tether in official tether.to wallets, can you guys send tether let's say to bittrex?
Me and my friend are experiencing the issue as seen on the screenshot every time I click send funds.
Who the fuck is stupid enough to hold tether?
lmao
OP
Anon, you are not helping.
I'm trying to get out from this shit asap.
I'v used tether to accept payments from my clients.
>b-b-but bitfinex said on twitter everything is fine
so it begins.
I'v used tether to accept payments from my clients.
Wow I keep wanting to believe that this tether conspiracy is just /biz/ overreacting again but wow, this really could be the biggest crypto scandal of all time.
dollars>holding tether
It’s obvious it is just the wallet site’s coin daemon being down you dumbshit.
if you hold tethers you literally got scammed out of your BTC with fake money...
j-just a temporary malfunction, e-everything will be fine!
No you didn't and the tether meme is getting old.
do i need to get off any exchange that has tethers?
If you google the error it shows more like an server error rather than a message 'Withdraws restricted".
maybe if I post like a retard people would take me seriously
If you hold fiat you literally got scammed out of your labor/time/precious metals/companies equity/commodity with fake money...
No, I never transfered fiat directly into tether.
I accepted payments in form of USDT from my clients.
I did not convert anything.
If USDT goes down then I'm not obligated to make refunds in any form but USDT only.
So that's at least a positive thing..but still drives me nuts.
