why is this community comprised of, at most 30 people, that post the same thing in every thread?
Do you mean /biz/ or all of 4chan?
because they're NEET autists with nothing better to do
Do you think more people lurk or post?
Why would you lurk on a board that's literally all shill posts?
I can pick out a good dozen different users from their posting styles alone, and that doesn't include the discord posters, pajeet posters, or the bag holding shills
Why wouldn't you?
True, you just get to know some anons over time.
Like that "bitch bastard" linkie
MINISTER YOU, SAT-
Why couldn't they find fit chicks instead of those skinny fatties
Because I like spending time with my friends.
t. Pajeet that spams flippening posts
A sobering post indeed.Farewell.
