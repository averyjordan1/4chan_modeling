Hello /biz/fags.
Newfag here.
What's the best college major for a person who wants to make a lot of money, be lazy, and not work for somebody else's profit?
I want that alpha lifestyle we all crave.
What's a good way to obtain that?
OP again, forgot to mention college is not mandatory, but the way I see it my choices are go to college or be a mcdonalds wagecuck
Drugs
work a shitjob while accumulating burgerbucks>learn how to trade crypto>??
?>either profit or fail horribly
this is true for america not for the rest of the world
Do it yourself then faggot
So learn daytrading is your advice?But isn't that just as time consuming as a regular job and five times as risky?
I never said daytrading.
Simply learn how to make money with crypto.Yes it's risky, but so is being a wagecuck and spending a fuckton of money on college like i did and dont even end up using it.
Step 1: Stop posting your fucking advice threads on /biz/ and lurk until you have something valuable to sayStep 2: Follow Step 1
I hate the Boomer mentality of GO TO COLLEGE OR FLIP BURGERS FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE LAWL!you can climb the ranks of businesses without degrees
