Brandon Kelly is some youtube trader.
On his site, he sells some shit like his top picks and I'm wondering if the picks are legit without throwing down a couple bucks.
Are his picks any good?
Found the profit package he is selling for 25 bucks pic related.
Not a fan.His "boss method" video looks like a legit trading method though if one gets past the fucking ridiculous name.
VERI is a literal scamhe is telling people to buy Dash at this price...a crypto that no one uses is worth = to ether
