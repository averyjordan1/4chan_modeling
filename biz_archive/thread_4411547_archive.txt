w-whales b-botsfucking shitcoin lmao burn in hellso glad I sold at a loss
tfw this once hit 10k satsJUSTmy arms are so sore from holding these bags
Similar thing I saw for NULS awhile back but they were for sell orders.
I think it was to raise the price artificially once it got into these increments.
The one on LINK must be to try to lower it or suppress the price.
Definitely manipulation on Binance, probably happens pretty often
so glad I sold at a lossAnd... you are fucked in the ass if you sold with profit?
my loss was minimal, if I kept holding bags like you deluded faggots tho I would be in the shitter
There is a lot of botting on binance.Like for example I saw a huge buy wall that moved up 1 every second.
muh just hold those dipshits dont understand what you mean
