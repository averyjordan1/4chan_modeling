Strap in boys
I can't remember if I sold mine or not
Me either, or where the fuck itâ€™s stored
THE FUCKING UN?
I found it in my order history.
I bought at 0.0008 and sold at 0.0009
4496232Are you ready for $1, kids?4496291Quick find it.
The HST train got no time to stop!Yes, the motherfucking United Nations.
I bought at like .0012 or some shit when it was shilled here ages ago.Road to breaking even.
(Not actually worried tho since it's a pretty legit coin and going to grow a hell of a lot more)
I bought at 0.0008.
Was down 60% but I'm not worried at all, because this shit's got real potential.And I'm not gonna sell only to break even.
I will sell some at $1.
First of all lets be honest becuase when you lie about this shit it completely turns people away - there's no partnership with the UN.
There is however, an announcement involving them.
That's all that's been discolsed but it sounds promising nonetheless.
What lie?The team's gonna announce their clients in December.
And then the CEO out of the blue said in telegram, that there will be a UN-related announcement.What else do you think it would be?>They had presented HST to the UN in New York.>They have an advisor who is an executive in the UN.Connect the dots.
