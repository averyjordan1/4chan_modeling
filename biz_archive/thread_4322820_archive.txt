Still a sub $10 mcap, still not on a major exchangeNo reason why this won't at least 3x from here
suggesting that $10mil undervalued for an appDude, the ride up was awesome but stop talking people into your bags man.
Just sell to idiots now and move on to actually undervalued projects
There are no bags, it's at ATH and it's been a steady rise
woops, it broke $1 on KuCoin
still trying to FUD the future of P2P crypto commerce
dont be a queer, that volume isnt from BIZ faggotsits real expect 2-3$ price
is it too late to get in now?
buy until $4
Probably.
The guys who got in at ICO are like 25X up.
When will you newfags realise that FUDding doensn't really work on Confido?
tons of them dumped before it even got to 80cents.
is there any way to track if they dumped it?
what was the ico contribution address?
