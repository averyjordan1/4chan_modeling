I really love walton, can you guys fud it down for me so i dont go all inn?
If you love Walton, wait until people find out about pic related
Not buying your bags salty walty
I went in 3 btc on wtc today.
If this shit gets re facto rfid retailers use then God damn
wish i had waited to get in on wtc instead of buying at .00075. bag holdin a bit but not stressing.
see this getting back to around the $8 resistance in the short term
WaBi.
Modum is superior.
Walton has no working prototypes, proof of patents, nothing.
They delayed their launch date at the last minute until some unspecified time in spring 2018.Modum IO is way ahead in production and way undervalued
you want FUD?
Allright.
70 millions coins are sleeping waiting to enter.
More coin= price dump
Blatantly lying with dubs to shill another coin that's already good on its ownAnon..
It has already mooned and nobody gives a fuck about this scamcoin anymore
It just rfid's that can mine and a shit custom blockchain that is literally specific to WTC so you can POW/POS and has "master nodes" (copying dash, typical chink ,no originality) has partnerships with clothing companies no one's ever heard off and has an ex VP is Samsung with (patents) on board an EX meaning he no longer works there, probably fired for scamming or stealing patents.
This coin doesn't deserve to have a market cap that it currently has it's a joke
Walton is a scam and boxmining is paid off.
People pay him off all the time
Where is fucking part 2 video where boxmining talks about tech and block chain not some cleaning lady about shirts?He says I'm uploading part 2 RIGHT NOW at end of video 1.Part 2 never comes out.SCAM BRO!
RIP
