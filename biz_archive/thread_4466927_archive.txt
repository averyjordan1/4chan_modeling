I told you all yesterday when BQX was $1.28 BQX now ETHOSRemember ANT to NEO?We are have our next $1-$30 coin folks.
I predict $60 by EOY
I held this shit for so long was so happy when my Blockfolio alert went off so I could finally dump this shitFuck off suppoman shills
Why would you dump now they will be at $4 by end of next week.
yeah theres totally no way the only reason this coin holds a value is because of suppoman and his group of fucking morons that eat up every word he says think its gods gift to crypto and refuse to sellfriendly reminder people take financial advice from a former minecraft drama youtuber who is a grown man
Also who is Suppoman?
He’s not on the Ethos team anywhere
So you dont want to make money just because some guy you dont like, likes this coin?
Okay then.
He owns 15% circulating supply made YouTube videos shilling it at ICO and ever since he even attempted selling a paid crypto investing guide for $10 that literally just said Buy bqx
Go away mr. Bitquence aka suppoman
I don’t know who that is.
I looked him up, he seems to get the general idea behind BQX/Ethos.
Okay when their wallet launches and they go from $2 to $30 don’t say I didn’t throw you a bone
