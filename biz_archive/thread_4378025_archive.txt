>Bro, this will kill banks and it has lower fees.>This is the future of currency.>Only smart people use it.>this will give the finger to .govHow do we stop this meme?I wanted to spend 40$ and use btc.I didn't feel like sending the recommended fee of 10$ on a 40$ purchase so I made the fee one dollar.Looking a little deeper you find that you also pay a fee so the company you buy from can turn your coin into cash.So now I am looking at a 20$ fee to make a 40$ purchaseNow 3 days later I am sitting with an unconfirmed tx and no purchase.Why did I even bother with paying any fee?Why even bother with btc beyond letting the data rot on a HDD.I really dont think paying a fee to bankers is any better than paying a fee to some faggot letting his machine run.Both do very little work to deserve it.No big surprise though.
Typical human retardation.
I think plebbit would be more up to your speed.
You would fit right in on /r/bitcoin.
Tell them I said Hi!
So... How much eth did money Skelly want for this one?
You are all a bunch of downs syndrome babies,if you think 20$ in fees is a good thing .
because of muh store of value
Should have bought BCH instead.
The BTC developers think long transaction times and high fees are features, good things.
you have to be retarded to not see how this will be the same with eth or any other shit that gets as big as btc.
