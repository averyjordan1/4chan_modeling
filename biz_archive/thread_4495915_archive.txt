The tide is turning brothers.
Most of us knew this would happen.
We knew that we all couldn't make it.
The board is losing hope; a fickle place that could not handle the stress of doubt and uncertainty.
As they leave in higher and higher numbers they will try to latch on to us and take us with them.
They fear the possibility that we stayed and were right while they fled like any sane person would.
I won't let them take me though my link brothers, but I am going into hiding for the time being.
I'm guessing that there won't be many of you left when I return, but for those that remain, stay strong and don't let the darkness blind you from the glorious light at the end of the tunnel.
Godspeed.
