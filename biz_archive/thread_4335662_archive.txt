Yesterday at the height of the bch pump there was suddenly a single 9300 buy order for bch at around 0.49 on kraken.
I was there and looking at this thinking what it was about.
Took about 10-15 mins for that order to be filled after which bch just crashed really hard.Was that part of the pump and dump shenanigans or was that just a rich brainlet wasting his millions?
Not all whales are smart
 Don't worry about it man.Probably just someone with no idea what they're doing.
Wasting millions of dollars.You hodl core, right?Just hang tight dude.
It's almost over.
You realize, he probably just sold and bought into his own order?
Rich whale that misguessed flippening and is a brainlet for having so much on a low volume exchange.
But not as brainlets as you might think.
He knew it would take hours to transfer it to another exchange and he thought the flippening was imminent (it was when it was spiking to 2500) so he did a high price buy order to ensure he got at least 2:1 ratio and wouldn't be stuck with useless btc.To be fair, before bithumb went down it seemed like it might flip within a few hours.
Flippening will happen though so at least he makes maybe 2x.
Unless he panic sells.
He's probably sweating heavy now waiting for big bags of btc to drop from miners, very and Co.
He doubled his btc holding.
Was that it?
but that was the ath price.
I thought it was some sort of effort to stabilize the price or something, to buy time to dump more bch on another exchange
kek was about to say >this but I don't want to lie on the internetnice dubs tho
Actually I went into the pump too yesterday, with the intention of riding the wave.
Tried selling as it started tanking but kraken is so damn shit, the sell order wouldn't go thru even after like 10 tries.
Then it went under my buy in price but I waited until it rose up slightly again to sell.
Luckily I made out with just a slight profit.
Kraken is completely shit tho, pulled all my funds out after that.
Never again.
