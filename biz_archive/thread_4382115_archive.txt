Whats goes up will go down !2 Options:1) BTC fanboys pump it to stay profitable for miners before the dif.
Adj.
strikes.
Should BTC go down under 6000$ its GAME OVER2) BTC gets pumped by BCH fanboys.
Why ?
Shit this will be the biggest dump ever to crash BTC.Prepare, dont be dumb, put stop-loose Orders on your Alts and keep watching BCH.
