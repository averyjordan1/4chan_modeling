You know who to blame, All the core shills.
Go hunt them down.
Frankly this will cause a lot of suicides.
People are doing all kinds of crazy things and losing tons of money in the process, rather than realizing this is simply the nature of the beast.
Oh well.
Weak people die off.
Remember, it's just money
Guess trading is simply not your thing anon.
no sleep tonite bois, this is real.
#BCH is not playing!
