How can we get more normies to buy cryptos?
I will hodl until im a millionaire (own 0.3 bitcoins) so it might take a while.What are good ideas to speed up the process?
The goal has to be that everyone from the 80 year old granny to the 40 something businessmen to the pot smoking teen buys bitcoins.
There are currently around 180 million adresses.
Which would be around only 18 million people.
Those a rookie numbers.
>I will hold until I'm a millionaireIf you become a millionaire with 0.3btc, why the fuck would you want dollar?
By that point crypto would be running the world.
Upvote ATH threads on Reddit so that normies see them on the frontpage.
I'm not even joking.
That always draws them in by the hundreds.
We don't want normies to buy crypto.
Right now bitcoin has momentum since a lot more people with money are FOMO'ing by the day.
We need to let the "bitcoin is going to 4k faggots" and let them all BTFO and rebuy.While that process is happening we make more btc on shitcoins.
The people will go for it when the technology is available
