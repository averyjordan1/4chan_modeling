I heard about RCN when it was listed on Buttrex, had no time to DD, Draper, Pantera Capital and the others investors were a safe bet.And as far as I know they're big in South America and probably one of the only coin with a real purpose.What should we expect on Wednesday?I can't Telegram right now or I would've lurk their Telegram right now, thanks bro.
Alpha being released and real users in Argentina will have access.
they will have access to capital lending right away?
According to their team yes.
sauce please, I'm looking at their roadmap, it only mentions it going live in april 2018, and also something in December
Nice, keep an eye on it, thank you.Hope it goes better than other Alpha releaes (like MTL that tanked).
What up coming news are there for RCN?
Or is there only one in december because I can just buy before then
