HAVE YOU DONE YOUR KEGEL REPS TODAY?
WHAT'S THE POINT OF BEING FLUSH WITH CASH IF YOU CAN'T GET YOUR DONG UP IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY RUN INTO AMBER HEARD OR BROOKE?
thanks again for the reminder man, keep posting.
How should i train this?
KEGELS ARE PERFORMED THE SAME AS STOPPING IN MID PISS.
THAT SAME MUSCLE IS PUMPED AND HELD FOR MORE THAN 10 SECONDS.
THIS WILL STRENGTHEN YOUR PELVIC MUSCLES AND HAVE STRONGER AND CORRECTED ERECTIONS.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7d1z_jJ5woi alternate between long and short intense holds while walking the dogalso focus on elongating the torso and static ab holdsdoing this for 9+ months coupled with noporn and limited fap = dick game out of this world
shit dude thanks it's been forever, been neglecting the kegs
i should also mention this shit can take your squats and dls to the next level
Girls make fun of guys with curved dicks.
I don't think you want a big ol' curve.
Keep it straight and fuck them right.
implying I don't do this every time I tradeMy asshole shrinks to the size of an M&M when those losses hit

Whatever muscle that is is exhausted after holding for just 5 seconds.
