kek.
but that's just like, your opinion, man.
Can I get a Bump?
all on redNo wonder you could never mass even .005 sats.
Reminds me of Neocron.
4439089 years from now... yeah not all that much has changed other than the btc bubble has finally popped/crashed and we use some form of multi-government sponsored coin as we very slowly move towards a 1 government world.btw op those pictures make me want to go read snowcrash and neuromancer again.
Neuromancer is a fucking top read.
I wouldn't mind reading it again actually.
It's been a few years now since I read it.
ya its an ok book, I wasnt really into gibsons writing style but he had unique enough ideas to keep me reading... probably 5 years since I read that book.
been a bit over a decade for me.
I just remember thinking at the time that without that book, and the movie dark city, the matrix probably wouldn't have been made.
I havent seen dark city, but I might have to go watch it one of these days.
Good movie, I really like it, for whatever that is worth to you.
Only the world governments and some very wealthy personal individuals own any larger than 1 whole BTC.>>You can buy an entire village in Venezuela for 4000 Satoshi’smuh dick
good point, and well constructed argument.
