This is going to be a harsh day for btc.
A harsh week, a harsh month even.
But btc will survive.
And when it does, it's going to moon.
Hell, moon is a short word; it's going to infinity and beyond.
Remember, what doesn't kill us , make us stronger.
Just curious.
How will the current affairs affect those oldfags that still happen to hold the very old BTC from like 2013 or so?
Do they kind of own the both chains?

Big bang theory is airing an episode on the 20th based solely on Bitcoin.
But even with that I don't think it will affect price much.
I remember when I had like .8 BTC and it costed me $60, spent it on silkroad lol
yes, their keys will work on all the chains that forked later than they bought it
