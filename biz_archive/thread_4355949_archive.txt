Am I doing good?
that's good IF you can maintain that, and yes, there are people who can.
never fall for the "no one can beat the market" meme.
That's pretty good if you can mange risk well.
Looks like you're going to make it anon.
This is my another account, with more aggressive style.
Paper trading with 1,000 but I need more confirmation before I put 10,000 into this bot
oops forgot pic
Thanks anon, I'll level headed and not be too greedyI hope so too!
we all want to go to lambo land
wait, is this paper trading?
because it would completely nullify your results, if somindset changes completely when you see that you're losing real fucking money

Yes it's paper trading, but I'm testing a daily trading bot so I need to run the test for longer.
I'm trying to put 10,000 into both accounts.
what program is that one that tracks trades?
I don't know how to do this and I don't want others to be successful with it.Also, OP, don't forget to count in fees in case you didn't.
I'm bad at moon missions but daily trading, I'm pretty comfortable with.
Yea, both accounts with .25% bittrex fees.
without the fees, I would have already put my life savings into the bot lol
ok, sorry man, but most people are able to perform extremely well under demo conditions, because the risks you don't feel realalthough, seeing as it's a bot, im not sure what will happen once you use it with real money
