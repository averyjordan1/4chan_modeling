i'm not sure on the specifics of this kind of stuff, just a simple trader, but i've thought about this toowhy couldnt they co-exist in harmony, just like that?

It would be much more easier to just have one of them so you don't have to switch between them.
BCH has the same capped value as BTC: 21 million.
So they have the same capability to be a store of value.
regardless of what you think is better how can you justify holding btc in this situation where there is a certain bch price where all hashpower will leave the btc chain and never return meaning you will not be able to sell
