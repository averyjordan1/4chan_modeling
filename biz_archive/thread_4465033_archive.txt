I mean its pretty much confirmed it has nothing to do with the government.
But it seems NEO holders are still expecting a Microsoft partnership which most likely will be announced.But Microsoft is also partnered with a shit ton of crypto like Tierion, Zcash, ETH, etc.
Why are people so bullish for a Microsoft partnership?
Its literally nothing special.
Eh, it'll be a quick pump anyway so I'm happy.
Then this is a confirmed pump and dump?
