Hey senpai, im the same anon who told you to buy OCL last friday.
See At that point Oceanlab was under $0.05c and like i said OCL did indeed go to the moon.
Yesterday it even went to $0.07c.
If you had listened you could have made a 40% profit over the weekend.Anyway, I'm now back to tell you to buy the dip.
OCL is dirtcheap and is getting ready to go for another round one of these days.
Its still ridiculously undervalued and is going into orbit (x10) once it gets listed.
BTC has the headlight now but as soon as it dips OCL is the #1 altcoin you will be wanting to buy.
OCL will easily move past $0.1 this week and is going to continue to rise well past $1.
Dont say i didnt warn you senpai!
If you're looking for another moon mission, this is it!!
Dont be left on earth while everyone else is going to the moon.
