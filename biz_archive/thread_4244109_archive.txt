Please.
I can not take any more of this.
No more ICOs, no more coins, no more tokens, no more fud, fomo, shilling or pink wojaks.
It is relentless.
I have become a broken human being.
Every refresh of biz I have either made the worst decision of my life or failed to grab the best opportunity of my life.
I can feel it, I'm not going to make it.
hard game, hard winners
pretty much this, i bought into all of the icos that tanked and didnt participate in confido even though i was whitelistedJUST
Play stupid games.
Win stupid prizes.You could say the same thing about missing out on +1,000% gains on Amazon, Apple, Netflix, or Google.
Nobody can predict the future, don't try to think you can, just make the best bet you can.
