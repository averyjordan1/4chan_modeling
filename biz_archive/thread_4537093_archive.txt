I'm slowly investing in NEO/GAS right now, daytrading and using the profit to buy more GAS/NEO.I have a feeling there's something true about the Chinese rumors.If you think about it, logically, no country has yet to adopt a crypto as "it's own", have China force all cryptotrading to be on NEO and voila, they'll have a third of the cryptomarket in no time.
are you working for chinese government
Which I think will spark a revolution in terms of countries adopting currencies as their own, BTC or whatever it settles at will obviously become the crypto of the US.
I think the rest of Asia will follow NEO and Europe as a whole will adopt one, with like Israel adopting the same as US or something.
Government shitcoin/BRAAAAAP
3 blessings of a lifetime
Europe as a whole isnt going to do shit.
We all hate the EU and we have a civil war against the muslims coming up.
And the muslims will win.
Nah, at least in Germany we have experience in dealing with religious minorities.
Sucking their cocks.
