It's been years since I got out of mining, and with everyone banging on about coins I just dumped a couple grand into a few to see what happens, but a friend of mine kept insisting that mining is still (now) profitable (again).I brushed him off, but fuck me this shit's good!My old gear would get back around $5 for every $20 of electricity, but shit's nearly 10x as efficient, so PROFIT!
(Plus, I just so happened to have a 36KW solar setup installed on my roof, so it wouldn't even matter)So I look up grabbing a miner, a S9 or R4 look breddy gud (going for an R4), but it's the EXACT SAME FUCKING SHIT AS WHEN BUTTERFLY LABS GOT IN, HERE'S SOME SHIT, PREORDER AND GET IT IN MONTHS, MEANWHILE DIFFICULTY HAS GONE UP SO MUCH IT'S ALL FUCKED BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVE!Can't believe shit's still the same, motherfuckers not just stocking up on gear and selling it as they have it.I wanna get in on this shit NOW, not wait till fucking January.
WHERE can I get an R4 NOW, and how much is it gonna cost me?
EbayAlsoTry searching for Avalon 741 miner.
Also your gonna need 240V 20amp to get that bitch running.
Nice story.
Now back to r/cryptocurrency please
Plus, I just so happened to have a 36KW solar setup installed on my roofNo you don't.
Can't find shit on ebay, guess I'll just scoop up any S9's I seeI've got a 240v 150amp inverter anon, that won't be a problem.I've been afk for the last 5 years anon, you have no idea how many tax cuts this gave my business.
But selling to the grid for 5c/kw?
Fuck that noise, I'd rather burn every last bit of it mining.
Listen here, sonny jim, I was shitposting about crypto on /g/ LONG BEFORE /biz/ was ever a thing, I remember when this board was created to contain the doge begging, when three quarters of the posts on /g/ where about altcoins.Don't YOU fucking tell ME to fuck off, YOU fuck off!
