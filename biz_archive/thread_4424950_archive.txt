million USD extracted and rollbacked to safe investment.
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.

You only gotta correctly call the coin that will take over BTC/BCH one day.
It's just that easy
it is for poorfags like us.
Sell the LINK op.
Gamble on a more secure coin like BCPT
Don't worry anon.
We're gonna make itAt least I'll keep telling myself that
We better or I'm going to columbine the lot of you.
I'm gonna shill the fuck out of a coin in 2018 that I think might actually become a top currency and potential BTC dethroner and I'm taking you all to lamboland or to the grave with me
Go on...
