If you're supposed to pay taxes on cryptocurrency transactions the same way you would pay taxes on stocks, how are we supposed to use it as an actual currency for everyday things?
Do they expect us to keep track of every single transaction and tabulate it at the end of the year on tax forms?
and then btc crashes to 1.2k in may
before computers, the only people who traded stocks were the wealthy.
Thats in part because those are the only people who could afford to hire accountants to do their taxes, keeping track of every single transaction and tabulating it at the end of the year on tax forms.
Now, all i have to do is hit one button and all of my transactions are imported into trubotax.
OP, i recommend you hire an accountant.
You're not special because crypto exchanges are behind the curve on taxes.
Thankfully I only did one crypto->fiat this year and no crypto->crypto, so it should be easy for me to figure out how much to report.
But I'm talking about using cryptocurrenies to buy regular shit like gas or lunch at a cafe, which a lot of the early shills said we would eventually be doing regularly.
How will we ever reach that point if the tax reporting is going to be a logistical nightmare because of how crypto is classified?
