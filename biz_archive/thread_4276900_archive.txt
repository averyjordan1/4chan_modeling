SingularDTV is the worst name ever.
No one in Crypto has a name as confusing / trying-to-be-clever2.
The website looks like it was created by The Situation from Jersey Shore3.
Their projects are pretty awesome.
Might not be the next Walton or Adex, but I feel like I could create my own stuff on here and make $$$ ...whereas half the other coins are arbitrage ( I don't game, play online poker, or deal with smart contracts )
Look at the order book.
We're about to absolutely run
