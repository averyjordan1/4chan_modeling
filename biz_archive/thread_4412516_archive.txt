pussy ass money don't make no profit.
time to buy this LINK dip.
we got real, life changing technology on our hands.
stop being stupid n short sighted.
stop thinking you can just hop from shitcoin moon mission to shitcoin moon mission.
ya gonna get burnt, dummy.
instead, park yo money where it belongs: in the fuckin system that's gonna connect all this crypto shit to the real world.
can you even fathom the amount of money this thing gon be worth when literally EVERY smart contract that uses external data has to go through the chainlink oracle network?shit man, this could literally make BTC and ETH look like jokes.
mere preludes to the amount of money we LINKers make.
BUY LINK.
this dip is fucking sweet as hell.
mad props to anyone who was lucky enough to buy below 2000 sats.
you are the godly ones among us.
I hold 60k+ LINK that was once worth 8 bitcoins, now not even worth 2.
This team has botched everything since the ICO scandal.
