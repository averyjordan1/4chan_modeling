Where do you see Vertcoin EOY?I bought some at $5.83 and I'm starting to regret it.
Why did you buy the absolute ATH?
lol that's even hard to chieve
it will probably go back down to 2 or 3 dollars for a while.
it's had quite the run

I DON'T FUCKING KNOW WHY IT'S PLAIN BAD LUCKAND I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CONFIDO AND VTC AND I CHOSE VTC

Lol just wait it out then.10$ EOY.
it's cause u got greedy and held instead of shorting.

Could be $10 if nothing else screws up the market.
One of my most comfy holds.
