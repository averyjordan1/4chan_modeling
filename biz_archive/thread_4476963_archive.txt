Which would you choose?>You make it, nobody else on /biz/ does>We all make it!>Nobody makes it.>Everyone on /biz/ makes it except you.Let's see your chaotic evil minds at work, there is no doubt that outside of this hypothetical, the first is the only option, as I'm sure every single one of you would murder and eat your own family for a couple of bucks.
I'd like to everyone make it.
If I had to choose between you guys or me though, sorry boys.
only I make it.
If everyone makes it, I wont be able to dump since everyone else is also dumping.Also, it may effect the mutual funds that I plan to invest my /madeit/ money into if there is an influx of cash pouring in
Don't have to choose.
Option 1 is already a reality.
We all make it except corecucks and linkies
The first one, this will please me a fucking lot, I can laugh and boast all I want and kick down the people on this fucking board.
AHAHAHAHAHA, I'm already pleased by the amount of people losing their money already and making bad investment decisions.
They deserve it for being so STUPID.
I want them to keep losing their money so I can laugh at them and gain more money off their losses.
I'm an experienced trader and most people don't know shit about how to trade right and they spout so much bullshit and they lose money, good makes me happy when they post their losses on this board everytime.
