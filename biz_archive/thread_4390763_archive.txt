Any promising, upcoming ICOs?
Blockstack is tomorrow.
stay away from blockstack.
huge cap for current market conditions.
try to find the good ones under 1m cap.
Do not mention ICO's here until whitelisting is over.
This way cap allocation will not be influenced by /biz/ fags.
I get it anon but I think sharing good ones among us could be helpful.
Sure some will just hop on.
Also its late night biz, not many will see anyways.
late night>Thinks the majority of /biz/fags are burgersThink again anon, it's 9 in the morning
