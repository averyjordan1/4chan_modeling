Over $7k by morning, liquidate your alts or get JUST'd.
If you bought BCH, liquidate yourself.
>$6780>over $7k
FUCK YEA!Up we go, motherfuckersJust touched 6800 babyBCH'ers are such retards, this is pure comedy I swear

Why is it going up again?Is it really finished dipping already?
Lets look a bit closer.
The green is the larger trend shown on the first chart.
The purple is the local trend from the last few days.
Will it break from the local trend and then the larger trend?I think not, but we shall see.Love,Lain
Do you believe it'll spike to a new ATH, similar to how it did 2-4 or stay at this current level and dip as it did in 1-2?
shut the fuck up.
what is this game of thrones larping shit.
Hail to the KING!welcome back Sir!
BTC is gonna death spiral they saidBCH's new difficulty algo is gonna steal away all the miners they said
No amount of TA can help you when you have a conflict such as we've had with BCH, anything could happen and past performance has absolutely zero value in a face off.
Looks like the war is over and we're on back on trend but I wouldn't count my chickens just yet
