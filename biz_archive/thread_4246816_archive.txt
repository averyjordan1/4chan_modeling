FUCK YOU /biz/, this is the last time I buy into one of your P&Ds
Literally what?
It was 0.4$ yesterday and now 0.6$.
It's clear you're the one fucking up.
he didn't buy into the ICOFuck I feel comfy right now
How TF is this a pump and dump?
It's fucking DNT all over again!
How long until "buttrex when goys"?
Put 0.2 into ICO, walked away with 3 eth - enjoy getting dumped on nerds this product isn't actually going anywhere fast.. there won't be any other exchanges for a good while
I tried reasoning like in this thread: But the legions of ADHD millennial retard with severe cases of FOMO don't listen to reason.ICO was a good buy.
Buying at x15-20 is not.
They have to learn the hard way.
Nobody is buying.
Except DNT is on Bittrex kek
OP you bought something knowing it just went x14, you can't blame anyone but yourself.
This is a shitcoin, enjoy the dumping phase.
I can't even access retardelta to sell this shit, JUST
why the fuck do you buy something that has pumped x14 in one day
People who couldnt buy the dip = People who sold early = FUD :)
Anybody who buys bitcoin now is an idiot - it went x1,000,000!
biz will never learn xD xDsame with ethereum: x300 since last year - people still buying
Did eth pump x13-x16 in one day?
What happens after a pump?
Is this shit comparable to eth?
I respect you for your ability to give serious answers to obvious idiots/kids without at least 3-5 insults.
patient boy, it still has low marketcap.
Remember when Ethereum went up like $150 in 2 days?
Guess what happened right after.
Really, take a guess
The supposed team is literally only one guy, have fun bagholding for life, you fell for all the pajeet scammers
clueless
