ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER DIP!
I am actually glad that the crypto market is contracting.
Since this means that it will be easier for me to buy all of these coins at cheaper prices.But you guys are being total babies, just you wait and give it a few weeks and BTC will return to its normal price.
And honestly just look at how much it increased since mid august.
It doubled in value.
And with all of the dips it is yet to drop below that.
