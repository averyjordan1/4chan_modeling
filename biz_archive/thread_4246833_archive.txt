I've been holding bags some exchanging and trying icos and i'm up double to triple with little effort in a since MarchThat's just not good enoughWhat the upcoming fork has done is give me an opportunity to nearly force me to sell all my assets back into BTC for the fork, because why give away free coins?
That said I'm not holding anymore even for that day.
When I realized that a huge weight came off my chest.
I wasn't stuck emotionally any more to anything even BTCFrom now on I don't give a fuck about shit except for SALT and LTCLTC I'm using as my tether, why because it's design concept from the beginning was to be the silver to btcs gold, it's faster cheaper undervalued and will mostly climb or have reasonable bottoms SALT I'm stacking because I'm going to take out loans so I'm loading up nowEverything else I'm trading day to day selling at a 5 - ?
?% increase into something else with trading volume at one of the better % drops on the day taking into account the actual asset underlying value as psychological floor for the market.Fuck bag holding unless you personally believe in the company or somethingUnburden yourselves guys
