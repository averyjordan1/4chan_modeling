 usd have you dumb fuck thought about what market cap this implies?Eth has 20 times more devs than eth, business support, working groups, foundations set up, way more innovative than link, and went from 10 usd to 330 in 2 years.
Ok I keep this goingNothing has happened for weeks, or months(?).
Except downwards trend..20$ Dec 1.25$ Jan 11$ 2019

I have to ask.
Why is this coin being shilled so much?
What's so special about it?
I'm not attacking it.
Genuinely want to know what's up.
Well it went 30x so 1B to 30b.So 64mil market cap on ChainLink would be less than 2B which is totally attainable, especially when whole crypto market rose like +100b this year.
Now it's 200b, maybe 500b in 2018
deluded moon mission idiotsi went to youtube and watched sergey talk for a min.

Pls mention "link" in the op so I can filter it.Thanks!
uhmm..You have december and january two times in your list.
There is only one month a year so thats not correct.also i think $20 per link next year!
Anon...
Growth will not be so linear, welcome to cryptospace.It will explode, have selloffs, explode even more, fall back to some random BTC/ETH drama, fall back even more, explode again, etc.
My prediction $1 before sibos $5 after presentation $10 by November Oh wait... LINKIES BLOWN THE FUCK OUT FOREVER

DAILY REMINDER> The Top 100 holders collectively own 76.81% (768,135,262.54 Tokens) of ChainLink Token Tokens>Total Supply: 1,000,000,000.00 Tokens>Total Token Holders: 13717Source: https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca
Other relevant data, on Lambos to give you an idea:>As for the Gallardo, despite 2013 being its last year on the market, 1,120 units were sold, bringing the total tally of sales over its 10-year life to 14,022 units.If you combine the two metrics of Lambos sold per year and top 100 link holders, basically all I can come up with is, if you are a Link holder and you don't already own a Lambo I got bad news for you
made video at peak of 10k sats >link trading below ico btc value Lmao
Pajeets will keep FUDing while LINKERS will prevail

I'm having difficulty finding a valuation for this coin.CME adopts chainlink to execute their derivatives contracts because its more efficient to do it automatically.the cost of buying or selling a contract ranges from $0.10 to $1.00.
so we'll say $0.20.Chainlink makes the system say 20% more efficient.
Chainlink then captures... maybe 10% of that fee.
$0.02 per trade goes to chainlink, there are 4 million contracts per day on CME, that's $80k per day, and there are $1 Billion chainlink so each chainlink should gain $0.00008 per day in value.i know its all screwed up but this is the best I havethis guys analysis is even more retarded than mine.
He compares it to the market cap of discover?
WHY???
they don't even do remotely the same thing.
well, it is still better than toilet memes to value the coin
It "links" the data Smart Contracts need to be executed in a descentralized way, which implies they will be tamperproof and secure.
This way, shit like general banking, loans, betting, can trust the blockchain to adopt smart contracts.This is revolutionary tech and will make a before and after in general business and maybe in whole mankind.
The question is if ChainLink will be the first company to do it, or if someone else will.
So far they have the head start and that is why it's shilled so much.
Wishful thinking everywhere
