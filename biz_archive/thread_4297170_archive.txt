what's the difference between address and compressed address?
why do they both share the same private key but when i click them they have completely different transaction/btc in storage?
compressed addresses make the bitcoins smaller so more can fit in a block
Compression is like zipping files.
They become smaller thus more data can fill in the blockstream and node endpoints will have an easier way of decrypting the checksum for integrity.
4297189aren't they both public keys?and if they both share the same private key then shouldn't they share the same transactions?
bump


My private key is somewhere on that database, in the first 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 pages, and I have over 500 BTC on it.I challenge you guys to find it.
please it is a simple question.
need answers.
Compressed addresses got squashed now they are smaller
my question is why the compressed address and normal address show different transactions in them.
are they two different wallet?
how can they share the same private key but not the same account??
I don't know exactly but what I do know is each private key has many public addresses(not sure how many), but no private key shares the same public addresses.This is why when you setup a wallet you can toss away used addresses after each transaction.
Compressed address only store x coordinate of a point on elliptic curve and a sign of y coordinate.
It is enough to get i coordinate from curve equation.
Uncompressed address (or actually public key it's based on) stores both x and y.
Because transactions are send to public key anon... All of them are accessible with same private key though.
When you create a wallet, it will be created either compressed or uncompressed, so you shouldn't be using compressed and uncompressed public keys for same private key.
