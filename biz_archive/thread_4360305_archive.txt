Dumping your bags in 20?
My heaviest bag.
Unironically bought this at the ATH.
Still HODLing.
It has bottomed out.
I don't believe you.
do you think that's enough to get rid of your bags you bought at 800 sat?
Nothing :D
SiacoinHUGE overpriced
Underrated
lol i remember when it was around 2 cents.
the market cap would have to be fucking astronomical for this to get much higher than that.
kek
It hasn't bottomed out until it hits 20 sat.
same here brother.Won't sell until i at least salvage 25k
I'm 10,000 Sia deep.
If it ever makes it to dollar land I'll be happy.
But I feel like it has real utility as a feature technology crowd sourcing peer to peer file sharing with monetized incentives.
So one day those 10k coins are taking me to lamboland.
Don't say I didn't warm you.
Circulating Supply: 30,864,872,409 SC>A dollar a coin>Projected Market Cap: $30,864,872,409Sometimes I wonder if /biz/ is filled with 15 year olds
See you there friend.
Can't say you didn't warm me
.8 billion isn't that unrealistic.
In 1 year, BTC MktCap will be close to a trillion, ETH 500 billion.
I don't see why Sia couldn't be 30.8 billion (it won't, but I'm saying that there's nothing technically stopping it)
No, just anglo-saxons and pajeets.
Hypothetically, sure.
But SIA is a utility coin.
It serves one purpose, and the market in which the purpose is served is limited to begin with, and even then, is dominated by big money and big players.
A niche file hosting coin is not going to reach almost 1/3rd of BTC's market cap.
It's just never happening.
Wow OP that was a great pump went up a good 3 satoshi's.
bottomed outno that was burst
