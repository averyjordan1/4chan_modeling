You're going to be millionaire in few years, keep holding.
hi deepak is that you?
You are absolutely going to make it, OP.
If you don't, none of us will, because it would imply a crypto crash coupled with a radically newer technology overtaking the whole space in a flash.
You'll make it OP.
100 ETH and 1 BTC will probably be worth several hundred thousand in 5-8 years time.Just HODL.
