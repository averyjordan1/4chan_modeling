Why is no one talking about the current moon mission?
its the latest and greatest biz meme, the silent wojakkkk
Because it will bleed out shortly again... No real news got out and that for the pump is without a fundamental reason.
Sergey is literally a santa.

the pump is without a fundamental reasonSo was the bear trend over the past 5-6 weeks.
Rory said there would be news this december
lol already back at the bottumwhat a shame
The fundamental to the bear trend was, that they were unable to even give a little hint to the market any actual NEWS would break the trend.
What you are seeing now is another anticipation to the devs putting out news that might be seen positive.
But the thing is, that the upcoming news that will be announced might sound like big steps from ChainLink POV but the greater majority of holders (including me) might be disappointed by the little steps this project makes with a financial turbo boost of 32mil$
cant wait for the christmas treats hes bringing out
The fundamental to the bear trend was, that they were unable to even give a little hint to the market any actual NEWS would break the trend.They did a major event, and then indicated exactly what they were going to be working on along with a general timeframe.This along with the names directly connected to the project should have at least sustained Link at a high price level.Instead it tanked as if the Swift CEO personally shit in Sergey's cornflakes in a live CNN feed during prime time.
