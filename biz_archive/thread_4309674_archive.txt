What...
Wait, HOL UP.You be telling me.... there are people on here RIGHT NOW who sold their Bitcoin Cash for Bitcoin Core back in August and didn't just keep both to see which one would succeed?
People couldn't sell BCH because nobody was buying, moron.
I bet they're happy now, though.It was a total shitcoin up until yesterday.
Total.
Shitcoin.
How did this happen?
It doesn't make any sense!
It was trading at $600+ in August you nigger.
