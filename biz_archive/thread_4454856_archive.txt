Whats the forecast for this shitis it worth keeping or dumping
It reminds me of Stratis just before it bled the next three months from its $10 high.
/biz/ hates lsk and will tell you to sell it because they are a bunch of deluded arkies.
im going to hodl both of my lsk and ark.
i am hoping that btc corrects soon or at least between 8-10k then btc will rush back into altcoins.
so its possible that on the next euphoric wave of btc alts dump more but imo we are nearing the bottom desu but then again im a shit trader because ive lost nearly my entire life savings falling for the day trader meme
Long term hodl
/biz/ doesn't draw a fucking line like every other person on the planet...
So they think a 'dump' is the end...Wow...
So fucking hard to draw one fucking line.
LOL someone got P&D'd
