>missed the BTC dip again
Don't worry, if you really want to buy BTC, there will be another dip to 4k in the next 24 hours.
Feel free to buy the dip there since you're clearly a sheep who likes losing money.

The chink and jew-gook have made off with your money already, there is no more pump to be had.
