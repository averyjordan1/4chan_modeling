My mom got herself into a pyramid scheme.
What do I do?
Is she already balmed in or?
If she isn't you might get her out of this and smuggle her over the border.
try to fuck her
Tell her to sell her mETH.
It's a site called Crowdfunding International.
Her dumbass friend got her into it.
She hasn't pulled anyone else in.
The bitch running it is behind 2 ponzi schemes already.
I figured you were triggered by a mlm company.
Looks like you are right.
Slap the shit iut of yoir moms dumbass friend and get her out of there.

Yeah, that's basically what I found.
Seems like the only way to delete the account is by sending them an email.
Is deleting the account and getting out asap enough?
Like is there another base I need to cover?
