Why is there no aeternity thread?
This shit has a solid everything and has been mooning since phase 1 5 cent ico, it's literally the next ether and the flippening is gonna make us all rich.If you don't have 10k ae what are you even doing?
This coin is $5 by eoty, $50 by 2019 and $300+ by 2020, buy 3k and be a millionaire already.

Right there with you - bought at .41c after a shill awhile ago and noticed how it consistently preformed.
Just steady and up, no signs of serious manipulation.
I'm excited for this coin yet I hardly know it
