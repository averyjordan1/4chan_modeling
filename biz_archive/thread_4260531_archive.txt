Okay /biz/ >be me yo, move out of parents house to Tallahassee with older 22 yo brother.>have 42 college credits from dual enrollment and 3k in the bank>put off college cuz it's overpriced, propaganda filled and feel overall it's pointless since everyone else has someone else to paying for it.
>lose hope, start smoking tons of weed.>get into a fight with my older brother who is the definition of a easily offended millennial who drives a smart car.
>Decide he needs to be put into his place and throw him to the ground.>call him a baby cuz he cant even cook for himself>he runs to the front door and yells for the cops>OH SHIT, pull him back inside cuz he's a retard.>go to jail for domestic battery and kidnap.
What gives?
Im really bullish on crypto, spent months lurking and learning all that i can.
My goals are to get rich, invest in condos and retire early but i gotta deal with all this bullshit going on rn.
Im working with a dude who lives in a warehouse doing handy work, plumbing etc.
Really enjoy it but the work varies and isnt steady since he isn't legally licensed to do any of the work he offers.
Wanna learn how to work on cars too cuz it's a good skill to have.
Contemplating joining the Army National Guard but honestly dont even want to do that, but know i should.
Living with my elderly parents in a small retirement community.
I asked around and the only jobs people said were around here were landscaping and walmart soooooo...... Do i stay with my parents and be comfy living for free?
or try my luck with the Army.
If any of you are NEETS and/or in the military what are your opinions.
