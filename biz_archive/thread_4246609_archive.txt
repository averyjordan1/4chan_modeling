is there any chance for the Aragon(ANT)?
It's brutal, but it was obvious because they are friends with ((Bancor))
Ant is ahead of its timeTruth is there's no reason to hold ant in hopes for widespread use in 2020+ since your investments in btc or eth will likely skyrocket by then if we live in a world where ant is widely used

ICOcuck here.
I canâ€™t even tell you how fucked up my shit is.
