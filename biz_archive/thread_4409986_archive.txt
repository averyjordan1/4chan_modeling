Yes, I got email from coinbase that the S2X is still on the way.
If support for the fork remains at current levels or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable.
Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets.
Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
Does it has replay protection?

Consensus is at 28%....
It would be absolutely retarded to di this....right?Or maybe they are planning it as an attac on btc so that they can pump btrash again?
as long as 1 miner is signaling fork there will be a fork of some kind.
the question will be if there will be enough miners to make it a viable coin and if so, if they will continue to support it.
