anyone else FUD their own coins for fun?
yes I do some times, if I want to buy more.
This happens with link on daily basis
karma will get back at you idiot
i dont say anything unless someone happens to bring it up.Then i FUD the shit out of it.
DEVILISH
All the time.
If my shitty FUD doesn't get BTFOed decisively, I sell my stacks.
Why hold something that has no counters to the hysterical FUD from a NEET.
Maybe.
Who's asking?
Can someone ELI5 what FUD is?
Fear, uncertainty and doubt.It's done to send the price down.
All linkers FUD link as a sport.
The toilet memes are one of the best things that happened in this board in a long time
Yes I FUD req daily

This, FUD is a good litmus test for the perceived value of a coin.
I FUD ETH like crazy even though I hold a moderate stack.
Not because I want to buy low (eth is too big to fud on /biz/ anyway), it's just so fun.
most of the Ark Fud pastas and memes are made for fun by the ark community
I come to /biz/ purely for the psyops element I get from it, baiting people into second guessing themselves is fun.
I gobble up many small transactions doing this, sometimes I place signals into my posts that I hope other oldfag biztards see and get.
Though I'll be honest last few months really has made this place take off into a new direction, its much easier to do this.
I hope these people understand how much their going to lose, its like newfags come in, lose money, FUD their bags, sell at loss, then leave.
They don't understand the art.
People who understand this are creating a new secret order, and you wont believe its in front of you because its fucking 4chan.
Yeah.
Don't buy LNK, its the next Confido.
Exactly the same pattern except with less PR.
