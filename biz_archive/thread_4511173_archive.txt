https://etherdelta.com/#PBL-ETH
why would anyone use this page?
it looks like shit
you can trade any shitcoinI can make a token in ten minutes and have it trading immediately
My dream is to be fast enough to one day snag a buy order like that.
Why are you looking at my transaction.
Look at the top of the order book
You can set Bid price along with token # manually like in every other exchange, however unlike most exchanges, ED will not automatically refit your order to the optimal bid in the order book like on Bittrex, so if you fuck up the numbers, you're fucked.This particular individual, let's call him Lenny Loose Ass, bought 0.001 of a token at a price of 11000 ETH per 1 token, costing him nearly 7 ETH, or ~$2500 for 0.001 of a token that is trading at pennies currently
