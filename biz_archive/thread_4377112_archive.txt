So LSK has been up and down more times than a bride's nighty, but this month's it's been on a steady increase.
Looking at the history it looks like an easy gain - for the next few days/weeks at least.I'm not sure what to look out for in a crypto, I just surf patterns, so is LSK fundamentaly any good?
Does it have potential to moon or is it a pnd?
