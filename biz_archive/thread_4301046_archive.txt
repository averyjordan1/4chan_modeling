Explain to a brainlet how the fuck do you actually make money on altcoins?
Lets say you've made some profits on a coin and you want to cash out, but that'd require to trading it to bitcoin.
But what if the bitcoin has tanked since your initial buy and trade of bitcoin to altcoin, wouldnt that just result in losses, when you cash out?I bought btc at 6.8k and traded it to alts, and since then my btc balance has increased, but usd decreased, but what's the fucking point, if e.g.
btc tanks to 5k, wouldnt that only result in losses in terms of fiat, unless I've made some overly insane gains on alts?!

Or stable coins like ETH.
Who cares about FIAT, you've to make gains in terms of BTC

you're only losing money if the currency your assets are invested in decreasesinb4 i took the bait
Jesus Christ talk about short sight.
Thats the point.
Why were people spamming hoping that bitcoin crashes, when it was going over 7k, when they themselves have assets in it?
my guess is they want a fast crash to buy around 3-4k and then smugly resell at 7k 2 days later
Because many people, including me, sold at around 7.5k to rebuy lower.When BTC goes on a bull run you sell your alts for BTC and then sell BTC for FIAT after the usual double top (pic related).You won't make moon-like gains but you keep your money and profit is pretty much guaranteed.
