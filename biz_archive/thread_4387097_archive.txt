mate don't listen to these retards just do what you think is right.
For the next big dip and park it in coins u think are good.
Fiat
ETH
NEO will be going up a lot in the next few months, generates GAS for comfy passive gains, and like a lot of coins is on a big discount right now.
But basically anything will give you gains right now.
Bitcoin Cash.
Big announcements brewing.
What is this coin?
