Sitting on 600, really want to increasy my baby stack.
Also think this is a hidden goldmine
What is this supposed to be and why will it be big?
It looks like some kind of crypto investment company where experiences users at as brokers while inexperienced users put up funds.
It does that.
It brings transparency to that big industry, mixs crypto and stocks.
It also will bring "funds" like ICN, but with a lot lower coin quantity and market cap.
It also has charlie shrem as an advisor, and app already works.It should, at least, have ICN market cap, which is like x12.
Easy profits.
