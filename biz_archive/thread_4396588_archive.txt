So I bought decred at 500k sats and 470k sats, bought a total of 0.05304728 worth and if I sell now I'll lost aobut $45 should I sell and cut the loss?
My total portofilo is around 0.5 btc
No, lightning network end of the month.
What the fuck is $45 in cryptoworld you dipshit.
If you are the type to panic sell when things drop by $50 or $100 in one day then go fuck off and put ur money in the bank instead.
Crypto is not for you
I've double my money from 2 weeks already, I've dodged big bullets by pulling out fast and cutting my losses when I'm 4% down already.
Its just that for decred I was sleeping while BTC rallied and now I don't really know what to do if I should take this big loss...
.05 is like 10% of your portfolio, i wouldnt be worried desu.
You can sell now but you are effectively trusting BTC to reach ATHs again.Look at BTC and decide.
If BTC hits 8k everything will dip.
If BTC dips back to 6k alts will rise 20% in like 2 hours.
You need to be on the ball if you want to catch that wave.
No point selling now, it won't go much lower and it will definitely get a pump with Lightning Network.
Lots of good stuff coming for this coin.
