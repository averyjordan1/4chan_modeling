FUEL just listed on Binance, it is below ICO price, does anon know anything about this project?
I know one thing - I have no idea how it could go bellow ICO.
This is smart contracts made easy for the average Joe.
High potential to bring mainstream adoption.
Going off the graph it looks like people knew it was going to list on binance
Its already better than blockcat but its a longterm hold
It's at the bottom now.. Only way is up!
Hope so
you dont see a pump incoming the near future?
