>mfw you can basically take courses for free at any university in the United States even after you graduate just by sitting in on lectures, buying the textbook, and minding your own business>college students still insist on taking "something fun"As someone who graduated a few years ago, just fucking major in whatever you think will make you the most money in this world OR if you have a very specific job that you are absolutely certain you want to do, major in whatever you need to get it.Do NOT major in whatever the fuck you think is interesting and want to know everything in depth about.Common sense but so many people do this.
This post is for burgers only, don't have to pay shit for education in the better world.
