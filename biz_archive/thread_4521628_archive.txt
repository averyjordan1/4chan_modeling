Would it be weird to bring my new Macbook Pro and iPhone X to dinner to flex on my cousins?
Thank mr skeltal
is it the 5k macbook?
It would be indeed very weird, as only ghetto niggers and 14 years olds flex with iphones.Just bring your phone, what's the point of buying it if you don't use it.
Forget the laptop, that's full autismo.
This lmao
Kill yourself at the dinner table over the turkey op
>mfw still using my macbook pro from 2009 with a cracked screen
Ha!What a cock.The new Mac's are junk and if you've not moved over to android this year you're fucking stupid.Used to love Apple now it's run by fucking idiots that want to hang with z rate celebs instead of letting the engineers do their job.
I'll be gutted when my 2016 Mac dies.
As for the phones, they're like kids toys compared to what you can do on droid.
Left in May and was gutted I hadn't earlier
You should invest in some confidence instead of expensive gadgets.
Confident people don't need to show off, they know they've made it without impressing their fucking cousin
Watch out folks, this nigga got 5k!
This is some fine champagne
Why the fuck would you bring a laptop to dinner?
>bringing the laptop to a dinnerThis is the /g/ kind of autism.Also >bringing iPhone X to flex the cousinsThis is the Vitalik kind of perversionWould you fuck your 10 years old cousin little tight pussy, OP, am I right?
