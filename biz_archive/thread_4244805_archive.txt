k LINK, 50k REQ, 1500 SALT>tfw when i definitely will end up wagecucking when i graduate next yearwill i even fucking make it.
if i ever wagecuck ill put all my salary in crypto but damn im starting to feel hopeless right now.
I'm planning on selling SALT as soon at it moons when the platform is released and holding LINK and REQ till late 2018 to 2019. but the uncertainty around the SALT limit and retail price is giving me shivers of not making it.
i am not going to make it am i?
link will be gone by next year by SEC.
REQ will just be downhill from here, and SALT is just a chinese scam coin.
not sure if srs>LINK is a utility token and the SEC has been clear that utility tokens are not securities>REQ is only a month old wtf and is below ICO price how lower can it fucking get>SALT has the most caucasian team ive ever seen
