Hell yeah, these idiots selling are going to remind us of all the guys on here telling war stories about how they "had 2000 bitcoins and sold them for $5 each" and "I had a bunch of Ethereum in 2015 but I sold after I listened to people on 4chan".
This is going to be awesome
I'm just pissed coinbase wont let me max out my credit cards

People are hoarding too muchLiterally everyone on /biz/ has 30k+ I've seen some anon mention having 500k+ from presaleIf its such a sure thing then it would already be mooningYet its constantly sinking

It's called a low volume pullback
anyone definitely NOT comfy holding this?
Hey
I do not think anyone that is Linkless could be comfy as they know in the back of their lizard brain section that it is going to go up to the moon.
They know it but chose to ignore it because it seems to good to be true (like BTC, ETH, and all other moon missions in the past)
Just bought back in the other day with my ETH pedo scandal gains.
Maybe you just aren't cut out for this.
No.
Why would I be comfy holding this bleeding piece of shit?All that effort picking alts for this?
LMAO, it's like every other alt: you either sell the top or you baghold.
It's so simple, just buy Bitcoin.
