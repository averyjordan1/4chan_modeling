I know the markets are insane, and while a lot of you are raking in thousands and millions, the other half is paying for it.
This is basically a battle of the whales, and a lot of our fates are unfortunately hanging in the balance.I just want to say I hope most of you guys make it, wherever you are from and whatever your investment is.
Be strong, there are tough times ahead.
