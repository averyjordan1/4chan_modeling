>he hasn't bought some HSTBig exchange listing within 24 hours, probably Binance.
Solid project, only on EtherDelta currently, so when this hits an actual exchange, it's gonna moon.Get in fags
voting on blockchain?hell no nibbaliteral poocoin
Didn't the devs already announce that its not Binance?

Stop spreading fake news pajeet, the project is solid, but it won't be listed on binance anytime soon cos it cost shit ton of money.
But 3 new exchange till the end of this month is still a good deal.
where does the info about new exchange within 24 hours come from?
Devs on telegram, you can check out
Jaipur.
*check it out*
Price predictions after it hits a few more exchanges?
why did ARN drop lower after listing on binance?
Bitcoin
Cryptopia is def going to be one of the exchanges.team is aussies, topia is new zealand.team member posted a photo with a sign that said new zealandbut yeah, if u haven't got at least a small bag of HST ur kinda a dumbass
BinanceThe devs literally said it won't be binance pajeet, you still can't read english after so many years out of Bombay?
The dev said it won't be Binance because they charge a lot of $ for a listing.Also he will announce an exchange in a few hours.
Most probably Cryptopia.
Most probably CryptopiaWell, at least that's something.
Big exchanges like Binance, Bittrex etc will come soon eventually.
It would be stupid for them to not list a project this solid.
Buys up to .001 should be pretty safe for the next 2 weeks
I'm hoping for it to reach at least 0.002 ETH once it hits some bigger exchanges.
Moon time
Why now?
that's some pajeetpay him no heeddo u think it will hit 2$ after the listings or maybe in december
my most comfy hold through the end of the year.
