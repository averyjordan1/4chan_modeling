USA fag here.I have my eye on an ICO.What would really happen if I bought some tokens?
nuthin
You would probably be able to afford a lambo
Door kicked in, dog killed, tied up, interrogated for hundreds of hours, tortured until you go unconscious, and then, and lastly you're thrown out a moving helicopter into the pacific ocean.
I have a cat not a dog will he be ok?
u would get those tokens
They send the tokens to you.
What question is that?
What were you expecting?
Its not a punishable offense to buy unregulated securities, it is one to sell them.
So nothing would happen to you.
If that sounds like a stupid hypocritical system that's because it is.
the IRS to wonder how you received tokens from an ICO sale that were coincidentally sent to you at the same time as every other person who bought in
it is one to sell them.Wait a sec, so if I bought ICO tokens and I sell them later I'm fucked?I THOUGHT THIS ONLY APPLIED TO THE COMPANY ISSUING THE TOKENS!!!!!!!
So I could buy but never sell?
You can sell low.
We believe in you.
yes they only dog
just look at historical ICO patterns:1. make sure you buy a TON of ICO shitcoin X because of FOMO2.
hodl your coins in anticipation for big payday in the long-term future3.
watch devs convert ICO to eth and cash out 4. code-base and project site literally shows tumbleweeds on their home page5.
payday never comesICO = you basically just crowdfunded "developers" with no accountability.
You would be fine.
The SEC wants to protect investors from scam IPOs.
The SEC views IPOs as a bad environment for investors.
You are an investor.
The SEC wants to protect you.
