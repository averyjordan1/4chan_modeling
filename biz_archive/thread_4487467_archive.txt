Brainlet here, some guy dropped this into a thread earlier: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IfF6WRunStGJ6fSVbUx8kvKf7CgOqJb0MWJ3pyHU5HE/editFirst time I hear of this, ICO is in a few days.
Did anyone understand what they are doing exactly?I get that they want to make this legit alternative to Tether, and tokenized assets, and some wallet to tie it together.
It all sounds too good to be true, did anyone check it out and understand everything?
