It's not morning you gook loving faggot.
It's at 18 cents.
It's the worst performing coin of the last month by a mile and has such an incompetent leadership team it's honestly going to fall even farther.
Worst investment I ever made.
some will win.
some will lose.
some were born to sing the blues.
(LINK holders are the ones who will win)

The moon mission to 40 cents just begun
FOMOYeah trying to jump on a flying rocket, this will work out just fine.
Buy some dodgecoins while you at it anons.
moon mission to less than 3x valueSeems like wishful thinking and in reality most of you would be happy to break even.
I have this strange feeling in my head telling me to sell all my alts and go all in on link.
It's like a voice screaming to do it.But that would mean I have to sell most of my alts at a small loss to do it.
But on the other hand I can't do anything because I just keep thinking about putting everything in link
rich stay rich, poor stay poor.
