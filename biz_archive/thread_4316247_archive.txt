Link bro.
Segey is solving the lambo problem.
I have pledged my life to chainlink.
Its hella cheap right now too.
Do yourself a favor and at least buy $50 worth of it right now.
You will be happy 2 years from now.
If shit goes south you are only out $50.
Be smart anon, make good choices.
We are all in this together, and all going to fucking make it.

For stability and gains, Stellar lumens.I don't even have more than 3% of my portfolio in lumens myself, but I know it's the most stable long term more-than-10x-profit choice.Ethereum is kind of "the future", but stellar is more conservative and careful with their updates and are babysat by IBM, as well as being in bed with banks.
They have to keep things fast, good and simple.
They are also not decentralized so they are politically stable.
ETHIt's going to be huge when it changes to POS.
req.
it's simple.
how much do you think link will be in june 2018?im holding 5k link, bought in at .16$
ETP and WTC
THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION AND YOU ARE STUPID.NOBODY FUCKING KNOWS WHAT TWO YEARS WILL DO TO A GODDAMN PIECE OF BARK, LET ALONE ANY CURRENCYFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
Worth getting in Link do you reckon?
I'm unsure, this board is full of evangelists and people calling it the biggest shitcoin that's ever existed.
