I just read a detailed article on metaverse.
is it worth investing?
I have some savings and thinking of investing into it.
Anyone can give me some advice?
yes im all in !
If you compare it to neo and qtum.
It is extremely undervalued.
ETP has strong fundamentals.
Ignore the shills and focus on its strength.
Eric Gu is a visionary leader and yes, it is worth investing into ETP.
Fuck to the yes.
This is literally the most undervalued coin and isnt too shilled on biz either.
being shilled now.
Still buy this.
Best Chink coin long term hodl.
This will be 50 US and overtake NEO's vaporware
