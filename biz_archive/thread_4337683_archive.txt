Cheers.
Feel free to add some lines and I'll add it to the pasta.
Also post cyberpunk pics for ambiance.

Love it.
I'm going to pretend this is the life of the digitally-destitute Arklet that I tip in the story.
> decentralized proof of authority world govmt> citizens get to vote for national rulers either by holding stakes or performing work in nationalised facilities> you've been elected the ruler of Burma 3d time in a row> you dont even need to do anything as you installed a supercomputer on every city 5 yrs ago> all of them still pull data from Chainlink to compute optimal decisions> 15% the nodes they use are in your possesion> basically, u spend national budget to pay yourself in LINK> by the end of term the demand for your nodes will grow by another 3% as the result of LINK stacking
I like this, and I'm lacking a good ChainLink entry.
I'll try to work some of this into the pasta next time.
The year is 2025 (real)>intellengence has been augmentented by a trivial ai, sparking a cyborg singularity>We are everywhere in the universe
Oh ye, cyberpunk picsIs this cyberpunk enough?
Resistance is futile.Good enough for me.
