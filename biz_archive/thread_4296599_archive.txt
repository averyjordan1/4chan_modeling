thoughts?
I like it, but it is like two months old.
Give it some time.
is waiting a good strategy in this case?
why?
Well it is a longer term hold.
Or you are mining it.
I am mining it.
I don't expect it to 5x or 10x for a few months.
Also, I like the community a lot, so it could be VERY successful in the long run, but most people buy BTC or flip alts short term.
I see.
I do mine it, ZEN and VTC don't look that good now anyway
I like Zen, but I don't think it has the same potential to 10x or more suddenly, so I switched.
