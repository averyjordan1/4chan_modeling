Say Trump repatriates Apple.
How will this affect the globalized economy?IMHO Ireland would collapse, Starcucks and others who game the system would follow Apple.I don't blame britfags for seceding with some states being allowed literally steal taxes.
Regardless of political association I think nobody will say 14.5 Bn couldn't be used to fix the roads in US.
This is waiting to be unwrapped.
