Did I fuck up not selling this?Who else is still holding?
sorry brah everyone left for AVT
You people will never leanr holy shitWHY ARENT YOU JUST SELLING IF YOU MADE PROFIT?WHY?I learned it after the first time when i had the opportunity to make 50% and i thought:>Sheeeeit lets hope for moreAnd than i lost the 50% gains and i sold only with 5%
yes...u will be fucked up if u not selling it...look at their wp, its shit, product release after 5 yrs.
lets assume its good, are you going to hold fucking 5 yrs.
u will get zillion buy back opportunities in these 5 yrs...if you dont sell now, u hate money and regret forever
I'm holding because I bought at the dip after the first spike.
It keeps going down and then bouncing back up so I'd waitEveryone yelling SELL SELL SELL Is fudding hard
still holding, was tempted to dump but every time it drops to 95 cents it gets bought up so support is growing :)
Don't hold.
Cut your losses.
This coin is literally just buzzwords.
It's a pump and dump with no foreseeable re-pump.
Long term I have big doubts but there's no point selling at a dip when it's riding a sine wave
Yeah sell the dip and buy the top, that's how you make money.
I just fucking panic sold because volume had been dead for a while and was fearing a massive drop back to the 30s... FUUUU
wtf...easy 5 dollars hold unless your a noob
but why?
isn't it too ambitious
i still have 500 of the 3000 i started with at .29
Telling you, just wait it out and at least sell when it's back up if not longer.
