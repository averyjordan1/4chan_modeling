What do you do once you cash out with with 100k from cryptocurrency profits?I live in Canada is the government gonna want half of that?
I am a religious organization.
Give it all to me as a "donation" and I will give it back to you, tax-free.
Is that what I need to do?
Make up a relgiion?sounds in line with my interests
if BTC ATMs become popular enough you could use cash as much as possible tax free.
Groceries, gas, strippers, drugs, etc
Holy fuck I would love to pay strippers in btc
No.
Give it to someone else that is already a religious organization.
Making one is quite the process and will cost you over $100k anyways.

Genius AnonDo you actually do that or is this tax evasion?

Just wait.
The BTC windfall will buy you groceries for life, so every last dollar of wagecuckery can go towards paying mortgage and other tax-free endeavours.Fuck the government.

There's bound to be a route to launder it.

Good question
Sure you can do this, but then whenever you want to use the gold to buy something you have to cash it in, and (at least in my country) if you need to do that in any kind of hurry you're going to take a loss on it that is basically as bad as tax.If you just want to get out of crypto into a more stable investment this wouldn't be a bad option.
I have gold and crypto personally.
More gold than crypto, partially because because I'm risk averse, partially because I dithered too damn long for the cryptotrain.

The gain is all you need to tax.

I fed cash into a machine and scanned the code.
I presume it works the other way too.
