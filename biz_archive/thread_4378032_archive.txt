What did it mean by this?
triple top, time to short, r-right guys?
All in 100x margin short bitmex
it means 7300 is not happening but if your sell order was set to that you almost made it
Ta is uselessTA didn't predict that fucking $700 climb out of nowhereTA works when logic applys
TA is useless>Quite clearly tops out 3 times at the exact same spot on the chart before bottoming out on the exact same trend line on the bottomPlease just shut up
Quite clearly tops out 3 times at the exact same spot>exact same spotLol no, check the graphic again
difference of 0.000001%wtf I hate charts now
massive sell wall at 7275 nothing more..

standard flagpoleit's going to breakout.
10k incoming
in my amateur opinion, looks like support is rising against a consistent sell wall.
wouldnt be surprised if a whale comes in a decides to bust through the wall some time soon.
could be another ascending triangle, with a flat top within the margin of errora lot of people got faked yesterday thinking they were looking at a rising wedge, but it turned out to behave more like an ascending triangle
I agree, TA in crypto doesn't work, it follows it's own rules.
fuckk off with your 5min chart
