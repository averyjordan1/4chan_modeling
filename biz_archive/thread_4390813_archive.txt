Every day that I don't just get a wallet and invest into bitcoin is just more money I have to put into buying more bitcoin because it's as fucking clear as day this mother fucker is going to hit 10k at least before it comes down again in a few months/years.Fucck it boys, I'm going in.
This is going to be some quick cash, I hope I don't jinx it for all of you
>not even a 2xDude
Thanks OP, maybe you'll finally be the jinx that brings down BTC forever and end this tormented crypto dream.
We can finally go back to trading shares on robinhood again.
You mean seg2x or 2x the price or something
Why do you need bitcoin at all?
What's the point
dump about $300 dollars on btc while it's 7.2k>it shoots up to 10k>I make X percentage after selling it to a chump like you in the middle of a FOMO freakout>I spend it on hookers and cocaine>you make a JUST thread on bizWhy not?
I never bought bitcoin.
Because there is no point.
So your point is you buy something off somebody who thinks you're a fool for buying and then hope you find a greater fool later on.
Sounds legit.
Good luck holding
I never bought bitcoin.That's why you'll always be poor.
And I can always cash it in.
They have ATM's for bitcoins and shit now.
x price
Youre doing it wrong.Buy from the panicking suckers who are selling at a loss.
Then resell to them at a profit.
Buy back when they are at a loss.
Sell when youre at a profit.Zero sum game dude.
So get on the winning side.
I x10 with altcoin pumps the last few months.
Store value in fiat.
Sleeping tight
How do you get into the market then if not buying btc?
Sucking dick for eth?
Because 10k is a good time to sell bozo.
Waiting for 11k-12k is really pushing it.
Anything around 15k is pure asinine.
Cash out at 10k, wait for it to dip back to 7k-8k and buy, make a profit when it goes back up to 16k.Rinse, repeat.
Yea fiat eth on fucking kraken then rotate across alt exchanges and then back to fucking kraken
Zero sum gameThis.
