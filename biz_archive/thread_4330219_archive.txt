proof
I have a good friend who has been in crypto longer than me that told me about coins before they got big like ETH, ANS/NEO, and WTC.
After that it has been a game of gauging the market sentiment for each of my coins to know when to sell to BTC.
Luckily for me it's been a good year for BTC.
I got in BTC at the $750-800 range.
Since I've done so well, I treat this more as a learning experience now and have taken up day trading.
Day trading is wild, I can't explain it.
so basically you got lucky after investing daddy's money?
wow quite the success story
I'll be back when I get my 100k and I'll post proof then.
Haha yeah daddy's money and luck, that's it.
I make sure to read up on all the tech, but yeah a lot of this is dumb luck.
