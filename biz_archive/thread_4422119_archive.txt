1) Started with 2500$ -> invested in a few coins (LTC / ETH / BTC mostly)2) Gained 1500$.
3) Started researching futur coins on Biz / reddit since September -> Invest in REQ during the pre-sale and buy Link on Binance.4) Lost 1700$ and didn't make benefits on the big coins.5) Realize that Biz is good to detect futur coins (the one that will month in months / years)6) Realize that the market don't follow new techs, improvements.7) Finally will hold these coins and swing trade to accumulate more and will buy some ETH with extra money to keep my first strategy.I am doing it right ?
