It's dejure vs defacto decentralization.
You'll naturally have more powerful and better educated people whose opinions will matter more- that's inherent in any system.
What you don't want is that to be ingrained in the system so individuals can't work around these influential people if they become corrupt or not as useful.So, for instance, when Core prohibits someone from merely proposing a blocksize increase, they're acting as defacto gatekeepers.
That's centralization of decision-making, something Bitcoin was designed to avoid.
