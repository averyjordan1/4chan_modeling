What coin do you use to save your gains?
Bitcoin crash and moons you can't really tell when to buy alts or not with bitcoinsTether is into some shady shit i dont trust bitfinexEtherum seems the only choice the price is reasonable kept between 300 and 350, started a week ago trading only etherum pairs and went from 8eth to 11eth
LTC
Will start using DAI when it's launched.
Essentially a non-jewed decentralized USDT
Fiat
USD
Most steady coin I have seen right now is Ripple
Bitcoin, Monero, or Tether are my recommended stable storage coins.
