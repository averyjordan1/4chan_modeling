If I assume that BCH crashes in the near future.
I don't want to argue here, let's just assert it does.
What is the best possible move?
Would I sell all alts and move 100% BTC or would I scoop up cheap alts right now?Would the money from BCH flow back into the alts or into BTC?
In any case would alts drop if BTC surges again?
"This is my take on it.
Whales who have a stake in seeing BCH succeed are pumping everything they've got into the coin to foil the difficulty adjustment that comes tomorrow.
At this rate, if they can get BCH to around $2000 by tomorrow night, then it will remain profitable after adjustment and we won't see miners flee back to BTC afterward.
This will be the death blow for BTC as miners all consolidate under the BCH banner for good.$2000 is the tipping point.
If BCH can hit it in the next 24 hours, then it's going to keep rising forever.
If it doesn't, all those gains are going to siphon back into BTC and BCH will deflate back to 10% value of BTC"Sharing this info.
It may never crash.
You would short BCH at the top.
OP asks what to do if BCH theoretically crashed>Shill him on why it won't crashGreat job guy
What exchanges support shorting?
What about stop-loss?
So hypothetically the money would flow back into BTC and leave the alts mostly untouched?Then investing in low alts wouldn't be the worst idea and even less risky, right?
Bumping for an answer pls
welp, it's 2.4k now.
