The mad man actually did it
Would’ve been more impressive if it’s BTC value was anywhere near where it used to be...
And it's already back @ 997.. what a pussycoin it won't stay above 1k for more than 1 minute
He thinks in terms of fiat in something everyone is going crazy over for a 'flippening'If it can't even break 0.25 again say hello to another slow and painful dip back
theres has been a 90 bch wall all day long
Why is it pumping so hard?
Been in the real world for a couple of weeks...
Reminder Bitcoin Gold futures mooned harder percentage wise.
It’s a better version of bitcoin.
What made you think it wouldn't hit 1k?
BTC is having the correction after its rocket up to $7.8k and people are hedging on BTC 'dying' (like always) which makes them bullish on BCH
it's what I figured out... thnaks
