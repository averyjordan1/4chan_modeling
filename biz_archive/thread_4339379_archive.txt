Sorry for your loss anon.
Unfortunately you're part of core's plan.
Dropping a tactical sell nuke and creating a lot of bagholders that will resist possible incoming pumps was intentional.
You should definitely drop those bags, there may be yet another attempt at a later point.
These bch people aren't very fond of giving up
