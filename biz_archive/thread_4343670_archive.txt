Why the hell would anyone invest in crypto?
It's volatile, no one outside of speculators actually use it, and it's fucking intangible.
It would make way more sense to just invest into stocks we know are going to go up steadily and wait a couple of years to retire off of them.
These get rich quick schemes are bullshit.
Invest in something stable that can't fail, like Bank of America, JP Morgan, Tesla etc.
gamblingalso, don't invest crazy amounts
dude, bank stocks have fallen to pennies (e.g.
$34 to less than a dollar) in times of crisis.le stocks are safe is just a meme, the only thing a brainlet can bank on are index funds and even those can go down by 50% over the period of years
>stocks we know are going to go up steadily
implying the dollar isnâ€™t totally assfucked
something stable that can't fail>TeslaOh I am laffin
Let me explain it to you: If you have 10 Million $ and you get a return of 5% each year - its awesome and you can life a nice and comfy life.But if you are a fucking poorfag it doesnt matter if you have 1$, 1000$ or even 100k - it will get you nowhere.
You will stay poor and there is no way that you can life from your investment.
Rich stay rich - poor stay poor except they take a risk.
this is one of the best things I've ever read on /biz/
