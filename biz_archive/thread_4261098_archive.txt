I started in may and am down 10%.
missed every pnd, bought bleeding coins that didn't pump, panic sold a few times etc.
there were so many opportunities for me to turn my $500 into $50k but I didn't.how sad.
Such is the fate for Alice fags
safe is safe
hindsight is 20/20.
The only good advice is that you park your money in a solid top 10 coin and leave it.
Set a blockfolio warning when it goes past your sell target (2x in your case).
If you daytrade around youll fuck yourself with that little capital.
Is it still 0.0001LTC for pits, you whore?
>held BTC>didn't try to play the market, just held>up 100kJUST
I'm all in LTC but thinking of pulling out into fiat now.
Too much green on coinmarketcap.
This is how I was before I decided to go all in on one thing, and accumulate it whenever I could.
4261117Alice has best themes in general, and we'll all fund Reimu's faith box when we make it.
put in 3k just before and during the china shit.Right now I'm at 2.5k.
Been as low as 1.7k twice but that's just how it goes sometimes, and only been above my starting $ once, when LINK was ATH.Still have a lot to learn and more mistakes to make, hopefully I don't lose it all before then.
I hear you buddyThe solution is to put more paychecks into cryptoI had accumulated about 500% of crypto by july, by the end of august i made it 430$-440$ with mining payouts (XD) then i just put actuall money in to get it to 2,450$ three weeks ago, put it all on altcoins, made my 0.41 BTC portfolio into 0.34 BTC with the altcoin massacre (feels bad man) but now with the B2X miracle i'm up to 2,830$even dumb traders like us can make it if we can just get some of this shitcoin we call FIAT in real life ;)
Whoops I meant 500$ of crypto not 500%
I were whitelisted on confido but bought more req instead :(
