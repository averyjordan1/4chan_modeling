Binance, Bittrex or some other gay shit?
No margin-hippie bullshit-only coin flipping.
I prefer the interface and ethereum pairs in binance.But bittrex has less market manipulation, stop losses and is safer to store your money on.
one with the bigger volume and smaller spreadso it depends on coinbut bitfinex has best interface and settings
