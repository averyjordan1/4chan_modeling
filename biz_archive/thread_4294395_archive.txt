wow
doesnt mean shit, can break up or down.
nobody knows anything lol.
wait for it too make its move, set your stops
Yeah it's gonna break at some point.
I'm feeling BCH has one more up in it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks down if BTC starts a slow recovery
Just broke bullish.
Going all in.
I am also all in and it is fucking 5 am over here!And I can't go to sleep lol!
Low balance points, minimum resistance, it's gonna break down.
Yeah and looking at each high it gets lower and lower and the volume is finally slowing down, think its going to be a slow decend down now
