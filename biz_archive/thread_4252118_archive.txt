Where my LTC bro's at
ltc was a safe haven during the segwit pumpsfork is off.
no reason to be in ltc
yeah there is cuz its going to 3 digits by eoy
who cares about 10%
litecoin is a segshit coin too
litecoin simply has no place in the modern crypto economy.
propped up by chinese miners it doesn't have anything to offer you can't get better elsewhere.the only people who care about useless coins like this are speculators.
stuck to exchanges until interest dies and volume disappears.
LTC is unironically a better deal than BTC.
Comfy asf.
