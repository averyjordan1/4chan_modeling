Did confido say they were implementing LINK for a meme?
holy shit hahaha

It's their tactic to lure the deluded linkies into buying confido.They know that it's so goddamn easy to trick the deluded linkies 'cause they will buy and eat whatever shit related to chainlink.
It's so true it's hilariousWhoever made confido was obviously a /biz/tard
it's not funny you guys
what exchange is confido on?i want to invest in it.
it looks very promising.
"joost">shilling link>name coin after a fucking dick pillHe was without a doubt.
When I first saw this coin my inmediate thought was "this is a scam, look at that name"I mean, Confido?
that Pajeet lawyer shit was a meme too.....its so obvious in hindsight
does anyone else think Ripio is confido 2.0?literally RIP in the name similar to confido with CON in the name.
