The Chinese saved bitcoin by resisting crazy blocksize increases for so long (I mean fucking 20mb what the fugg brah).
As much as Jihan has been playing a villain and BCH seems inferior we should respect the Chinese players who didn't cave to the big money trying to pressure them back then.
I shudder to imagine what BTC would look like if it had gone to 20MB blocks.
Yeah faster transaction times and lower fees, utterly terrifying.
Both of those exchanges are now against core.
Moving their mines to bcash.
They couldn't resist the increased mining profit that jihan has set up.
I sure do love mining that only the mining conglomerates can support.
Truly the people's money
This is why we should move to Vert...
and transition to a pool owner oligarchy instead?
sounds great.pow a shit.
- China #1??
Gavin Andersen is a CIA maggot and unlike jihan with bcash, never controlled bitcoin.
Chinks didn't resist shit.
pow a shit.This guy's got the right idea
It would have been the same as BCash: a pump and dump, since all whales except Ver are anti big blocks.http://shitco.in/2015/08/19/the-bitcoin-xt-trojan/The USG has been trying to hardfork Bitcoin for years now, and failing misserably.
