/biz/, I know you've been wojacking through this entire runup of btc.
I have been too.
But I encourage you to seek refuge in a POS coin that's kept a stable price throughout the whole runup.
With bullish news coming for btc non-stop there's seemingly no end in sight.
But don't be a beta and cash out into btc to wait it out until the next correction.
There's still profits to be made.>How's this going to be profitable?5000% ROI until Dec. 4.
That's 13% return per day.
That's doubling your stack each week.
That means as long as the price does better than -13% per day, you're beating btc.
Think NEO will have better performance over the next 2 weeks?

What better bag to hold than one that doesn't go down in price and accumulates 13% more of itself every day.
