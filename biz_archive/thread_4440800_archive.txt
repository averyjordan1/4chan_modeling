If your portfolio does not -exclusively- consist of USD, BTC, ETH, and possibly LTC you will NOT make it long term.
Having any other asset shows you are clawing at the walls of your life's prison, unable to escape wagecuckery by being more clever than the next average miserable bozo.You will -never- deploy a meaningful amount of capital into lottery shitcoins.
Even if your LINK/VERGE/STELLAR/(SHITCOIN) moons 2000%, your 100$ investment will not be life changing.You will ONLY have the conviction of spending 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000+ dollars into actual meaningful, provably appreciable assets (like BTC).
Doing so earlier rather than later will net you more profit in the long run, and WILL get you out of wagecuckery eventually.
Spending your time/money on shitcoins only detracts from this ideal.DO NOT look at the blue chip coins and think "they are too high, they will drop in price, I can time a massive buy when the blood bath crash inevitably comes", because timing the market is a fool's errand.
Dollar cost average your way in over time.
Simply buy more.
On a long enough time horizon anything around and less than 10k$/BTC will yield 1000% returns.
Memes aside, just hold.
