While BTC/BCH dampen "King" bitcoin's "Nokia" reputation just get comfy with Ethereum's "iPhone" opportunity while it's early and the ratio is in your favor.
Something to consider.
Not financial advice.
Probably should have sold nokia when this cover came out.Good call on oil though.
The problem with analogies is they're a lot like fucking a supermodel with HPV.
It feels great and you can imagine it vividly but that doesn't mean it's got any connection to reality or is a good idea.
When iPhone came out, fucking everyone had a cellular phone.In mobile timeline Cryptos are in year 1991.
pretty much although a year in crypto at this point is equivalent to a good few years in dotcom bubble or phone development, I expect within the next 3-5 years the actual "iphones" or "facebooks, googles and amazons" of the crypto world will be starting to develop
You're right we are in a crypto bubble right now.
