Anons of biz, do any of you know how to hide money tax free internationally?
Before half of you freak out, I plan to live abroad when I have enough funds, most likely in Asia or the Middle East.
The US is one of only TWO (fucking ERITREA) countries in the world that tax its citizens no matter where they live in the world, even if all of their money is totally made outside of America and has nothing to do with the states.
Anyway, there is legislation called FATCA that is some of the most draconian, bully legislation to ever pass.
It involves forcing foreign banks to give up the all of the account details of American citizens with accounts in their bank.
They basically blackmailed the majority of foreign banks in most countries to comply with this (or the us gvt will literally just steal 30% of transactions that go to that bank from the US), although some countries and individual banks have refused to comply.Anyway, do any of you know any non FATCA compliant banks or places to store fiat internationally that the IRS still doesn’t have access to in 2017?
I’m aware I can keep most of my funds in crypto which is effectively hidden/tax free, but since crypto is still far from mainstream I will need a bank account with a decent amount of fiat for rent, food, spending money etc.
Do any of you do this or do something similar?
Let’s turn this into a discussion thread.
