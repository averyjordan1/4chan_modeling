Been shilling POWR all day every day, hardly anyone listens, shilled it when it was under 1500 sats, all I get is "nah shitcoin as usual" just goes to show you guys don't know hwo to indentify a good coin with good usecases.
Well deserved to the people who bought in and made nice gains.
I've said in threads power ledger was very likely to hit 5k this time since its high 4k 3 times already, people said they'll sell since it's coming down with no basis.
Look what happened now, bad decision on your part.
Will you continue to hold, or will you sell?
Been on-board for 2 weeks now.
Some nice gains just wish I accumulated more before the rise.
Taking profits, I will never fully sell POWR as its not smart to fully exit this position, I can sell some now and buy back cheaper when it comes down if ever, if it doesn't I still hold POWR
srry guys, it's time for bad luck dumpi decided to buy itfirst at 56know at 50k
Why did you buy after those fucking candles, you're an idiot
