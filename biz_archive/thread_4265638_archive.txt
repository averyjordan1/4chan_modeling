Chart is well outside historical trends.
Previous times gold soared tremendously.
This time around Bitcoin exists.
Get ready for ignition.
A flight to commodities usually happens when bubbles burst in real estate and debt based derivitaves, which takes the whole economy with it.
I personally don't think Bitcoin will survive it, would rather be in cash when it happens.
Good luck with that.
