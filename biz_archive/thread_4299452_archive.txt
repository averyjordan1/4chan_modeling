I'm so sick and fucking tired of Rory and getting raped by BTC forks.
I'm going to hard fork the ChainLink smart contract at exactly November 31, 2017 14:15:00 UTC.
Fuck rory and his vague as shit replies.
All wallets that hold LINK during this time will receive the same amount of BLINK.
I'm also going to try to contact COSS exchange if they would partner with us so we can compete with SWIFT backing LINK.
>LINK forkfor fucks sake /biz/is this coin doesn't succeed this is going to make this board empty from the mass suicide
That would be kinda cool, if you did this Iâ€™d hold it for lols
Oh bro im going to do it, and its not entirely impossible that we will reach Bittrex first given how fucking lazy rory is.
kewl i want some BLINK
i say do it
Would I recieve BLINK if I hold my LINK in MEW?
Not like anything would happen considering the dumb money shitshow right now
Yes, any wallet that can hold ERC20 tokens.
You need to be holding LINK to receive BLINK.
You dont need to do anything, my contract will send you the BLINK automatically if you hold LINK during approximately the time i specified.
The exact time may vary based on the block number but it is approximately during November 31, 2017 14:15:00 UTC.
i'm looking forward to more fucking red candles
Fuck the Corelinkers.
We will not allow the future of ChainLink to be controlled by 2 people (Sergey and Rory).

What if my link is in COSS?
Will I have to move my Link to MEW or another wallet?
It's... definitely not his job to seek exchange listings.
I thought OP was satire, and I liked it.
You are committed.
You need to hold it in your own wallet my fellow Blinkie.
