Hey guys,I'm a EU residen (France).I plan to build a product (digital) with a friend of mine.We're planning to bootstrap it in 3months.
If we execute it good enough we're pretty sure we're going to generate $60k/month for at least 6 month.Where should we go to build this product, and get a fiscal residency so we end up paying as little tax as possible and still be 100% legal.Keep in mind we dont mind moving and living in that said country.Also, will I get taxed twice once I move the capital back to France (should I?
)./Biz/ tell me the optimal strategy, I know you have it.
lets take an exemple:I move to Bulgaria in 2018I develop my business there.I create a company there, and start generating revenue, lets say $100k/monthI pay 10% taxes on this revenue, Let's say the company has 500k after taxes;I give the money to me, I pay dividends (5% in Bulgaria).I make $475k.I move back to France a year after, do I have to pay taxes again on this?
Interesting, i would also like to know this
Fuck the EU
wheres my cut?
