How does institutional money buy BTC....?What gatekeepers or exchanges do they have to go through to actually get it....?
I thought BTC was supposed to be a million by 2020.
Why does it say 2027?
I don't want to wait that long.
There are specific escrows for dealing with the buying and selling of Crypto in the millions.
If you don't know who they are, you probably can't afford their services.

Where do the escrows get the coins from....?Directly from miners...?Unregulated exchanges.....?
I heard 2020 also but if BTC ever does get to a million, 10 years really isint that long but it will feel like an eternity of posting wojaks
