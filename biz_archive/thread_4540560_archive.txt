>All my normie friends talk about bitcoin and crypto>No one invests, and if they do it's only 500 euros into BTC Is the normie wave a meme?

A few weeks ago during the cashening my girlfriend was telling me about how some guy in her class was raving about making $12 on BCH.I think the normie wave really is a meme.
