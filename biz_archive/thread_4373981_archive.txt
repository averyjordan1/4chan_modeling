Anyone know this token?I did some research :ICO did not raised so much since they run end of october (BTC fork season)from 21 millions token supply, more than half burned.
Total supply now 10.2 millions token.
I can confirm this since I did math manually count total token holders page by page on ethplorer.io.
check contract address :0x1183f92a5624d68e85ffb9170f16bf0443b4c242circulating supply just 6 millions token.
current price $0.2 thats make its marketcap just $1.2 millions Coinmarketcap didn't display their circulating supply and got wrong token supply info.
(they didn't count burned token).
Maybe this the reason this token flying under radar since no one knows its 1 millions m.cap unless they do math.- Project will launch end of this year- Qvolta security apps just launch.- Qvolta android and ios apps coming Q1 next year.if their dev can deliver im sure this one easily 10-15x before end of this year.
tested their alpha, seems nice.

Any thoughts on this?
