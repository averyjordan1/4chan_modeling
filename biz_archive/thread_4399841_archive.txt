That's it.
I caved in.
I bought LINK today.
Why?
Because 4chan has always been ahead of the trend for miles, in politics, in memes, and certainly in crypto.
I did it because I trust 4chan.
enjoy your bags, you'll have them for quite a while
Should of bought BCH.
BCH is a cashgrab, core will always prevailchan memed the new president, they can certainly meme the new ethereum
Thanks for feeding me, boyos
YepIt's obvious that someone (or a bunch of people) knows something that we ignoreMy guess is that a bunch of neets from here mined btc the same day it was released and now they keep browsing here and try to throw us a few bones here and there
4399884LINK is literally the Trump of crypto, it will prevail because of the power of the shilling of 4chan that will reach all corners of the internet
chan were being manipulated by Russians on social media, like everyone else in the US.
But it workedThat's all that matters anonIt's unironically a shit coin that will moon through the power of shilling and memes
