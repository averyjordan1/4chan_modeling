If the reasoning behind this whole ""flippening"" is to get an actual usable currency why use a shady Bitcoin fork instead of litecoin I don't get crypto
The other coins are Asic resistant so the miners don't support them.
because it is all about politics and milking the sheep that are idiotic enough to follow due to their greed when they sense some money to be made.
but in reality they always lose in a long term prospective by following "the latest trends".
thisAlso to some extent but the rational person will bet on the winner (BCH), gain money, then get out into something else before the stigma of miner politics makes BCH implode.
sounds like a rational person wouldnt even get involved but thats TOO rational
no, only greedy people get involved in this, since there is no possible indicator aside from astronomical shilling in which way this will go.
Especially if you buy BCC for 1400$ when it was just 1/7 of that a few weeks ago.
That is a good way to get completely assfucked and just gambling.My bet is on BTC, but I don't own any of those at the moment.
because retards will fall for it because it has Bitcoin in the name.
there is literally no reason to use bch over ltc
ignore the legacy btc tards and their chink counterparts and use the coins with blatantly superior tech
ITS NOT A FUCKING SHADY BITCOIN FORK YOU MOTHERFUCKING DUMBASS
