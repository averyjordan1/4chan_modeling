why doesn't /biz/ care more about options?just as risky as crypto, if not more.where are the options degenerates?pic related
49% gain.
Zzzzzzzz
not my picbut regardless.
1000%+ gains definitely possible, and then you dont have to deal with the hassle of going crypto -> fiat to spend your money
I love them, I use crypto to hopefully get enough money to be able to daytrade optionsonce you get leverage enough to do naked anythings thats when you can make some amazing spreads and really capitalize on volatility
selling naked puts or calls going into earnings is a man's way of doing things.go to bed and wake up in debt hundreds of thousands of dollars
short everything
