Dont be a fuck up like me.
I inherited 50k and spent it all on food, my car, insurance, phones, laptops and shit like that.
I only put like 500 in crypto and made like 20k but im still wanting to off myself practically just thinking about if i had actually invested more.
Just dont feel the need to go all in on one thing.
Buy like 2 miners with 6k and spend the other 4k to trade during this "bubble period" or whatever u wanna call it.
If u daytrade the next 6 months and mine for the next 4 years you will have at least 250k.Dont be a fucking idiot like me, you have been warned.
If you want to hedge your bets then get a job and buy a little silver each weak as well.
You will be set for liyfe/
What got you 20k from 500

Might want to seriously consider some stocks, OP.
Of course I'm in crypto, but I've got money tied up in stocks as well, and they're much more secure.
Just need to look at stocks that have continually gone up year after year.
Bitcoin and nothing elsemaybe put 10% in ethereum or Litecoin just to make yourself feel smart
