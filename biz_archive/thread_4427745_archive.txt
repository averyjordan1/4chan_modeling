BIZ is crying all over LINK and REQ so hard for several days already completely ignoring that whole altcoin market is tanking.I JUST PURCHASED 10 THOUSAND LINK at 2000 Satoshi and 5000 REQ at 600 SAT.LET'S SEE NOW how it works out.. Let's seeAlways do opposite to what BIZ advices
Thank you those which dumped.Let's see if I can become a bagholder from these levels.
Even if BTC goes to 10000 USD.Maximum loss would be ~25 % on LINK and REQ which is 1600 SAT for LINK and 480 SAT for REQ.LET'S see.
What are you talking about?
All I see is LINK shills.

Not sure why people cry about Link, I've been flipping ETH / LINK non stop all week since the price bounced between pretty predictable points.
no one cares
