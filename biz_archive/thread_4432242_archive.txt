% of coins in top 50 wallets% in one walletDefend this, i dare you
These wallets are all coins held by devs for incentivizing nodes and their personal holdings.
A few of the other top wallets are binance wallets.
The other whales are accumulating because smart money.
You act like this is a bad thing.
I would be worried of they were dumping.
It isn't a problem.
At all.
It's good if you want to buy in and expect a huge pump someday.It's however grossly unfair and just another example of how crypto is rigged and the elites hold a greater percentage of wealth than the Jew bankers do with the dollar.
>Its a bad thing that Bill Gates has lots of dollarslmao

get your commie crap out of here.
nobody ever said crypto was gonna redistribute wealth to the masses.
So one person hold 35% of link?
wtf why are you buying link then when a huge amount is held by them?
and the rest of the top 50 wallets holds 47% fucking percent are you crazy?
Go buy bitbean
35% in one wallet
There's a toilet next to the podium.
You you can't see the advantages to combining crapping and speaking, I can't help you.
this.
Crypto is the future but the kikes are still gonna fuck us real good.
before the normie masses get into crypto the big players will already have their stacks.
The powerful will stay in power.
The only difference is that there will be some neets who saw all this coming with massive fortunes.
You fuckin neets led me to salvationLiving rent free in my mind...
Imagine being so god damn fucking clueless about Chainlink that you don't even know what the 35% wallet is about.Fucking lmao.
