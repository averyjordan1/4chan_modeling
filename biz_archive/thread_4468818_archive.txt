After going balls deep in CL at ath i am looking for yet another good investment to burn my money with.
I was thinking about throwing some pennies at https://raiden.network/ .
Anyone wants to share FUD/Shills?
My second choice would be Factom, hovering around same price for quite some time now
It's all good, two weeks I'm telling to /biz/ to invest in this, reminder that this is mooning with 0 communication and marketing from brainbot, close to no shilling and it's only on Binance right now.I let you imagine how it will be the 28th and when other exchanges will add it, it's the next EOS/OMG.
this will probably be one of the next 1B tokens, probably by mid 2018 or so.

its already at 6x of ico, u end bag holding for next 6 months.
be careful
you're not wrong to be wary, but this is one of few projects that has a direct use case
raiden network doesn't even need a coin and they sayt on their site the coin has no real value or use within the network.retard.
yes it does but the token's position in the ecosystem is still kinda "ummm...,myabe youll need to pay in tokens to do some premium stuff.....but the network will remain free for normal users".... until they define the token's uscase, im not touching it

Got in at ico and sold out at the first peak, but missed the chance to buy back in.
Gut tells me it will dip and then ath again, but being this new it may just correct downward in the short term.
Going to to make a conservative bet at next dip.
repeating the same nonsense over and over again.
