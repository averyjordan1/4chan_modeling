I went all in on this at $.30 and warned you guys that it'd be the next NEO this morning.
it's now at $.70, with no brakes.Your move, biz.
Lost money with this piece of shitSaging everything related to it now
I'm scared to take 2.5x profits on this one.. still room for growth.
I don't want to be that guy that missed out on x10...
I literately would rather go back to 500 euro.
i bought the top yesterday held thru the night and sold when link started mooning.
Shortly after NULS 2xs.
I can't not get fucked.
I hate my life.
Not too late to buy back in.
I'm expecting $50m cap short term.
