Tell me about good podcasts to educate myself while commuting.
All sorts of things: Economics, investing, "life hacks", you name it.
freakonomics any good?
How I Built This is pretty good.
It's an NPR podcast buy Guy Raz.
He interviews entrepreneurs and big name business owners about how they grew their companies.
He's had reddit's founders, the dude who built Burton (and basically invented snowboarding), the guy behind Atari and Chuck E. Cheese.
Pretty informative and entertaining.
