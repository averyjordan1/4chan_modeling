Long story short wagecuck >want to improve life>going back to schoolWhat was I’ll make me more money?
Computer science or accounting?
Before some talks shit about getting into computer science I’m very good with python.
I know I need more languages busy still.
Does a CPA make more than a software engineer or programmer?
Is accounting really as boring as they say and the janitor of the business world?
Accounting is fucking dreadful.
I did one unit of it and it was enough.
I have two close accountant friends who literally want to neck now.Computer science/software engineering is the way friend.
Alright thank you.
