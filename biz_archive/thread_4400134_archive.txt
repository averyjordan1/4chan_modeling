I just want to buy some bitcoin with fiat, /biz/, but every fucking place is either charging like 3%, or I have to wait months for them to review my documents so that I'll be able to deposit any money.I'm from the EU, how can I buy bitcoin fast with low transaction fees?
We're talking about 60k USD, I have a hardware wallet, I just can't deposit any fucking money anywhere...
60k you need kyc/aml.
The speedest I tried is Bitstamp.
localbitcoins..
bitcoin >fast>low transaction feesHAHAHAHAHAHA
If you're from the UK I'll trade with you, let me know and I'll set up an escrow on lbc
I would advise you to upload your documents as fast as you can and pay the 3% fee, it's worth it.
You will recover in a couple of weeks.
Just make sure you make an account on a good exchange and that's it.Also you can go to bitcoin.org and look up for an organized event where a lot of buyers and sellers meet in real life.
You can also check localbitcoins.
you suck it up and pay the fees like everyone else.

t-thanks guys, I guess I'll just swallow the fee... we'll see how fast bitstamp is
I only use bitstamp, fast verification and no crashed site when action is heavy.
Reasonable fees too.
Kraken and Coinbase are pure shit.
I've been looking at Kraken and their fees seem reasonable, what's bad about them?I've heard good things about Bitfinex too
Give me that money, I'll invest it for you
