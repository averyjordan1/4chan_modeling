JUST
I-IT WILL BE ALRIGHT
kekglad I managed to sell for only a 10% loss vs ethOnly invested a couple dozen and I made it back in other coins so whatever
No.
Get out you weak handed fuck.
I traded the swings and cashed out half my stack so what I have left now is basically free.
I could lose it all.
Doesn't matter because I already broke even.
Could be worse, could be CFD
any idea when it will moon
Holding heavy bags here as well.
But I've got no options other than to hold, 'cause selling at 50% loss is stupid.We will be listed on livecoin on Wednesday.
Honestly I have no idea about this exchange, but the people in the telegram said this one has bigger volume than kucoin.Don't forget that cryptopia will also list HST before the end of this month.
Cryptopia might be our best hope to break even and stabilize the price, before binance/bittrex comes.Also the team's gonna announce their clients and partnerships in late December.
If these partners are big, we might see people fomoing HST.Iron hands, anon.
The link marines can do this, so can we.
Seven days.
this is why i havent sold.
it if was the average shitcoin, yes i would have sold at a loss.
but HST has potential and anyone who sells it now is dumb and shortsighted.
Correct.If HST was another random useless shitcoin with shitty team, I'd have sold even at 20% or 30% loss.But HST is not a shitcoin, the team is active and therefore it has potential.The chance for this coin to moon and hit $1 or even $2 is bigger than the chance for this coin to dump until zero like confido.If anyone here really doesn't want to hold the bag, sell it at least when you break even after the partnership announcement in December.
