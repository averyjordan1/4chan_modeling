Somewhat newfag here, Is there a margin calculator for bitmex?
Made some good gains and I’m feelin bullish on bitcoin, $1k x100 and bitcoin goes up $1k what’s my profit?
Do never fucking margin trade.Thanks me later.
If you have to ask, don't do it.
Unless you plan on killing yourself soon
I lost 120 xmr right before it went up from 7 dollars earlier this year.
Profit = yCollateral = xLeverage = zPrice increase = mPurchase price = nY= ((x*z)/n)*m 12500 minus fees
Perfect thanks
