Staking ARK vs NEO, which one is better in the long term you think?
Wondering this too.Thinking about reinvesting into NEO prefork
Odn
Does Neo give 10% annual dividents?If not, then Ark is better
ark is kinda for people on the short bus, if you know what i mean.
NEO is for the chads.
Neo is of course better long term
Probably ARK.
Yeah it does.
Sometimes higher even.
Is ARK on a sliding scale?
I don't know much about it.
ARK is faster now, but if I understood correctly, once NEO is maturing as a platform... GAS is going to be really scarce and valuable.
ETP = Yearly 20% or 8% for 1/2 a year.
NEO = Gas is still coolARK = could boom whenever the Whales plan on it booming.
Staking Request is best for long term considering it hasn't mooned yet.
Q2 2018
Honestly I'd bet on NEO because not only does it have a really good return (usually between 10-15%) the import thing will be how a coin holds value.
NEO is already a top coin and it has a much bigger shot of holding and gaining value compared to the shitcoins that give you %20 returns.
Who cares the size of the return if the coin value becomes 1sat...
I'm not sure.
I like them both and hold them both.
if you want stable 10% gains then buy a fucking S&P 500, faggot
