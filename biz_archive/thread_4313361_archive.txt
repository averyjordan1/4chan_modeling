Leave it in btc and it will bleed, buy bch and there a chance it will crash.
Make the right choice friend.
Safest split in ETH and ETCWhen crash comes go to LTC as everyone will be cashing out
why not ltc?
will that bottom out as well?
It wonâ€™t.
When BCH drops but LTC and ETH
it's safe but it's small.
It's been p consistent from what I've seen.I did what op said also.
I moved my BTC to BCH, but BCH is so unpredictable I chickened out and moved it to ETH so it can stay stable while BCH and BTC duke it out.
I put all my eggs in this ETH basket hoping it will moon after this bull shit fork.
Now I feel like I picked the wrong religion.. while bch goes to the Moon were still stuck in hell
