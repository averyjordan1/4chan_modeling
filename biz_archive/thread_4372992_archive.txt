SLIGHT HAPPENING IN 2(TWO) HOURSEverex, Agrello, Monetha meetup at the Toshi Center in Tokyohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWYthghrOdk
Daily reminder that if you support Everex you should be supporting ETP and vice versa.Eric Gu is an adviser on EVX, plus EVX is partnered with Viewfin.
One of the most underrated coins right now.
Canâ€™t wait for biztards to wake up sitting /comfy/
Shitcoin meetup, topic of the day : how to get rid of bags
why shitcoin?
Seriously?
Look at post-ICO performance (both in terms of price and project execution).
These guys all suck.
Everex seems to be doing pretty well in terms of project execution.
It has a working product and its actively seeking more partnerships.Agrello is purposely keeping everyone in the dark for some reason, blatantly refusing to answer pertinent questions.
They drop just enough hints to keep people interested.
Its either a clever scam or a team heavily restricted by their legal board (which is entirely possible considering their mission objective)Monetha is the weakest of the three.I wouldn't say the first two are shit.Also bumpeta 20 minutes
fuck the shittest token Agrello.
those lawyers did nothing but bragging around and fucked investors in the ass
Fair enough, maybe I was unfair in including EVX in the shitcoin list.
DLT and MTH though... definite shit.
this is actually true, completely flying under the radarwas breaking out but got stopped by the sw2x fud the same way walton got stopped by china fud, we all know what happened after that went away>literally meeting with the bank of china next week and no one is talking about it
yeah it's been fucking trash, literally a bagholder now because not even worth taking the time to dump
