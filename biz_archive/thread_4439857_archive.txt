What?
That looks about as efficient as any shelf stacker I see at a store
Now post the one of it doing backflips

Why are we trying to make humanoid robots anyways?
In most cases that's not the most efficient form for the task.
because eventually we're going to fuck this thing, and we don't want it to have wheels
They will.
Ideally they will replace the bugmen.
Bugmen must be squashed!
So it's basically on par with Walmart shelvers?
we dont want it to have wheelsyoure breaking her heart anon
So if I try to fuck a robot a work, is that sexual harassment?
It's destroying company property.
The same as if you jizz on your stapler.1) It's gross2) It's your job to clean that shit off3) Your ass had better not be on the clock
DestroyingI'd say more vandalism than actual destruction

Took me a while to realize
its not surprising at all though, youre just being retarded.
do you need to be able to get a thread through a needle to kill someone?
no.
you just aim and pull a trigger or swing a heavy object at another large object.
either of those things are at least 5x more simple than even putting a box on a shelf.
