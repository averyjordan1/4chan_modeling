Bitfinex knows they cannot pump Bitcoin all the time.
At some point the CME Futures Market will determinate the Bitcoin Price.
Thats why Bitfinex will start buying ETH as there is no CME Futures Market yet.
futures have zero effect on the price/value of BTCit's been mentioned several times that these contracts will only liquidate in fiat
and when ETH doesn't increase dramatically like BTC, will you tards finally shut the fuck up about tether?
