Shilled PWR last week, and a couple of abrasive individuals conducted dump attacks to shake me out.
Then it moons.

My bad for week hands.

Might sit this one out.
Still stinging from being fomo'd in to Neo at ATH, and losing 540 smackers.
4467888How do you guys expect to get your hands on the report right when it comes out if you are not subscribers?
Just curious how we will get to read it right when it comes out?
I want to buy the coin also
It takes usually 15 or 20 minutes for Biztards to take positions.
(Buy in) They then come on Biz and shill it to non subscribers in time for us to make 150 - 200% gains.
It helps them moon it, and it helps us make some bank.
it is POWR
