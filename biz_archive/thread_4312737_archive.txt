The panic is about to start any moment now.
Normies who invested their life savings are going to run for the exits.
The greatest panic in crpyto history will ensue as everybody tries to switch to BCH.
This is going to be so glorious.
TFW BCH might actually take over
>flippening dunno man.
I was here when the difference in marketcaps between btc and ethereum was 20 million.
Every thought Ethereum would take over.
In the end look where we are.Although this might be different since BCH has the same use case as btc but is slightly better.

this is my favorite one, I hope we inscribe it on BTC's tombstone so future generations understand what happened
Just buy litecoin, faggots
Core wanted people to remember big blockers as the bad guys, thankfully you can rewrite history in Crypto.I'm thankful BCH split before segwit so we have an uncorrupted chain.
