Educate me oh wise fag anon, is the volume not there on BTC to sustain this?
>short anything over 8000 up to 8030Every one knows where all the shorts are, they just flash pump it at the right levels just to scare the shit out of the shorts and hilarity ensues.
Why would you trade perp with those high fees?
fees dont matter when you're in profit.
I dont like quarts because fucking h-a-w and ash just jam market buys to stop hunt
TA is rolling bones you stupid fuck.
might as well ask my chicken bones what CVC is gonna do tonight.

We see a stuggle for volume to break out of it's 13EMA on the hourly despite a massive pump, indicating a dump could be coming.
Secondly, if we examine the 4H chart
I literally got payed to do TA at shittigroup aka citigroup before this as well as trading forex.
I would say that TA works about 40% of the time, and the other 15% of the time is confirmation bias.
That equates to 55% win ratio though, so it definitely can make you money.
Do you want me to make a CVC chart?
paid LUL, sorry grammar isn't great pretty late here 
Where did you learn ta?
Mostly self taught, went to school for finance and took a few classes in college on it.
Also 8 years trading stocks and 3 trading bitcoin
Nice,thanks
Accounting or finance?
I've been taking accounting classes recently but looking around at job postings it seems to be a shit market.
I saw a posting on acct temps for a min wage for 2 years experience and a bachelors/associates.
CPA is probably the only way to make money in accounting desu.
Is there a CPA equivalent to finance?
