Anyone here 100% in alts?
Yep.
Currently sitting at about 2 btc in alts, I do want to hold 1 bitcoin longterm and have the rest sit in alts though.
XMR NULS BCHGet fucking mad
Yes.I have literally never held BTC for longer than a few hours.
Yessir.
It's worked for me so far.
Yeah, it's fineIt's not really extremely risky if you diversify into stuff like ark, neo, omg, link, req, 0x, rcn, even ripple, zen and others down the line One of the top shilled coins here will surely moon, and will more than erase any losses from the others.
Very possible most or all coins explode if normies figure out what alts are and start buying
You forget BLOCK.BLOCK will make you rich by Q1 2018.
Pajeet pls go
Call me deluded, but I'm 100% in ARK.
2018 is going to be huge for ARK
No because it's just dumb.
I immediately convert profits into BTC because it's just frustrating to see your alt go up 20% a day only for it to drop 50% the next.
Put profits into BTC to hodl and buy dips
Still accumulating?
cancercoin
what's the point of holding a dinosaur coin, when you have coins that do much more, have faster and cheaper transactions?
it's like still playing a vcr player.
Same.
I dropped all my bitcoin and went ALL in Ark.
yes, LINK REQ and ASTI am the /biz/ meme
no one even cares about AST that much anymore.
LINK REQ ARK is the ultimate biztard.
throw some COSS/KCS for good measure
%100 in LTC.
At least I know the 300 bucks I put in wont get lost.. bought at 52 and its 64 now im holdn to 100!
zec
I'm holding AST because I unironically believe in it's potential
I've never had Bitcoin for any period longer than 15 minutes.
yea$VIA$ETC$COSSi have 8BTC now and my exit plan is to go all in btc once i hit 10
LINK, REQ, and SALT
Im down overall -44% on all the altcoin positions>Tenx -60%>QTUM -40%
im in iota, power ledger and verge.i think all the verge stuff is pure larping.
it's hardly moved in the last 2 days
Hell yes, ALTs are back!!!!!
You forgot odn
Yep
yes, because the only reason bitcoin has value is due to the exchanges forcing you to use it to buy alts and apparently its "brand" and "notoriety".
Once exchanges don't force you to go through bitcoin, we'll see how much that brand equity is actually worth, but I doubt it will be enough to justify the price.
req link odn bmci am full meme
currently all on REQ rnit will probably be the next chainlink, so i gotta sell at it's high
Desu I am 100% in Vertcoin and so far made more gains than 99% of /biz :))
lots of exchanges allow you to use eth :)
it is called BLOCKCAT faggot
Yes.
I feel like an idiot.
Tenx... why did I ever buy that shit?
yes, I know this.
When I got into crypto I actually bought ETH instead of bitcoin.
If I did it, others will too.
This will only get worse for bitcoin in time.
The only question is how much bitcoin's brand equity is worth.
Only time will tell.
I'm more of a fundamentals guy so I'm not confortable holding something that has value only because people say it has value.
yes, would have more gains if i kept my btc.
i got all my btc for nothing tho in 2014 so.... still.
I find it's much less stress to buy at least a symbolic amount of anything and everything I hear of, and just put more on those i know about and believe in..My portfolio is a sad 0.38 BTCthis is my bittrex by order of BTC valueLitecoin LTC 3.001OmiseGO OMG 22.606Civic CVC 359.755Factom FCT 5.248Ark ARK 24.539Gnosis GNO 1.0Ubiq UBQ 50.733Pivx PIVX 18.173TenX Pay Token PAY 31.0Bancor BNT 28.000Komodo KMD 18.0Qtum QTUM 3.50I/OCoin IOC 13.349Bytes GBYTE 0.20Nexus NXS 34.132Diamond DMD 4.0Basic Attention Token BAT 229.299eBoost EBST 48.379Monero XMR 0.30Neo NEO 1.0Lisk LSK 5.00Lumen XLM 811.487NAVCoin NAV 31.0ZCash ZEC 0.118Salt SALT 7.000Waves WAVES 5.50Monaco MCO 4.0Decentraland MANA 1700.0Mysterium MYST 42.533Particl PART 2.500LBRY Credits LBC 133.937NewEconomyMovement XEM 108.523SysCoin SYS 90.177CloakCoin CLOAK 3.50CLAMs CLAM 4.0StealthCoin XST 90.0Firstblood 1ST 55.0Augur REP 1.0FunFair FUN 1079.260Ripple XRP 87.071Vertcoin VTC 3.597Zclassic ZCL 9.80Golem GNT 82.0Melon MLN 0.30ZCoin XZC 1.0Ardor ARDR 69.0PotCoin POT 128.537Bitcoin BTC 0.00025258Siacoin SC 3500.000Stratis STRAT 4.183STEEM STEEM 15.00AdEx ADX 13.915BitBay BAY 524.689Patientory PTOY 80.00Ethereum Classic ETC 1.00Wings DAO WINGS 31.00OmniCoin OMNI 0.505Decred DCR 0.40Edgeless EDG 20.00Verge XVG 1500.00Expanse EXP 6.000SolarCoin SLR 29.801 METAL MTL 2.000STORJ STORJ 20.00Digibyte DGB 1000.00Ada ADA 350.000Dogecoin DOGE 8625.052Dash DASH 0.0300BitcoinDark BTCD 0.069Voxels VOX 200.000GameCredits GAME 4.00Gulden NLG 80.000Aragon ANT 4.000NXT NXT 80.000Lomocoin LMC 92.343MonaCoin MONA 1.50MaidSafeCoin MAID 8.849OkCash OK 12.050Rise RISE 9.000Ethereum ETH 0.004Tether USDT 0.00034547I also have a binance with some iota, substratum, link, EOS, 0x, Districs 0x, Kyber network, enigma, btcoin cash and bitcoin gold, Iconomy, Walton coin, and some more NEO, LTC, salt, ark, stratis and OMG.Am i smart or dumb?
Yes.
VIA, EXP, RLC & TOKENLAB.
Pretty dumb desu
What do you want for dinner?>Idk what do you want?You, probably
It's a nice thought, but you're really just holding a stack of coins that won't exist in the next 6 months.Do you find it easy to manage that amount of alts?If I'm going to single one out for you, drop omise.
Omise is by far the biggest meme of a coin shilled on this board, too many deluded thinking its going to be the next of the big 3, when in reality its going to continue to tank until its below a dollar
retard
Obviously i get out of everything when i smell a bear market and go to USDT and then buy back a whole new portfolio when their all lowbut this way you never live with that constant stress of fearing to miss a moon mission or obsession to research and figure out the real moon missionsXD i hardly know what any coin does, i sometimes try and figure out the general idea but mostly i just gauge the amount of enthusiasm around each coin and go by that..I know i'll end up with less money, but it's a lot less stressful like this, trust me..also the first 20 coins are a huge majority of the portfolio, the rest are tiny amounts, so i'm not really throwing around that much of my money..
Me.ETH, ZEN, BAT, XMR, XLM, LSK, FCT, LTC, I only have a little BTC to trade around with as liquidity.
Hello.
even ripple, zentop kek
lol good one
all my portafolio its on tradesatoshi.im holding piggy, jesus, btcz, pac, ldoge, about 1.43 BTC value on shitcoins.im a shitcoiner
so stupid, remember that stupid mouse thing and the altcoin posts we had here everyday for like 2 months?
that was for people like you.
4263730XD yepBut i'm way to lazy to do any research.. it's just not gonna happen, there are waay to many coins and I ain't got the time, I just go by the how sincere and logical the shills soundHow sarcastic were you?
I have no idea what ur talking aboutbeen here like 2-3 months
I'm 100% in Bancor.
Another 100% arkARKIES UNITE
yeah im 100% in altsbytecoinvertpower ledgerverge
The exact opposite of what i'm doingI wonder how many %returns more than me you'll end up withI'ts a lot more of a gamble that way, but if bancor is as solid as the shillers say it's probably a lot
good thing about alt is, im in australiaso because of the time difference, i wake up to a huge profit as you guys are going to sleep.
This is how a woman would invest.
Time to lay off the soy.
90% eth 10% xrp
basically long term Alts on average always tank, while btc always rises.
XD how progressive of you
SHABOOEY IS MY BLESSING FOR ALTS.
TRIPS CONFIRM.
uuuum..waht?remember may?june?granted now they are super over extended and were fucked by the imaginary fork but many alts did amazing last two market cycles compared to BTC

Terrible
The picks or the strategy?
Bubble confirmed
Obviously altcoin and shitcoins especially are a bubblebut it's not popping yet, and when the market goes past 220B-225B i start moving everything to USDT
17 BTC alts only
Got 90 grand in alts and 10 in btc.
Feels good
kinda both.
dumbIt doesn't work and just got hacked badly, probably inside job.
They staked crazy amount of coins with no fee
I'm 90% REQ right now.
Sold off my remaining link and ODN bags to basically go all in on this bitch- bought most of it at ICO and then stocked up at around 0.00013-14 so I'm actually in the green as it stands right now.
ark, ark
just relax completely.
2018 you'll be rich as shit.
ODN is weighing heavy on me too.
I don't know why this doesn't do shit.
100% Ardor
anyone still holding more than 10% BTC after the fork news doesn't deserve to make it.
price prediction per coin eoy 2018?
Hahahaha dude, ODN is the best coin to have this year and next year.
This thing will blow up so hard.
DON'T SELL ODN.
Dunno m8, iOS messenger app is coming out in december but I'm not sure if anyone is really gonna give a shit.It's entirely possible that ODN is gonna blow the fuck up in 2018 as well, and the upside is pretty huge given the low ass marketcap, I just thought that REQ was a much surer bet, since that is pretty much guaranteed to become huge by q1-q2 2018.
Yes.
All-in since $6.30 or rather around 90k sats.Fully expecting this to go triple digits in 2018.
Learned my lesson after tryimg to trade around to increase my stack, and realized it won't work because I was trading with emotions, worrying about whether this would moon while I had my money in shit.Believe in this 100%, just need to survive for a year and I'll be done with waging and going on vacations around the world.Want to get to an even 2k though.
All in req and wanchain.
Since wanchain is not released yet I just put 6.8eth (amount of purchased wanchain)Kinda annoyed missing on ripio 2x while req struggles still below ico.
I was initially planning to flip req for 1.5 or 2x then buy ripio and flip that at 2x.
Then bitcoin gold scam fork fucked everything.
Oh well I already have my next opportunity to double up the 3-4K safely lined up.I was also planning to open margin trading long positions on neo and maybe others a few hours before s2x fork but that got fucking cancelled.
Doing shit like this is much much crazier than my mindless strategythat's literally almost the same as gambling, or taking all your retirement funds and buying lottery tickets..
No, margin trading on nothing but TA is gambling.
Buying hyped icos with solid partnerships and teams is generally very profitable.
what do you expect req's price would be per token in the long term?
youre pretty much 50/50 req and wanchain.
I'm 70% in daytrading Bitbay and making a lot of gainsTurned 480 euro into 1000 euro
lol your entire portfolio is 0.38 btc- no doubt you're going to see some decent gains in the long run but you're wayyy overdiversified.
You need to make some informed gambles if you want to see the big gains that you need to turn your portfolio into a meaningful amount of moneyI started off with around 1500 euro or so and gambled hard on some solid ICOs- first Kyber, and then Chainlink to get where I am right now.
If I'd just chilled and hodl'd a million shitcoins I'd probably barely be breaking even (I'm at 10k euro right now).
I have 170k REQ- I honestly believe this project could 10x by q2 2018 if they hit their milestones, and even more by 2019 if their marketing and sales efforts means that the transaction volume of Request starts reaching meaningful amounts.Yes I'm fucking gambling, but the potential upside for REQ is fucking huge so I'll take this bet any day of the week- if this comes through in the next year or two I can honestly put myself in a position to set myself up for life, while you'll still be holding on to 30 shitcoins that have maybe 5x'd in total in that same timeframe.
Pretty dumb
Imagine how this guy does his taxes when he cashes out.
70%link 10% ardr req nuls
Lmao, meanwhile while you>get fucking poor
Please tell me you're joking.Holy fuck PLEASE
You pay transaction an withdrawal fees for all those separate coins?Alright this is officially a troll, NO ONE is that retarded.
I'm 50% in it tooI see the writing on the wall.
XMR and ZEN only for mecomfy as fuck
Yes.
Mostly ETH and NEO.Huge FOMO for Bitcoin, want to get back to daddy.
Nopewhy should i??
as of now I'm 33% on just the last two days, it's just a lot of buying and selling to do every time the market reverses a trendNo withdrawal fees, i just keep it on bittrex and have 2FA enabledTransaction fees go by percentage do it makes no difference..
This is my story as well.
Stood on the sidelines watching Bitcoin rise from 30 cents to a thousand, because the idea of digital money backed by nothing but confidence in its algorithm sounded iffy at the time.
Then I saw an article on Ethereum last March and things clicked.
Programmable money makes so much more sense.
Bought ETH directly from Coinbase.No idea why the autists give you a hard time.
Probably the day-trading ride shitcoins pump and dump mindset.
I'm used to VC investing and likely made more money than 90% of /biz/, and I play it like you with half of my portfolio.
Crypto is full of highly asymmetrical opportunities.
Most tokens will crash to 0, but the few that go x10, x20, x100 in value more than make up for it.
Yep 80% Ltc, 15% SALT and I'm bag holding 5% in BAT I might jump back into bit coin but not at these inflated prices.
May also buy some monero off a friend who mines it and does local trades.
