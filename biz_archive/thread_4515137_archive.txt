After I've seen the FOMO of a coin with potential use... unlike you retarded linky dinky bag holders... how would this coin work in the gaming ecosystem?
How does a developer reward players?
How are the reward scales decided?
How the fuck does it work at all
potential useLMFAONo.
This coin, along with 99.999% of alts are vaporware scams.
They will NEVER be used in any real ecosystem.
The devs just spew buzzword nonsense to trick brainlets into "investing in the tech".
