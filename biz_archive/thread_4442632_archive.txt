A lot of people invested in this crap and lose a lot of money and instead of cut the losses they're still shilling it.
LMAO
Anyone that sold Link at a loss deserves to fail at crypto.
It is the most guaranteed moon shot I've ever seen
seriously.
i can't believe there are still people who choose to own 0 LINK atm
only if its not a scam.
good luck on that bet
If they've scammed Ari Juels, Sony, AXA, BNP Paribas, Santander, Barclays, SWIFT, Capgemini, World Economic Forum, etc etc then they're the best damn scammers out there.
you have no real proof theyve worked with any of those people
ari juels co-authored the peer-reviewed whitepaper so there's that.
as for the rest sergey somehow managed to make them pay attention by writing articles and reports about them, some going as far as giving out data to try out their poc tech.
i am 100% certain however that this is a scam, actually amazed at sergey for pulling this off.
glad i didnt buy into this shitcoin btw
Maybe they want profits now?Deluded
