>Be me>Wait 30 mins for my buy order to fill>Price keeps rising, fomo kicks in>Buy at market price>Happy and tell myself that I bought at a good price mins later price drops far below my previous buy orderWhy does this keep happening to me, /biz/?
Am I destined to be poor forever?

buy when its red in the negative on a good hunch and wait.
crypto trading is very high risk my bro.
alt coins are higher risk.this is almost gambling... you have to be careful and buy while its cheap, not while you see it mooning.
Do not buy when its mooning, simple.
this is almost gamblingIt IS gambling.
In fact I consider some sports betting safer than this.
That's part of the fun though.
Crypto is still new and still has lots of potential to skyrocket if you just so happen to play your cards right.
Fun!
