TRX thread ~~ Who is holding?Who is ready for the upcoming listing?
Bumping own thread.I strongly believe in it.
It's only 32 stats right now.
Will be on one of the major exchanges shortly.
The risk/reward ratio is great.
I dunno.
Holding 1MM.
What listing?
It's on Binance already, big enough.
Long hold, project is still in its infancy.
Same feels here.
I only bought 30k, hoping it swells in a year or soI’m digging the fact that it’s not being mindlessly shilled yet
your attention span must be short, it was shilled to fuck last Thursday.
Rumour mill is Bittrex.
No coin really stays in the Top 50 for too long without being listed on it, so I feel pretty confident.
I'm holding 1.44MM.
I feel like it will follow a path like Stellar did.
or it's possible I'm not here 24/7what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bonafide shitcoin like chainlink yet
