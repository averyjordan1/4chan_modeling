No I don't want to mine it now, in the future I would like the possibility though.
MNX>tradable on livecoinmillion supply>still mineableThe team developed a mechanism to reduce volatility, to provide a secure and stable method of payment.
Also, since the price is below their 2017 target price of $20, they provide you 5.7% interest WEEKLY just for keeping MNX in your wallet and not spending.I got in at $3.50, also mined some coins and now the price is stable at $11, also got weeks of 5%+ compounded interest, one of my best investments this year.
to reduce volatilityInto the trash it goes, I want to make money here mate.
