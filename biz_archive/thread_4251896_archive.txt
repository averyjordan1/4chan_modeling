Buy bitbay for a x3 at least
ok but when?
In a few days once it goes back down like it always does... then u wait for the pump.
BITBAY>developer holds over 100 million bitbays in his personal wallet, which is 10% of the supply>outdated wallet>marketplace looks like its from the early 90's>marketplace constantly crashes, is buggy, god awful UI and its resource hoarding as all hell>you are not allowed to sell child pornography, guns, illegal drugs or fake money on the marketplace, which would be the only reason to actually use a decentralized marketplace>developer will most likely cash out and disappear once he can sell his coins at 0.10$literally a pyramid coin, no thanks
if i bought in at 370 am i going to get JUST'd then?
you already are, my friend
No but around 350 is even better ;)
you are not allowed to sell child pornographyfuck right off
You post this in every BAY thread...
