Can you guys not do math?
When BTC drops your investments lose value idiots.
Lets say one ZERF is worth .5btc when bitcoin is 8kThat 1zerf is worth half a bitcoin or 4k usdNow btc drops to 4k, assuming that ZERF remained the same, is worth 2k but still .5btc.
Can you fucking brainlets do math?
Bitcoin going down= alts lose in value even if they go up in satoshis
Because it will eventually recover and we can buy everytime it crashes,
i dont care about the btc ratioim here to make money, not buttcoinsand i store my profits in eth which is actually a store of value as it never dips below its floor for long, and is on a massive rally atm
Because the difficulty drops from miners dropping out and mining it gets easier, if even slightly.
Because we all think BTC will recover even higher retard.
You think this is the top?
ETH is the flagship of hacker-friendly shitcoins, enjoy losing all your money.
This desu.
If you trade using ETH you'll never get the kind of shit you get from BTC
Thinks that /biz/ as any impact on the crypto currency market>other than really really shit lower than shit coins that only two people own
Because they're disgusting cashies and BTC is inversely correlated to their investment.
It's almost like every singe thing of value in the world is measured in terms of USD or other fiats.BTC ratio is a useful figure to know, but you are delusional if you think that's all that matters.
You have to move like a ninja in these market, son.
Learn to tether in safety at moments.
Even when some vendor accepts BTC or another coin, they always set he crypto price based on the equivalent fiat price at the time.
my point exactly
