explain what's the point of holding ethereum tokens like link instead of ethereum.
Because Ethereum tokens let the block chain perform tasks other than "give/receive ethereum"
but ethereum will always be the daddy and as more projects pop-up demand for it increases isn't it?
There isnt, invest in unique ones like eth itself and stuff like QTUM
