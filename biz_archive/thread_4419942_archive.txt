WHATS WRONG WITH ME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI KEEP FUCKING PUTTING 0.05 BTC ON ALL MY FUCKING BUYS.
I bought NEO at the very bottom only for 0.05 for 50% gains today wow I made so little, I have 0.5 btc btw.
Then I buy NULS for 250% gains wow I made nothing on my 0.05 investment again, I did this for litterally so many coins for great fucking gains but I'm too pussy to put in more than that.
I feel like the moment I put more than 0.05 btc the coin will go to hell.
I've made it from 0.3 to 0.5 btc past week but I'm not going to make it at this rate, I need to put more.
Is there any advice to take before I foward this into my stratagy?
