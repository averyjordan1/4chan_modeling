Instead of cashing this golden goose for the next decade to come, and everyone here going to make it, they saw a few hundred 100$s and decided to promote killing off all of crypto.I knew greed would destroy this market, but stupid irrational greed, willing to kill the goose for everyone including yourself... that's just 4chan-level stupidity.We all know this party was going to end.
But to shit in the middle of the dance floor and then celebrate your minor gains... fucking hell.
I'd love some BCH as well if you've got some to spare, thanks anon3J4KBPMr7oSqWp9YfitXsUxUjK9Yob3ciX

4315150You're an imbecile if you think /biz/ had any influence on these massive market movements.

Smart shilling OP.
You know that some zero-wage cucks are going to create a massive influx of BCC addresses when you feign Robin Hood.
This metric (combined with the online posting of BCC addresses and topics) will influence another big part of the decision makers in this market.It's all so very fucking sly and capitalist, I get a feeling that Bitcoin already lost: This is a market for sharks now, much like stocks in the 80s.
Decentralized when it matters, but centralized with a few players holding massive amounts of crypto.Fucked.
Up.
secretly, BIZ runs the worlds economies..
chan in general?
Absolutely.
It's the little meme bubble that spawns normie Youtube videos that are watched millions of times every month.
This very thread is indexed and analyzed by at least 5 big hedge funds.
And I know paid shills exist, because I used to pay bizrealis in crypto to shill on pol.

Give me your address, you sound like an intelligent man.
I will send you 1 Bitcoin (cash).
Everyone else, patience, due to the numbers it will take me a little to get to all of you, but I will be sending you guys small amounts to keep you satisfied.
Does begging for coins every work on /biz/?
i never see any proof
That dump was a bear trap.
How many of you soft handed cucks just dropped your bags for eggs?
At least I can hope.
