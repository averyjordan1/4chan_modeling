did biz miss out on the ongoing mooning that has been happening today?
sure buddy
my condolences
Having averaged down far enough to be at break-even currently.
:feelsgodfam:
For some reason I always thought that AST and ASTRO are the same thing
Airswap is still a useless shitcoinIt is trading at 64% of its ICO ETH price
How is a decentralized exchange useless?
dude.
AST is one of the best coins.if you own it you get to be in VIP-clubs and do OTC-trading.If you own 10k AST, you can buy cheap tokens in special clubs for the rest of your life.it is literally the best investment.
I just broke even too thanks to doubling up at 19 cents.
I wanna sell so bad.
