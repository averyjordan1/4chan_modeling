I'm going all in lads, wish me luck
Do you know that the developers have already commented that the rumors they were divulging about the partnership with Mastercard and Visa are false, as well as the rumor of being listed on Bittrex?
What's the market cap?
You know that, do not you?

Apparently 65% of tokens we're available for the ico (650 000 000 QSP).
It's probably a little bit less.
With current price (around $0.145) i would say it's around 90m-100m.
Hmm, i'm going to buy thanks
