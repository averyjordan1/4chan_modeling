Fuck I hate Bitcoin.
We are as ants, contemplating the size and scale of the entire planet.
Once you realize is bitcoin is the fucking honey badger, you will understand that the wisest investors are the ones who hoddle with the shaolin grip.
the fuck.
too bad i don't have any BTC on an exchange for a pump and dump
>tfw holding 3 bitcoin since $3000i nailed my hands to the wall, it was the only way to make them strong enough
True.
All you had to do in life was buy and hold you stupid morons.
You could cough up a few satoshis for a kung-fu training device to work on your hand muscles and achieve lethal grip strength.
every time it "crashes" it immediately comes back and makes a new ATH.
amazing.
Waiting for the tether crashIf there is no crashI'm free and will never return
HONEY BADGER DONâ€™T CARE
Look at the volume.
It's USDT/BTC pairs leading the rally.
People are converting Tether to BTC as quickly as they can.
tfw didn't buy the dip because I thought it's gonna crash more
God damnit you went in with the same amount of capital as me but you did it when I was buying silver like a fucking retard and now I'm only at like 88% gains so far.
Bought in September JUST
Pretty much.
We're reaching a point where it could reach 10k before december
