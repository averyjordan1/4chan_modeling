It's a shitcoin though.
It looks promising on the surface, but read the whitepaper really really carefully with good attention to detail and think hard about it and you'll understand.Will be good for a pump and dump though.
Easy 3x and dump then buy back in before alpha release for another 2x.
Poorfags can't see past 2-week timeframes
what's involved in a whitelist, this is the first i see mentioned like this, very new.
when it says intended contribution does that mean I am inevitably pledging 1 ETH or more, or can I use an empty ETH address?
its not a contract, you just use any ETH address and your email, are you retarded?
thanks
I can't find reason why it is shit token, what do you think, how big gains with flipping it
will i still receive the 10 IGNT if I skip parity?
Don't have ether to verify...

You guys have any suggestions for a good VPN?
How do I whitelist?
Website doesn't have anything for that.
