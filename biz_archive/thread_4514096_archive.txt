Say you had 100-200k to spend on mining equipment.
What would you buy?
Wait for the 7nm ASIC rigs or use BITMAIN?1000 Dogecoin to someone who points me in the right direction.
Dont bother just buy btc
So if you had $200k to spend, why would you say you only have $100k to spend?Go over there ->\\_
Id get 50 BW L-21 ASIC miners, probably make 1250 a day 1k profit and only need maybe 200 amps if you do it right.
Just buy btc fool.
btc is going down fool
