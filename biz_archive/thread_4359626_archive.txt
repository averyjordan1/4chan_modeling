RCN MOON!!
Whats the story on this?
Seen this talked up quite a bit on Twitter def potential for quick gains.
If either ENJ or ARN moon enough tonight for me to pull out with at least 2x I'll be tempted to put into this.
RCN is a credit network out of South America Please be quite and delete thread I'm still buying while they're under $1 FFS it's already mooning on it's own I don't need threads here.
