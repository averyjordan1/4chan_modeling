Astronaut (ASTRO) has launched on Etherdelta, days earlier than the first exchange listing is due.ASTRO is a dividend earning token run by Picolo Research, who will invest the funds raised in the ico in new icos and crypto ventures.
Token holders will share a quarterly dividend of 50% of profits, with 40% being reinvested to increase Astronaut's earning capacity.
Picolo has a proven track record of making high return picks throughout the ico boom so far: ZRX, EVX, LINK, DNT.The best part is, there's only 4 million tokens in circulation, as 46 million were burned after not being sold during ico that went under the radar.
That means more shares earned per coin.
In December they'll launch their app and pay the first dividend too.https://astronaut.capital/https://etherdelta.com/#0x7b22938ca841aa392c93dbb7f4c42178e3d65e88-ETH
