DOVU
LBC, the coin used for the LBRY platform, only $.14 each, worth far more than that as a decentralized YouTube replacement.

Unikorn Gold (UKG) sitting on etherdelta right now at 60% of ICO price.
There were no presale discounts and Mark Cuban is heavily invested in this.
It's getting listed on a MAJOR exchange in next 2 days.
Guaranteed moon.
Mark Cuban is heavily invested in thisRead as: Avoid like plague.
coss
Enjin Coin is my bet, currently half of pre-ICO ($0.02) price.
Considering it will be the main currency of in game items for Minecraft plus MMO SDK, $1 is nearly guaranteed by late 2018.
It'll get pumped again in a few days
Nuls.
second part AMA today.
Below 1$, 40m circulating supply.

in the last AMA they answered 1 question.
1.
Do you really think kids can get into the coin game, kekEnjin coin crashed down to 1/10 ico price
Wow, amazing!
Everyone is saying a different coin without any actual consensus on which one is "going to the moon".
Either every coin is going to the moon.
Or no one knows a thing about which coin is going to the moon.
Or they are lying and want you to purchase their own coin in the hopes that it will go to the moon.
Wow, just amazing!
Sad!
All coins you've never heard of on scam exchanges you would never trade on because they'll shut down in 2 months time.
Nuls
NEOG on Mercatox.
It's 2 cents now and is hitting 3 more exchanges in the next 3 weeks.

RDNCheck it
They have the Elephant elefun partnership, honestly it can only go down hill from there.
FLIP probably in the next few weeks.
Though that's probably a long time to wait in crypto.
Not sure if solid for short term, but Digibyte is releasing a fully detailed new website.
POWR

VIBE.
It's not just below $1, it's below $0.10.
MC is below $6M.
They partnered with Monster Technologies recently, the guys who were behind Beats by Dr Dre.
Apparently Monster Technologies has a $4B a year revenue.
Also VR will blow up in a big way when Oculus releases the GO, and forces HTC to become competitive.
Plus source code was leaked for VR support for the Nintendo Switch.
And Nintendo tend to do pretty well in the hardware market.

Syscoin.
It's gonna happen.
Switching from PoW to PoW AND PoS in the next day or so... people buying up coins to open masternodes will jack up the price.
Ah if true I have dumped too soon
This Wolf dude is such a massive faggot on Twitter and on Bitmex.
Agreed, but the switch is about to happen.
If nothing else buy the hype...
funfairBeta release in January.Expect the MOON
lmao it has no chance of going big because of a fatal flaw.
If it does indeed get big due to the stupidity of people in crypto, big eth miners will simply prioritise their own tx before anyone else , removes the "randomness" aspect of getting block reward, and when PoS is implemented, guy with the most eth can simply get all bitcoinereum

But Decent (DCT) now or regret it forever.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decent/

HST.
