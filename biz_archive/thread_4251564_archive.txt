Bitcoin is still used to buy and sell drugs.
When will you normies realize that all other alt coins literally is just a pump and dump scheme?
Nothing except bitcoin provides a real value right now in society.
Be smart.
Invest slowly in bitcoin.
Be happy and grateful for what you have.
Or else greed will wreck your ass, like it did with me.
But I am back with more understanding and gratefulness for what I have.
Wait, so you're telling me that I'm not actually debt free because of ETH gains?
Time to go break the news to my wife.
btc is shit for drugsyou have to tumble it a lot to hide traces and it is slow and expensivei hope monero will totally replace it
When people tell you nothing is being used but bitcoin when its the complete opposite .....No shit 95% of cryptotraders lose money in this easy money game.
If this is your argument, you should be all in XMR.
