Isn't that really fucking weird>shitloads in USD tether and no other currencies>US customers with USD banned
USD rules the world
>US customers with USD bannedBecause US doesn't want you plebs making money without them getting to control it.But for real wasn't that done because bitfinex doesn't want to comply with some US rules they have to follow if they serve US customers?
Tethers are great because you get to anchor your value to fiat without paying taxes.
literal wash funding scheme
Fake dollars do they ban real us citizens so they will never have problems with Feds.
Also decentralized market.
Holy shit what a scam, how long will this last before trump intervenes?
