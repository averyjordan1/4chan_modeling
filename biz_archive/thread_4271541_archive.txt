Anyone take nuls gains?I made 400% and took profit.
I'm not greedy.I am a jew tho.did anyone tip op from the orignal thread?

I think selling NULS is a mistake you should hold until at least Monday.
If anything I'd be BUYING NULS right now if I wasnt already all in.
UH... idk.
I feel fine.
If anything reenter with your initial investment and keep your 300%
NULS proves that the pump and dump potential of absolute buzzword vaporware scammy seeming shitcoins is still big and strong.
