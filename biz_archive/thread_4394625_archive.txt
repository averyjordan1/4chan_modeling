Ok, how the fuck do I use EtherDelta?
reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6hrxjw/etherdelta_guides_for_first_time_usersIf you can't figure it out after reading those guides, don't use EtherDelta because you'll probably end up one dumbasses that sells 87 GVT for 8.5 ETH like I saw last night.
send some eth there and try shit thats how i learned itits a piece of shit but you dont need an acc
1) Open Account2) Save Account and Password(2a maybe make a Copy of account and password)3) Choose Coin to trade4) Transfer ETH to Deposit (Account)5) Tranfer (NOT ALL) ETH to Etherdelta (Leave enough for transfer fees otherwise your ETH is lost in Etherdelta)6) Create buy / sell order or click one of the buy/sell offers and enter how much you want to trade of it.7) Transfer exchanged coins from Etherdelta to Deposit.8) Transfer coins from deposit to your vallet.ATTENTION nearly all transation cost ETH and it has to be in your deposit not in Etherdelta.
Otherwise your funds will be lost.
(Gasprice can be changed in settings if I remember correctly).
account number and password can b e used the next time you want to use etherdelta.
Is this the shitiest of the exchanges or what the fuck?
Yes.. stay away retard.
