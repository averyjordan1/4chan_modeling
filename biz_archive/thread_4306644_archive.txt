@.0046 eth atm or $1.45- Only latency solution on ethereum atm- Also only scaling solution (I believe plasma will be the next one out)- Token is being integrated into the use of the tech, so as the tech sees use the token's value goes up- Project has tons of development done.
Literally just have to look at their documentation/github/examples to see that they are actually making something useful.Only way this project fails is people boycott it and don't use it.
This is highly unlikely due to it being the only payment channel solution for ethereum coming out in the near future.This is probably a decent investment compared to other coins.
Main exchange is binance atm, but probably going to become listed on many more exchanges in the near future.
They arn't even tweeting/blogging about listing on these exchanges to FOMO their token.
