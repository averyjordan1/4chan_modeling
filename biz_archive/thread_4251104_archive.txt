oh my god.
LINK FUDers absolutely BTFOed
>everything is mooning>linkfags acting like they're the only onesjust enjoy this my dude
it's mooning far harder than other coins, you simpleton
except it isn't you newfag
percentages must be difficult for you
you must not realize that literally everything has mooned around the same percentage thenbut it doesn't matter since you bought Link at 40 cents anyway
on coinmarketcap it's #2 for 24-hour gain.
LInk is at 61%, next best is at 23%.You know LINK fudding itself is a meme right?
You didnt actually believe that someone with industry backing and dev HEADLING THE BLOCKCHAINSUPER CONFERENCE AFTER BEING SHILLED BY A 18.2 BILLION FIAT BANK were lies...did you?
I'm not fudding link, I'm wondering why Link holders and rubbing this moon in everyone else's face when your coin was one of the main ones that dropped the most due to this fork nonsense
Kekkkkkkkkkkkkkkk dont buy LINK then go on i dare you.
ok?
