Who else here ignored advice to get into crypto years ago?2011 and again in 2014.But now I see the light.Don't tell me it's to late anon.
It's too late.
It's too late anon
not too late but you couldve been a millionaire 3 years ago
Too late everyone on this board posts crypto threads because it's old and outdated, I would say move on
It wasn't too late ... but it is now.
wait for the next big thing
>heard about it when that guy bought a pizza with like 10k Bitcoin >didn't think anything of it and did no research J U S T
Mfw I installed a btw miner on my pc in 2010 ran it for a day and uninstalled it because it made my fan run too loud.It had over 100 something on it and I remember thinking oh thats less than a dollar, this is dumb.Not sure what happened to the wallet.
you would've sold anyway at 1dollar/btc.
It isn't too late.
Crypto won't start getting truly useful (and thus valuable) until around Q2 2018.
Get in fast and strap in.
If you're looking for a safe bet, put it into ethereum primary (not bitcoin).
You can then do your own research on directly applicable cryptoassets and decide what to put some in and what not to.The reason Ethereum is a better stability bet than BTC is because BTC is infested with a very nasty strand of miner politics, is technically inferior and pretty much practically useless.
It's only big because it's big.When Ethereum goes proof of stake (late this year or early next) it might even cause the great flippening and overtake BTC's position as #1 marketcap.
Most of the worthwhile projects/tokens also run on ethereum's chain and users will need to pay ethereum for transaction fees.
Same here.Sad thing is I actually enjoy collecting real-world items.But crypto completely flew over my head.Whatever...Better late than never, I guess.
