Listen Brainlets,Every single time XVG drops this low it pumps 30% minimum.
Do you think BTC will give you 30%?
We're not buying your bags.
XMR is king.
Should I go for it?
This.
The scam has finally been played out.
No one is falling for it anymore.
I've traded XVG in the past but I won't touch it now.
Why would it go up, for any reason besides "it always does" - in the past, XVG's pumps revolved around 'muh Wraith Protocol' rumour.Why should I not believe this shitcoin is dead in the water?
SameI'm ashamed that it took so long until I researched it.

I've made so much money off this coin, fuck everyone in this thread fudding, I'm going to keep buying the dips for this coin.
4454948How exactly does the scam work?
Do you know of any similar scams where you can very easily buy low, wait a couple weeks, and sell high?
I'm interested in these types of scams.
I'm the type of guy that prefers chadmagnets
