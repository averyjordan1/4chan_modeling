Repeat after me:"Buy high, sell low",that's the way we roll.FUD the pumpso, the coin I'll dump.The Lambo I lust,but the wallet JUST.Short the bull,long the bear.Leverage for lull...Dreams into thin air!Even a tiny drop and I fold!No rebounce to my weak hands..."Trend's changing!
Set the strong hold!
",My bad!
It forever descends...The whale is Yellow,the dollar is green.Pink Wojak fellow,hold this bag you're so keen.
It physically pains me to think of you patiently working on this before posting
I like it anon, good job.
