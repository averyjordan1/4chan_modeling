I thought the crash would've been different, but right now I'm happy that normies are losing their life savings.
I'm holding zero BTC, so this isn't salt talking, but why the fuck are you glad that wagecucks who tried to make a safe investment are having their value shifted over to a bunch of parasites???
?4chan retard nihilism is a bit much sometimes
A tree shades out others to grow
Bitcoin was never a safe investment.
You haven't fucking been here long enough.
Get the fuck off this board or lurk moar.
Of course I'm talking about all the cancerous categories (soccer moms, bitconnect money tree enthusiastic, "muh free money" retards, etc) that jumped on the crypto train in the last few months.Feel bad for cool dudes that were trying to make in during the last year and are getting fucked by forks and chinese scum brat.
chan is the home of mankinds rejects, and that includes terribly retarded people as well.The people that are happy about this BCC P+D were the same idiot children who always chose the "piece of candy right now" instead of the "3 pieces of candy tomorrow" option.They will make some peanuts on BCC today, but the future of crypto is fucking gone.
Anyone that brought bitcoin under $1000 should not be worried.
I am just here shitpositng hedging on altcoins.
