ok so I've lost like 90% in cfd.Between planning to murder cfd funders and myself I would like to invest in an ICO with my remaining funds.
Is there any active ICO with a chance of being above ico price when it hits market?
ideacoin maybe?
what do u guys think
thoughts on latium?
backed my john mcaffee
sub, rdn.
Both will shoot in December.
That's pretty fucked up.The worst mistake you can make, is to lose your remaining funds, while investing in an ICO.
That would be suicide.
The smartest way to invest in any great project, is after their ICO, when they're just being listed on an exchange, before being listed on coinmarketcap.I just invested in TIO.For more info follow this link:  Good luck,bro.
GIZER (gaming token I think) got very highly rated in Hacked ICO analysis.
Engrypgen is also promising and aimed at serving a hugely increasing industry (Genomics/Genetic data storage and alaysis/Personal Genome data).
AIRtoken/Airfox has started bouncing back after it dumped to about half ICO price (I was on ICO, sold my bag for 50% loss weeks ago) so could be promising buy in now.
