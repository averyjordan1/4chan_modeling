Just sent all my BTC to be "converted" to Ethereum.
Transaction didn't go through within five minutes (the cunts only give you five minutes its like they forgot that they are dealing with BTC) and now I have to wait days before they refund me.
Never use shapeshift.
What a weak LARP.
Not larp I remember back in may using this shit to change btc to ripple and it also didn’t confirm within the 5 minutes and I had to fucking wait 9 days till I got my funds back.. AND I paid 2x transaction fees.The service works but I wouldn’t use it for anything other than btc>XMR xmr>btc to wash trade your btc if your paying taxes
>changing btc for anything>anything involving a btc transaction>expecting it to go through in 5 minutes, let alone half an hourLmao.That said, shapeshit is pretty shift.
Shapeshifting is great OP is lying to try to make you not sell btc for ETH using the easiest method available
