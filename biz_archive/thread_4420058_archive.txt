Help me out here.
I completely avoided chainlink out of aversion to the hype/fud but recently looked into it.
Binance is the leading volume exchange for LINK.
Has the order book always been this small?
Condensed to 5 decimals to show absolute size.
Anyone have any insights?
you can check it by buying like 100 coins...what you need to do then is to place a very little sell order at:0,000050,000060,000070,000080,000090,00010Binance wont show you the orderbook unless there is action at those numbers.
The coin is still basically unknown outside /biz/ which is why there is so much potential (with risk of course)
Binance wont show you the orderbook unless there is action at those numbers.Are you serious right now?
Holy fuck
Look idiot....
Wtf.
Why is Binance so retarded?
Tf you niggers talking about
Well, I can't tell you why they "hide" the rest of the orderbook but there needs to be action at the hidden stages to let them pop up in the order book.
It there is no movement, they will be hidden to every user that just "steps by" the coin.All you see is the tip of the iceberg.This rule of hide/display crap applies to all the other currencies too.
Maybe you will understand now...
Where are confido fags now?
