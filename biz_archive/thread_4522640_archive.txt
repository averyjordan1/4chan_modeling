People saying it's illegal to sell crypto are incorrect.
It's not illegal because it's not a regulated security.The reason you can sell more for cash in person is because it's dangerous.
People get robbed all the time.
If you're gonna sell on LB, you have to deal with a lot of bullshit and you have to deal with security.
There are a lot of ways people get ripped off, some of which include someone just putting a knife to your gut and demanding you give them the money.
So be careful.
Transact in a public space in the day time where there are cameras.
I personally would carry a gun because it's legal for me to do that where i am.
The short answer for why it's 'more profitable' to sell on LB is because you're taking more risk.
If you're the type of person who can manage this risk you can make a lot of money.
The sort of person who would be well suited for this might be the type of person who could carry out a drug deal without being robbed or suckered.
You have to be the sort of person someone would be afraid to try to rob.
Or at the very least, price your trades so that you can afford to get robbed every now and then.
