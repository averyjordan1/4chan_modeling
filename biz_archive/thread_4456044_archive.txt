Try really hard to not think about a pink elephant.
Did you still think of a pink elephant?Try again, and try even harder to not think about a pink elephant?Still thinking of one?Now instead think about a hot woman.Was it easier to not think about a pink elephant, when you tried not to think about one?
Or was it easier to not think about it, when you were thinking about something else or the hot woman in this case?So here's a tip, when you're going through FUD and FOMO.
It's important to relax and have patience.
In order to do this, you don't want to think about the things that's causing the FOMO and FUD.
But when try to directly not think about it, you'll likely think about it more, kind of like when you try to not directly think about the pink elephant.Therefore what you want to do, is think about something else.
And an easy way to do this, is watch a movie or show, or doing an activity that you personally enjoy.
This makes it much easier to not think about things that's stressing you, and will naturally help to lower the FUD.With less stress, this in turn will make the journey more enjoyable.
And just like sailing, once you reach your destination, you'll likely find other goals, since the true joy comes from the journey.
So don't be overly concerned about reaching the destination, since you'll strive for new goals afterwards.
So relax, have patience, and make the journey enjoyable.1MKVjzrJ8mvd7tFkgR5YwJmT7mhCNQrHPU
