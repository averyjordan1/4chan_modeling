I bought two shitcoins when i started in crypto worth $400, if chainlink doesn't make me rich i will just kill myself.
whilst i hate BTC tx fees this grandadcoin isnt going nowhere but up, it has now entered normieville and theres no going back, $7k again by next friday at the earliest, the chinks know this and are simply accumulating at the retards expense, screencap this shit
Nearly converted all of my FUN into BCH a week ago.
But didn't because I thought FUN was a good project.
Would have had 3.6 BCH.
Now if I tried I would only get 0.72Fuck this gay earth.
