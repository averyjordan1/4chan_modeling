I have an idea for an ecosystem that would allow Crypto holders from anywhere in the world to invest in real world assets such as stocks, bonds, and a few other traditional investment instruments, semi-anonymously (some basic kyc would apply, in order to (((play nice))) ).
My question is: if this service went live, would there be any demand by the crypto-investor community to interact with these others investments?
It seems most crypto holders can already trade/hold the assets I mentioned, would there be any advantages for them to access these markets through crypto, over say, just regular fiat?
I should add that most crypto investors seem to be particularly in crypto because of its volatility and would shun the stability of traditional investments.So my question is there really any interest in crypto for this sort of platform?
liquidity is overrated
I'm in crypto because trading BTC to alt and back is not taxed.
It's only when I convert back to fiat
Incorporate pic related to handle the connections between blockchains, stocks, bonds, commodities and everything else, and you will have a winner.
Exactly.
Even if a platform existed that allowed you to use your crypto gains to invest in real world markets, you would now be exposing yourself to capital gain taxes, and traditional investment taxes.
And most crypto investors seem particularly focused on escaping all of this baggage regulationNot gonna lie, chainlink technology would make the ecosystem a lot less trust reliant and efficient.
But since we don't have decentralized oracles (yet) that doesn't seem feasible.
