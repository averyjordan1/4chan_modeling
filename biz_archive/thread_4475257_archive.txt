so yeah I know no one is gonna give a shit but I'm still gonna put it out here.
It's my own stupid fault, but I just lost 50% of my holdings, of which a big part belongs to my father.
I was going to make him very happy with how much BTC has grown and perhaps buy him an old Triumph motorcycle, but I fucked it up.
If anyone is feeling any sympathy, any donation is welcome.
I'm gonna have to work my ass off to get it together..
But thanks.
Here's my btc adress: 1KP1QAwxqyBMGWYxp2KL9cNy5SUBGXP8sgPlease help..
It's a shame that you think things should come this easy.
No one is going to hand shit to you.
We all have to earn what is ours.
