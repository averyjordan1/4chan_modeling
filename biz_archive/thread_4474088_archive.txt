Went from $800 to $100 thanks to a bunch of shitcoins.
POT was the final blow and now I only have $100 and u can't make shit with $100 but I need $800 back.
Should I just do 100x leverage trading?
Is that the only way?
Gamble.
Dude I got 50 up to 1200 in a couple weeks.
Daytrading or lucky moons?
Fail once on PND, shame on pajeet, fail twice, shame on me.

So what should I do?
If I don't get a response in 5 min I'm sending the rest of my money to bitmex to gamble.
I hate to be harsh but if you just lost most your money in one trade in less that 24 hours you might want to rethink crypto trading.
Let me get this straight.
You are down to 100 dollars from 800?Before I give you a real honest (and hopefully useful) answer, I would like to ask you one more time:Are you larping?
Why would I larp about losing money?
Buy BTC when dip sell when up, wait for dip againalright youtube, that's about all
I have a 5x and a 10x, but can't talk about them openly.
Drop a throwaway
