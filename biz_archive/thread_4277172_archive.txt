Stock tip if anyone actually still has fiat.
Buy Uranium miners.
Cameco just cut supply today.
The price collapsed after fukushima but it is turning around.
The price is so low that nobody can make money so they are cutting supply.
Demand is rising steadily though with China and India building a historic amount of reactors.
Itll take 2 years but you will make 2 to 300 %.
Thank me later.
Love you guys
Don't listen to this faggotI listened to him in 2014 and bought Cameco and have been bag holding ever since.

I LOL when I see my fellow coiners talk about bagholding.
For they do not know the radioactive 3 year bags I've been holding.
I think I turned into the Hulk from gaining so much strength and from the radiation.
