about to buy some link, I ignored the shill threads and it looks like it has decent LONG TERM growth potential.Anyone screaming "$1 by EOFY SCREENCAP THIS" is retarded.But in a year or two I think it might be worth something decent.
And if it's still only worth what it is I learnt my lesson.
Discuss?
If link fails I quit crypto.
I refuse to believe that a gamechanging technology like chainlink fails while a bunch of stickers and a skateboard makes everyone millionaires.
God is dead.
Link is a shit coin.
Buy FENX on ED you idiots.
It's going to at least double next week when it gets officially listed on Exchanges https://etherdelta.com/#0x017188526374f723ec66509ea0c44dd797a33c84-ETHhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x017188526374f723ec66509ea0c44dd797a33c84
they're all "gamechanging technology"
And see?
This is why we can't have serious discussions.
If anyone wants to make a discord to discuss cryptos (no shitty pnds) feel free to post an URL.
I mean, my opinion is invalid because I'm a bcc (BCH) bagholder, But i started this discord recently.
If you just want someone to chat/chill with and discuss crpyto, feel free to join, but any shilling I will probs ban people.https://discord.gg/EBMnjS
