Buy RDN my pajeets.
1-Worth $130M with 0 marketing.2-They have an actual product (they have been working on it for 2 years) and release is in 7 days.3-People will use token as fee to use the network (higher demand), so will follow supply-demand model nicely.
Casinos or decentralized exchanges might implement this.4- Only in 1 major exchange, so far (Binance), so might get added on polo or bittrex with more use (demand from network use).5- Way safer to hold than other projects since Raiden will be the first network upgrade and its competitors are years behind (one started 2 months ago and the other 3 weeks ago)Sell at $4.5-$10.
