It was manufactured by the Islamic jihad!
I keep the hard drive fixed with tumb tacks!
what does it mine, how much it cost and is it profitable?
I missed the pins in the first pic, Jizzuz, it's an atrocity.
ti's are profitable.. they cost like 420 and get ~4.5 Sols per watt, which is great if you pay for electricity.
in english doc
I mined ETH and ZEC with it, also nicehash for a while, got about 2.5 ETH out of it by nowit was like 2,000 bucks, but hardware is expensive in my countryXD don't say that, it's my adorable ugly babythose are 1060 unfortunately, they cost me like 310 bucks each
That's English, with some slight technical jargon mixed in.1070 TIs are the graphics card, obviously, but the "Sols per watt" could use an explanation.
Solutions per watt?
Why would someone mine unless you its your hobby and mine shit coins that can blow up
but then they can not blow upbetter buy eth>make more usd per day>buy the shitcoins
sry better mine* eth
sniff sniffAnyone wanna buy some cheap ODN?
I heard you retards are easy to sell to.
yeah.equihash is measured in sols or solutions.4.5 is bretty good if your payin 4 electric.
i'm giving myself a pretty good lenovo laptop for christmas, probably about $3,000.
don't know if it's the best hardware but i expect it'll at least have a pretty killer graphics card.
is there anything worthwhile i could mine overnight with it?
no no dont even think of itmaybe for a little while but it will heat your machine and fry ittry to get cheap used cards somehow and throw together a rig, 1070s are really good
patrickwe'll take 20
what the fuck kind of laptop are you getting for 3k?
WHY?
I really think it's a beautiful machine..And i bulit it myself with like a saw and a hammer and shit!
a goddamn good one that'll last 8-10 years.
it's a pretty solid plan, not my first time doing it.
You know heated air goes up, right.Why do you hang it near the ceiling then.Are you an actual sandnigger.
alright, appreciate the advice anon
Free cases are ideal

cm850 trash tier psu you wont make it sorry
some1 explain how mining works, y would it fry a pc wtf?
sureAwww that's even more ghetto than mine!what model cards?i didn't hang it and it's nowhere near the ceiling, it's balanced on my stereo, supported (if tumbles) on the left with a speaker and a medicine jar and it's fixed to the desk with a metal chain on the right, look in this last piture4294641cS850Mno good?was 650 shekels!
x RX 570 on a z270 prime pushed by a 1500 watt PSU
it just uses the graphics card on max power 24/7and you would want to overclock itand a laptop only has one cardand its a laptop= not good idea
NOICE
u rich asf op gl with mining
will there be new good GPUs for mining in the near future ?
1080ti and 1070 are both old should I invest?
portfolio is a sad 0.46 BTCis this much to you?
?VEGA by amd i thinkbut it costs a lot
4294609These are fucking atrocious, learn to use a fucking tape measure and saw, everything looks over sized or snapped off.
Then get an impact drive and some wood screw to hold this together properly instead of cable tiles and fuck off length screws hanging around.Triggers me hard.
Good.
I used a saw.
A fucking hand saw.
I measured by lying one stick on top of the long one and then cutting by hand.
I then drilled it all together and put little 90 degree brackets because fuck you.It's great.
That case has been functioning for months and right now is supporting up-time of over 700 hours.
trust me, it's very solid, no jiggling, shaking or wobbling of any kind, it really is a beautiful, solid built, cheap, effective, high tech futuristic money machine that i built with scraps of wood from my shed.it's still trippy to have it in my room
r8 mine, /biz/
6x vega 64 7x 4707x 5707x 1070All on cryptonight making a total of 23000 sols and taking 3.6kw off the wall
I used to sit on it
ooh neat!
what wattage psu?
why not add more cards?Holy hell tip btc for a poorfag trapped in the mines?1CxNwEeYDN9mVRL4wvBrLHb6qPagtdZiLF
4294895good designsaved and I am going to copy thisthanks

I met Vitalic Buterin and i didn't tell him i mine eth
That's a 775W HP server PSU that I got for ~$25 and I'm limited by this.
Cards are R9 290X, they consume a lot(260-280W under full load I guess), but their "used" price and $0.06 per KWt make it acceptable.And I'm using an old uATX motherboard that has only 3 PCI-E slots on it.
But I bought it for $25 along with the CPU, so again it's>acceptable(I managed to get a PCI-E splitter to work so now I am seeking another cheap 290X locally)
which is great if you pay for electricityAnd are bad if you don't ?
Why would you ever spend 3k on a laptop?Just buy a cheap rig with two or three 1070s and you'll have like 5 times the hashrate with 3/4ths the chance of burning your chips.
How much per month do you net on a setup like that and which coins do you mine?
SOL/watt isn't a measure that matters if you have free electricity.You would measure SOL/card cost
ETHabout-160-210 usd per monthsometimes ZEC
just buy 300$ ones that last 5 years each
Normies in crypto worry me...
42937814294609You're an idiot savant - I can tell cause your framing is absolute garbage
Uuuhwe mine whatever gives us the most crypto tard
what exactly are you using as non-conductive material to mount the motherboard?
