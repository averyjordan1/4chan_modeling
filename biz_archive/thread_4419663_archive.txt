I invested in ARK when it was 0.00046 BTC, how fucked am I?
Did KP's voice actress ever do anything else after it ended?
if you think youre fucked always remember theres some dude that bought at 120k sats
Nah my nigga u good, we goin for 200k in january
"Your words in the Spaghetti Monsters ear" as they say.
I bought at the very bottom op, you're just not good enough as me
it was at 25k about a week ago
never hit 25k, almost but no.
I was bust making 200% gains on nuls at that time =)
On the other Hand I didn't buy 178 ARK but almost 4k.
so who cares thats a nice stack of ark either sell low now or just stake it and forget about it
Let's say that in 2 weeks Bitcoin corrects downwards a grand or two and Ark's sat price rises, as seems to be the trend with Ark and alts generally.Pre-correction, I buy $500 of BTC but it's so much more expensive that I get way fewer sats.
Even though Ark's sat price is low, I have fewer sats to spend.Post-correction, I buy $500 of BTC and get more sats, since the BTC price is low.
Ark's sat price is higher, but I have more sats to spend.Wouldn't it more or less equal out?
never hit 25kanon it was like 25.2k
;)
REEEEEEEEEEE h-heh you sold it already of course early on r-right?
