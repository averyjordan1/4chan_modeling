If you have half a Bitcoin, you can get maybe 3 or more BCH which is the original Bitcoin (without segwit, without centralization).I think in the future the ratio will be 1:2, 1 BTC for 2 BCH, but it's really cheap now as it's only 3 months old and a lot of people that got in were FOMO holders who don't see the future potential.
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE RISKS I JUST WANT BITCOIN
