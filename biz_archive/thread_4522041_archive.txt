btc shorting anon here again.
I opened short position on btc this night, now doubled it.
expecting btc sub7k, probs will short more
BTC just bounced off channel top, going straight to the bottom.
Another factor is ETH on the rise to $500, btc money flows there now.Don't cry like a little babies afterwards.
I warned you once and doing it again now.
I've made 13k on ETH today, my body is ready.
You're braver than me since i only sold, but this does seems like a no-brainer.
Yes, it does.
Ppl around here better realise this simplefact, else they'll just have to blame themselves when downfall comes.
How do you draw those channels?
Like, what are your reference points and why?
