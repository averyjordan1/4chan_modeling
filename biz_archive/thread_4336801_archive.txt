Hey guys, i thought of programming a Crypto roulette, what do you think of that idea?You create an accounr deposit eth btc whatever and can play roulette with an nice overlay.There are already websites taht offer that, but i think they are too complicated for some people and dont look nice i guess.What does biz think of that?
I gamble sometimes, its netted me more than margin trading ever has lmao.
When im just bored i sen like 10 or 20 bucks worth of monero or some other coin to a site.
They problem is, getting the starting bankroll.
the site i use has an "investing" option where they pay you 70% of the profits the site makes depending on how much you have "invested".
Good idea.
FunFair is about to change this space dramatically.
Might want to look into it and see if you can build on their platform instead of reinventing the wheel.
sounds good, accept feenix tokens too
good idea just hope you have a sound understanding of cyber security / building secure applications when your messing around with peoples money
