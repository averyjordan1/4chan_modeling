> holding bags of Ark, WTC and OMG for months> portfolio value in satoshis keeps decreasing every day> bagholder even tho the projects are promisingwhat do i do, /biz/?
Do I sell these fucking shitcoins and ride the BTC wave?
I'm on the same boat dude.Honestly I feel like it's pointless to sell alts now, time to sell for BTC was weeks ago if not a month.. Do you really see btc hitting 16k before end of the year?
Where as ARK doubling to $6 is a hell of a lot more likely.You've already suffered through the worse at this stage.

Same boat anon, when will it be our turn?
I hear ya, I'll keep holding these.
Just hurts to see BTC moon and my other investments lag behind.
Hope it's sooner rather than later.
Fking Ark... and WTC is just chilling there
I am stuck in the same problem, but I'll just hold on to my alts and stop thinking about the BTC value.
As long as I'm making profit in US dollar value, I won't complain.
btw, that's one ugly ass bitch right there
>been holding RLC>down $700>see news about POWR>fuckit, sell RLC at a huge loss, pour everything into POWR>Make back that $700 and earn another $700 in 2 days.>Sell it all back into ETHAlts are a wild ride.
kys pajeet fucking shit
same here....i keep thinking it's pointless to sell at this point, but i've been saying that for like almost 2 months now, lol.70% of my portfolio is WTC and LINK, fun times.
The shitty part is that I held POWR for a bit too but then sold thinking it was another sheetcoin.
Oh boy was I wrong TT
Why wouldnt you keep holding your Ark?
Of those 3 its the only legitimate token with a usage... Sell your OMG and WTC.
3-6 tokens should take up 80% of your overall portfolio.
10% I put towards riskier tokens.
The other 10% I put into ICO's.
Omanilla atm.
