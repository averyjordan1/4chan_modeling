Yea gook speak is real helpful
when you run it through google translate it talks about a "one belt one road" thing, whatever the fuck that is.InChain own's Nuls by the way.
CHINGCHONG PLINGPLONG NIHAOremember to get 10k so you can run a juicy masternode

>director of the Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury BureauNo direct reference to InChain/Nuls, but yes if there is anyone up for this, the prime and most ready for this sort of use candidate this is InChain.
BETTER THAN ETH AND NEO.
DON'T SHILL THIS COIN TO PAJEET'S.
WAIT TILL THEY SEE THE YELLOW PAPER AND CRY!
InChain technology joins the Elephant Alliance to jointly implement the "New Global Trade Rules"http://btcif.com/?p=255294...When I think of it, they already have a foothold in the trading import/export largest alliance in ChinaSo their position is close.
Definitely closer than Neo or any other Asian project that I know of.IF blockchain tech becomes part of One Belt One road, InChain is already positioned and technology developed for this use case.Chances of being picked way more than 50%
