wtf why is this going back up?
Can someone tell me if it's too late to claim BTG?
I had my bitcoin in an exodus wallet in october.
Is there an exchange I can move it to to get it like there was with bitcoin cash?
How do I get my BTG from Bittrex?!?!
They said they'd be given us our shitcoins.REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
You need to export your keys if exodus doesn't support BTG.
Then sweep it into coinomi and send to Bittrex.
Whoa, nevermind.
It has been live for hours.
REEEEEEEEEEE!
