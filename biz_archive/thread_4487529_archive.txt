should I be worried?I bought at 1700 and it is struggling to get back upI guess this makes me a submarine
It went down when BTC pumped to $8300, wait for btc to stablize again and it'll come up
it goes up and down like this, sell back at 1700 if you can't wait for their December release it won't grow much until then
how big will december be?I heard the public beta will go liveI guess holding would be a nice stress free two weeks unlike trying to juggling coins chasing pumps
It means substratum will have a product at least and not vapourware.
Its a product release meaning it will gain traction and people will fomo into it likely due to the low marketcap and a hidden gem this is.
please don't hype this into the next chainlink
Yea I guess I'm being too impatient.I am also hearing rumors of Bittrex listing.Big if true
What I'm always worried about is bad news like delays and devs tweeting something along the lines of of we've got a problem and this needs fixing.
This always always makes a coin tank in value 5 seconds after the tweet.
