Soooooo, I found an exploit on a gambling site.
It's hard to do manually but I'm sure somebody could code a bot that could do it with much better results..
I call bs for the time being.Elaborate on this exploit.What site?
Csgo?
Fantastic, OP.
Thanks for sharing.
no larping I have experience writing casino bots, I used to exploit signup bonuses that were +EV and had bots do the gameplaytell me more about your exploit
to elaborate yes I wrote the bots.
java backend for video poker/blackjack etc.
gameplay decisions, auto-it for controlling mouseclick/keyboard events
I mention because I'm curious if anybody wants to get in on it.
If I can find someone I trust can create the bot they'll be the only other person to know.
Then if both of us are in agreement we share or keep it to ourself.
Guess all you want, only thing I'm willing to say is it is btc gambling :)
KYS faggot.
Sounds interesting...
Explain moar!
I'll let you suck my dick for free
I found an exploit on a gambling site years ago.
Before i could do anything to profit they updated their tos.
It's a simple mouse click.
But it has to be able to recognize if the current bet was won or lost.
I'm able to react to it quick enough to have about 15% success rate.
Due to lag timing is tough.
Dice?
Crash?
