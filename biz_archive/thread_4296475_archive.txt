Bitcoin cash IS the real bitcoin.Corecuck development team is now openly talking about (((rewriting))) the whitepaper.
Off-chain transactions defeat the whole purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies as we will instead be dependent on these centralized off-chain services.
This is a much bigger threat than mining centralization.Buying BCH today is like buying bitcoin core 1 year ago, get in while it's still on sale
I'm all for the flippening and I'm deep in BCH and I know it's happening, but this is really retarded.
Let's not pretend any POW coin has a chance of being well decentralized, let alone ASIC POW coins like BTC and BCH.
They will all be run an oligarchy of mining farm owners and mining pool runners.Yes, BTC is more garbo than BCH, but not for "muh decentralization" reasons.
That dream existing with proof of work is dead.
Shilling that line you're shilling right now works against BCH because even though the average "crypto trader" is plenty retarded, there are limits to how retarded, and the hypocrisy of this argument exceeds that limit.
bch cannot be stopped

Excuse me sir have you heard of our lord and savior Bitcoin Cash?
It follows in Satoshi's teachings
Off-chain transactions defeat the whole purpose of decentralized cryptocurrencies as we will instead be dependent on these centralized off-chain servicesThere's no reason for off-chain transactions to be centralized, in fact LN adds another layer of descentralization Upping the block size and centralizing nodes is centralization
