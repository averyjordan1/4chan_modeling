Why canâ€™t I just pay with literally any other coin lmao??
find one that offers it and has the support of the porn industry, and models ready to earn money on cam with 45% LESS fees
how does the blockchain make anything cheaper?
only benefit i could see is making anonymous payments
This coin could have been great except it's so poorly thought out.>Proof of spankThats kinda funny, but pretty stupid.
banks not raping
why pay...when we can get it for free
idk man i really dont see a future where we have a crypto currency for every fucking industry out thereit would be far too annoying to manage your 100 walletsi just dont see it
true, but the porn industry makes money regardless
thats the thing, with ether you dont need 100 wallets just one, plus the models will accept any token, but need to convert it to spank
You have no idea how many lonely doomed beta cucks are out there.They're willing to pay $$ to jerk off to whores on cam that give them attention, something to fill in their own void.
its different when youre actually interacting with the person and ask for specific things to be done......that nut is A+
