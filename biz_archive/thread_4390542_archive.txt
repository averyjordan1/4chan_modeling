This coin REFUSES to stay down.
Holy shit this is the comfiest hold ever.
People are accumulating mainly because the mobile wallets are going to be out soon.
For once I actually bought the dip.
Got in 3k ark at 43k, getting gains staking, and the value keeps going up in spite of BTC.
Def the best hold right now
Is staking the way to profit off of Ark?
I have 800 and I dont want to stake or mine, just sell them off at a profit, what do you think?
well if your just holding it for the time being it doesnt hurt to stake it.
it costs one ark and u'll b getting about 1.5 ark back every week
But I really dont want to keep my computer going all day, that's prety much why I dont stake any coin.
I used to just daytrade but since I started uni I've been looking for better investments mid-long term, is Ark not that?
Best thing about ARK is you don't have to keep your computer on to stake.
Just vote and collect
It was 11k at some point.
You don't have to keep your computer on.
Delegates do the "mining" and you get your share from the delegate.
As long as they are top 51.
Different delegates have different payouts.
http://calculator.reconnico.com/Although most will say biz_classic is best payout.
Them or Jarunik.
To my noob eyes the long term graph looks pretty promising, should I hodl?
4391445Thanks guys, I really should read up more on coins I'm invested in (or maybe before I invest in them...)Will check it out!
Jarunik is being a Jew and dropped his pay percentage to 80%.
There's a big fuss over it on /r/ArkDelegates
Welp, bought at .00044 and it instantly plummeted.
EVERY TIME.
Guess I'm going long.
Want vote for jarunik or some other high paying delegate, but need 1 Ark to do so.
So help me out right?

peasant, you are not even an arklet, you are just another sinner.
