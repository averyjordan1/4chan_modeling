The devs have been honeydicking us about a partnership with a top tech company.
They are in talks with a huge company but aren't saying who it is or when the announcement will come out.
I don't know if I should buy on this or just wait it out.
I don't like iExec, shit name and shit logo.
I don't trust it, been looking at it for awhile.
Huhu what's she doing with those bellows?
Is she gonna pump air in her butt?
I love the name, reminds me of .exe and also i enjoy the black and yellow thing
This is the most undervalued project.
It is going up on partnership rumors.
Get in anon
>partnershipsah, so it's a scam
never trust baguette fag with anything other than food
Some info from their slack:They gonna have a meeting with IBM representative in the upcoming weeks, it wasn't planned, a rep approached them (!!!)
to talk about cloud computing on some conference.They gonna have an partnership announcement, not related to IBM, and they hired a PR firm to do this.Could be nothing, but there surely will be some pump.
I have comfy 20k RLC lying around.
I'll just wait.
This thing never significantly dropped.
The entry point is okay at the moment.
When this takes off, this will outshine Golem and the rally will be even bigger.
