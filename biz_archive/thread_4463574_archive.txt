Why is nobody talking about the fact Neo is about to tank??
Idiots bought thinking that for some reason the Chinese Government would grant some sort of exclusivity to their platform.
WTF?
When in fact, the BIG NEWS is just a competition!!
https://neo.org/competition.html
this is fud, big news related to microsoft
If the competition was the real news it would have tanked hours ago.
Also they confirmed this news will have nothing to do with China and regulations so no one is expecting this anymore.
Microsoft assisting in delivering the 'competition'.
They have done that for thousands of organisations.
It is not a 'partnership'.
It's nothing
all these dump neo shill threads
No they didn't!
They have confirmed nothing except the conversation which said it wasn't government was a fake Photoshopped conversation.

thing is NEO is a shitcoin i'm willing to go full blown marine on, it needs a lot less than similar capped coins to go fucking ballistic, at odds mind you, but better odds as it needs to actually deliver nothing to do it
Yes they did.
They said there was nothing about the government or regulation and any news like that would come from the government.
