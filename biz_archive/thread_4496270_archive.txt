Tell me why its mooning please
It's been oversold forever.
This is one of the most solid and currently undervalued projects in crypto, it's only natural that it starts climbing out of the hole it has found itself in.
I agree.
Shit ton of talent in this project.
But this spike is shenanigans.
Let it come to rest and get a stake and sit on it.
