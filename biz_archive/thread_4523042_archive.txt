Bancor up 12%!!!!
because eth is up 12% and bancor's value is pegged to eth, but it's still down in eth value over 24 hours.
Why are you still bagholding this shitcoin, it's not going anywhere, just cut your loses and move on.
This is literally the most retarded investment of all, even shitcoins like POSW could moon one day in a p&d way, but this shitcoin will only depreciate in eth value.
Better just dump it for eth and hold it
