Where are my fellow Obsidian brothers?
After the messaging app, what would you like to see next on the platform?
Who else is comfy?
Hi friend
I'd like to see a marketplace built on the platform.
Besides that, I can't think of anything right now.
ODN is the reason why i stopped daytrading, i just hodl and buy more.
great times ahead.

Hey buddy.
Yes but WE were the ones pumping it you fucktard.
Now itâ€™s in a regular lifecycle.
What type of app would you like to see implemented on the platform after the messaging one?
Preferably one that can trade cheese pizza
I hope to see more security/anon based apps.
Heck even something like 4chan!
