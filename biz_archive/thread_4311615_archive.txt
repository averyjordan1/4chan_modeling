What's up I won on the lotto 3 months ago, I lived and won around 10 mill after taxes in Arkansa btw I'm 18 I won on my birthday.I've been researching how to become stupid wealthy and found 4chan help me out; I've moved out of my parents house and came to cali.
Basically I bought a lot of land for a mill, a rv, and building a house rn.
I don't want to go to much in detail and have someone hunt me down but I got a lambo and a BMW daily driver.
I bought a gold chain and pendant.
and a patek ice out of 120k I found 4chan Biz/ and doing my research just watching and reading.
I got like 90 btc.

Let's be friends.
West Tennessee bro here.
If real, my best advice is to contact crypto capital elite and let them manage your portfolio.
Oh.
Oops.
You don't live in Arkansas anymore.
Lul no shit there's a crypto capital?
Like a bank stock agent?
Would it be ran by computers or what?
If there's any pump gods that want to talk through encrypted email i'll pay big bucks?
or who knows how to mine coins, I'll buy the equipment.
I'm Building my house bc it will be worth hella more than what I payed for the land and the building.
I'm building a 5k sq feet house and the lot of land is small but worth around a mill.
I can sell that for like 25 mill and go full in mining

Invest in property.
Gods not making any more land.
If you get rental properties or even nice places you can airbnb then just go when you want and don't list it.
You can have passive income and still live a lavish lifestyle you want.
Hire an accountant.
Most lottery winners end up broke.
Don't be like those idiots.

1HP1JyqXxsu5ZhatVq8WPk4RK8iNTmwQ7KWhat I think you should be doing is getting a fair bit eth, a fair bit of bch/btc and a fair bit of monero and just locking it away for a year or two.
I think you will get huge growth out of those.
I'm not sure what's best with btc/bch atm though with all the changes.
Tip me for a better life op gratz
Thisyou have more money than most people on this board.
Keep it in a safe investment and don't risk it on alt coins.
If anything buy some bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin.
All very safe and will yield a good return.
Don't look for moonshots
