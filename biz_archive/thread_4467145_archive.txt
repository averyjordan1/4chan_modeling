Uhhh, Solar coin has 38 million coins in circulation... and 98 BILLION total coins.
the price is mooning because there are literally no coins in circulation.
Power only has 1 billion and half the coins are already in circulation.I fucking bought into SLR instead of Powr because of PBC shills.

SLR looks like a total shit coin from all angles.

slr reminds me of the shit company called solar city.
was a company doing similar shit with solar panels and was on the verge of going bankrupt until elon musk had to buy them out.
solar panals are still too expensive to produce to invest in them.
takes 15-20 years to start seeing gains.
Nobody cares about these projects, we just want to ride the pump
The PBC coin is going to be DNT but go ahead and fud about until it's passed down to you.
when is the next issue released?
Today at 5 PM eastern time.
Usually it is on the website for subscribers between 4:55 and 5 PM.
SLR is a fork of litecoin nigga
those coins in storage only get released when people claim their solar generation.
meaning more people will use SLR = more adoption = more demand.
SLR aims to be a stable value coin representing the generation of 1MWh of energy.
They aim to stabilize the price @ $30.
meaning a non volatile asset, in the future all alt coins will be priced in SLR and not BTC.
5 - 10 years?
take it as you will.
