I'm not confused about numbers on page adding up or not, but thats a fuck load of BTC tht doesnt show on the order book chart.
Sorry, kind of a noob.
What am i missing?

So is this real or a glitch???

what you circled indicates that there are unfilled buy orders for bitcoin adding up to a total unit quantity of around 1.9 billion bitcoin, throughout the entire bid side of the order book
