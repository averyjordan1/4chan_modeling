>not wanting serious gainz riding it up and selling offstay poor
>He bought sub $500Still comfy gains.
I sold last night for BTC, feels good, this pump and dump is over
What do you mean?
it's still trading heavily, I've made gainz like never before
It was such an unnatural climb to 2k, obviously something sketchy with that rodger cuck moving all his bitcoins, wish I sold at 2k, but just wanna sell before it's sub 1k againwe will see what happens, but I'm confident in finally dumping my cuckcash
i lost so much money please god help me
I bought in at 0.08 So it has been comfy.I slept through when it was 0.4, but ever since I have been skipping between this and BTC and made alot of gainz
Dumped all of my BCH.
Lesson learned.
may kek bless us all

WHY THE FUCK WONT BCH RECOVER HOLLY FUCK MY MONEY
be bcore>take out patents on side chains like lightning network>artificially suppress block size and force the network over to segwit so you can implement patented side chains>all so bcore and blockstream can centralize and control the network>"satoshi's vision"If you buy BTC, you are being manipulated.the joke is on you though, I'm all in ETH and gave up on BTC last year when I saw the writing on the wall.
so enjoy your wild ride bitcoiner.
I don't doubt that at least some of the core developers are connected with lightning network projects.That still doesn't change the fact that handing the reins to Bitcoin's development over to chinese mining interests (which are already too powerful) would be nothing less than slow death for the platform.LN at least provides a plausible path forward for Bitcoin scaling, with a lot of potentially compelling features.
The only "solutions" we'll ever see from the BCH crowd are those that put more money in bitmain's pocket.
Buying into a parabolicbruh...
I agree with you anon.
I wouldn't trust the chinks taking my trash out to the curb.
that's why I switched over to using ETH instead of bitcoin.
until core or someone else can think of a solution that all parties can agree on, bitcoin is just not a safe investment.
all parties can agree onThis is where I start to get nervous.
To the extent that Bitcoin has been successful -- if to the extent that success will continue in the future -- I think it owes that success to its design as a decentralized, trustless system in which nobody necessarily agrees on anything.There are clearly some problems with miner centralization, but as long as their efforts at outright subversion (i.e., BCH) continue to be BTFO, I think the ecosystem just gets stronger.I suppose we shall see.
Bitcoin cash lol!!!!
What a joke currency, you should sell it all right now.
Sell all of it, cut your bags.
Do it, do it now.
No kidding, it's taking off
