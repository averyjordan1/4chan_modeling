mfw some people are still hodling bch
Did you know that there are actually way fewer BCH than BTC?
Its true, its because all of the bitcoin that was already burnt before the fork stays burnt on the bitcoin cash chain.
Additionally a lot of bitcoin cash was burn at the time of the fork and since with people sending their bitcoins out of the addresses unaware of the BCH, thus burning it.In essence the market cap may be significantly lower, but it does explain the rising price, there is a constricted supply.
