If the 2014 Bitcoin bear market was caused by Mt.
Gox, then why did all other cryptos also suffer the same bear market?The answer is simple, Bitcoin's last enormous crash wasn't caused by Mt.
Gox.
That was just a symptom.
It was caused by a technical overvaluation.
Bitcoin, and the whole crypto market are currently topping out their current bubble cycle.Anybody hoping to "get in" at this point will be destroyed over the next year.
Nothing ever changes.
BTC SegWit surely isnâ€™t worth 7k7
