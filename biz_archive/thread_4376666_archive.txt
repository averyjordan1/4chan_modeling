Would I make more money taking out my bitcoin profits @ $7,300 and reinvesting when it dips again to $5700 or by hodling and being greedy?
>daytrading bitcoin
Spawn of satan... Use your fucking brain.
It'll hit 8k before next drop.Take profits then and buy back later
This, invest in altcoins in the meantime then sell them as they go up to buy bitcoin in the rebound
I don't think you should swing around with Bitcoin considering it's the most unpredictable coin in the marketYou can do that almost infinitely with Ethereum and Litecoin though, very stable coins
sell all btc and rebuy in 2 monthsits a smart move.
