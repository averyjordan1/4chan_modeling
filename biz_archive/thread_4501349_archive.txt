Remember when we used to share promising ICO's?
Remember when this board wasnt filled with pajeets?Omanilla is in pre-ico right now, theyve developed apps for all major mobile operatings systems and beta-tested already.
Apps go live by EOY.
Unlike others, they are targeting disconnected markets to bring new flow of money in.They also have a prototype of a dedicated device, live demo in March I believe.
K now yours.
ICOs are fucking done
This LINK was like the last good one.
It's much safer to buy the likely dip after an ICOSo glad I dodged Airswap and Request.
I wasn't so lucky with EBET and ENJ AHHHHHHHH (although EBET is making a breakthrough?
shit volume though so probably doesn't count) I guess presale is another matter.
I know what you mean, you have to sift through 90% pajeet shit to find a legitimate product.They exist, kind of hoping people share em and why.
No pajeet posts or get called out.
SCAMThis ICO is a scam.No team and the whitepaper is just the Bitcoin whitepaper.
WaBi was a great one.
Actual working product being sold.
Too late to get in now though, whitelist closed.
COB Only thing making me money however I still bought it on PajeetDelta whilst an ICO was still running for cheaper (idk what the deal was with that).
The team looks competent and they are Taiwanese so I trust them more than slavs and mainland chinese.
Also they got some hype from the whole "we will list the shitcoin you vote for the most for free" They know how to get attention.
Now might not be the time to buy though, it's at an ATH today
Buying from ED was cheaper I meant
This.
I don't even mind though.
Wabi>Devery >Jibrel >ZilliqaYou're welcome.
Holy shit whats with these fuckin Ugandi names for tokens.
A small Japanese village is doing an ICO to save their town.
That's what I want.
A nice comfy ICO to relax in.
buying a coin that's named after the shittiest capital city ever
