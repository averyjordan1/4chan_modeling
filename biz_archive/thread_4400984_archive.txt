Do I need to sign up to different Exchanges, or can I just get Blockfolio and do everything from there?
Total noob here.
No.You can trade with Blockfolio.
So, do people have Blockfolio on their phone, then use another service on computer, and this takes care of everything?Also, if I get spooked by cryptocoins and want to temporarily step out while the price plummets, can I immediately sell whatever cyptos for FIAT, then buy back cryptos when I want (keeping it all in the system)?
I think I saw Bitfinex offering something like this.
