AHHHHH $40 MILLION OF ICONOMI'S ASSETS WERE BURNED IN THE ETH HACK.
https://etherscan.io/address/0x376c3E5547C68bC26240d8dcc6729fff665A4448HOW IS THIS TRADING AT $1 STILL.
I don't get it either.
There was a similar thread already.
Basically: don't buy this scam.
Legions of bagholders waiting to dump on you.
Nobody is selling anymore because it already lost like 6 times of its ATH.
This can never even think about recovering again.
this is my heaviest bag for sure.
Luckily I don't have that much of it.
It'd be pointless to sell it right now.
if iconomi actually worked it would have been the best easymode crypto investment
I was one of the first 100 investors in the project.
Really had a lot of promise but the legal issues behind ICN caused them to change the token and business model.
Sold that shit somewhere between 3.50 to 4 cant remember.
I think ATH was $5+?
heaviest bag> donâ€™t have much of itMake up your fucking mind faggot
The token is worthless, the platform is the best crypto hedge fund.When will you faggots realize that most tokens are absolutely positively completely worth/useless?Everyday somebody acts surprised by this, blows my mind.
Make up your fucking mind faggotI can see why that's confusing.
Sorry.
It's the biggest loser that I hold.
I have lost ~70% of ICN value since I bought it.
ICN is less than 1% of my portfolio overall.
ICONOMI is the worst company out there, avoid it at all cause
And I just sold $25k USD worth of ICN finally, not holding anymore, I dont care if it goes x10000 now
