I come to you for help.
I will be busy all day but I'd like to make Satoshis.
What coin should I hold for the next 12 hours?
ETH
Comfydo CFD and Horizon State (HST)
Monero
AE
Lisk will rise 8-10% the next 8-12 hours.
HST, REQ, LINKcurrently too comfy
Definitely CFD, should be hitting a new exchange soon
DOVU, ETH, BTC, LTC, DASH, XMR, ZCASH, ETP, BNB, EOS, IOTAare all tier 1 comfy
ARK, NEO, XMR, XRP is a jewcoin but it’s usually pretty stable.
During the btc/bch bullshit of this weekend I moved the majority of my btc into xrp and xmr since I honestly wasn’t sure what the fuck was going to happen.
May have missed out on some gains but I didn’t lose anything.
HST CFDREQ MODin that order
BCH if you want to quadruple your sats
BATdownward trend has flipped :)
NLC2, ZAPteh comfiest
Confido and its not close
