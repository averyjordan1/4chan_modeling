Daily reminder - The IOTA foundation is holding onto 20,000 user wallet address balances, and has been for over a month now.They were supposed to release everyone's funds today finally, but instead delayed the release again to "days to weeks in the future".If you invest in IOTA, this can happen to you.
Did you make that image?
How long did it take you?
No.
It's a screenshot from a Medium post.Many people think IOTA is problematic, for reasons such as them being able to freeze user funds, or modify any wallet balance between snapshots.
lol, IOTA is getting so much FUD for being a non-blockchain
This is not FUD, it's a legitimate issue that has been ongoing.
Many people are affected.
