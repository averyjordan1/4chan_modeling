my crypto portfolio is high risk, goes up and down 50% in a day sometimes but my stocks go up 10% per year consistently.
If crypto has a major correction I won't be out of the game.
3900USD, all in a bank account, 0 in stocks.
I have about 30 grand worth of inventory for items that i resell, takes about 2 years to get 15 grand worth of profit, it's very low effort though, autopilot basically except for clicking a few dozen buttons every week.,000,000USD>by 2023>want to buy properties to rent, delegate managerial decisions to someone for a fee, and then live off of passive income.
good luck anon, nice to see someone with a plan that isn't 100% crypto.
I always plan to try automation on business someday from reading tim ferris.
investor visa where?us investor visas cost 500k
gl bruhall you need is a coin with 20,000x ROIEZ PZ
Korea, investor immigration real estate scheme in yeosu or jeju, or just business visa and start a company there if I'm short a bit.
If I make it really big like 2 000 000, probably HK or SG.
