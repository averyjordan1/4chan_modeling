Leaf here.
Too late to get into weed stocks?
i would wait for a dip desu
do you hold any?
I'm curious what type of weed stocks are the safest.
I was leaning towards manufacturer becasue they'll be used no matter the implementation of regulation province to province.
Just buy HMMJ etf.Dollar cost average.
Buy like $500 every pay check.This sector will only grow in the next decade.
I am unemployed.
I do have 10k I made from crypto though.
I guess that doesn't change much.
Ill have to consider this ETF.Thank you
no i was waiting for a dip since last nov and missed it because i got caught up in crypto bullshit.
hopefully there is one more before legalization
legalizationCan only smoke in your house in Ontario.Safe legal limits to drive require a month of abstinence.If you have kids underage ur pretty much fucked.>legal

Fudlook at the roadmap and say that again mate.
