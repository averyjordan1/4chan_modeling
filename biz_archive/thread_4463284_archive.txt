IPY https://infinitypay.org/ .
This is a MTL-like coin with only around $300k market cap.
CMC listing next month as well as new exchanges.
Only 8,000,000 supply.
This could be the next 10x coin.
DYOR as always.
Are you really saying this could be the next exit-scam or what?
Dumbass.
is THIS the next CFD?LMAO
This is piece of shit is so generic that its almost guaranteed to be a scam.
It's gone 2x since this post.
Scam or no scam I'm still making money.
Are you?
Confido is actually the same group of people making a lot of the same type of token (escrow payment).The people behind marketpay.io and Payfair are the same ones behind Confido.
It's actually a pretty damn slick rinse and repeat.
They set super low market caps to people buy in, and dump before closing the project.
If you can time it right, it's easy money.
Otherwise you'll get burned.
Key is to not be greedy with it.
I'm just about ready to pull out of IPY already.
dumb pajeet u do know that comparing another shitcoin to CFD is not a good thing anymoreor did they not teach u that a scam schoolfilthy curryniggers
