Nah bro I think my vision is deeper.In the future people's pain impulses are going to be digitized and then transferred into the blockchain.
It's simple because our neural impulses are basically just electrical messages.Pain miners will get paid to experience the pain of rich people for them.
The same goes for farting.
Women and rich folk never need to fart anymore.
Fart miners or "fart slaves" will do the work for some Fartcoin.
What
LSD is still illegal in 2025, god damnit.
Too deep 4 u.
No you just get all your scripts on Silk Road now

I assume Modum monitors the packages to make sure they don't suffer any damaging effects from the fluctuating temperatures?
Yeah in light of recent events I might have to remove that line.
Don't let the thread die.

Thank you very much to whoever just tipped me a LTC!
Decent content is too rare on this board these days
When I got on earlier all I saw was half the board choked with post-your-address threads.
Shits fucking boring.
Glad I could do my bit to make the board that little bit less shitty.
