Doesn't reset a month of bleeding at the hands of Bitcoin.Not sure about you guys, but i fell for some "weak hands" and hodl meme bull shit at the beginning of the alt bleed.
I still have alerts on blockfolio for OMG to go back over 270k.
20% gains are great in a day, but it's like everyone forgot that the alts were getting pummeled by 10% a DAY for the last while.
Also, couldn't buy much on the dips because I was out of money, before that is pointed out.
Moved some alts to BTC way too late, personally.
Moved some alts to BTC way too late, personally.Meaning you sold low?
Being this impatient = stay poor.
Frankly I agree with you OPBitcoin is going to go on a rampage
