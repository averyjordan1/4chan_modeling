What are some coins that are still profitable to mine in this year of 2017?
Bitcoin
Pretty much all of them, as long as you have a reasonable electricity provider.
If you don’t want to buy an ASIC, go with XMR, ETH, ZEC, …If you want to go full-noob, use nicehash.
Otherwise dyor and mine what you believe in, on a pool that you believe in.
barrier to entry is like 100,000k or more probablyi wouldn't mine bitcoin even if I had the moneyI was thinking what coins are the most profitable to mine, specifically for a high end PC with a decent GUI - no ASIC hardware
use whattomine.com and you can tell it what you have and it will tell you what to mine.
Just use winminer.com or something and it mines for you
Thanks for the hot tip brotha
