A complete circuit-breaker hard cap will prevent trading after price swings of over 20%, up or down, on any given day.Uhh what the fuck does this mean for the price of BTC in the future?
Uhh what the fuck does this mean for the price of BTC in the future?Nothing, they're cash-settled, meaning they have 0 effect on the actual price of bitcoin.
if it goes up 100% it will take 5 days.
I'm sure you'll survive that
Bump
Literally nothing
oh no these fucking jews
They think this gives them power over us
If the price moves beyond that threshold they'll just stop trading and the action on crypto exchanges will keep on going without them that's all.
