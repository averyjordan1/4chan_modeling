What is the best way to sell ERC20 for fiat if I am signed up to an exchange that does not support that ERC20 token specifically?
Using shapeshift to convert ERC20 to Ethereum then selling the Ethereum on the exchange?
If not Ethereum, then what else?
Bitcoin?What things should I watch for when converting one coin for another with the end goal of cashing out to fiat?
