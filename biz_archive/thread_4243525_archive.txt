>no gf since birth>recently baptized as new money>starting to fall in love with a hookerwhat i do biz?
shes 100% my type and shieet.
is this the path to financial ruin?
i only got relatively wealthy for a few months thanks to my inheritance money (early 20s).
its all so tiring
hooker% my typeyou dumb niggerdo you not understand what a hookers job entails before, during, or after sex?
i dont understand...
Nice larp.
Prenuptial.
If she truly trusts you and isn't out to jew you she will agree.
Anon means that it's a hooker's job to make herself appealing to her client, it's only natural you'd think she is the one.
That only probably means she's a good hooker.
i researched about prenups before because of marriage FUD and found out they are disregarded by courts during lawsuits.
also, i dont think i can handle the paper work, im already having a hard time adulting with how to pay the bills and shit now that my parents are gone.
ive never tried paying for bills before and other paperwork adults need.
oh i see.
but my attraction seems genuine or maybe because im inexperienced.
No shit it's genuine, it's a girl you pay to act the way you want a girl to be and one you can actually fuck.How fucking autistic are you?
but this is the first time i am able to express my feels.
when my dad was still alive i never got to express my feels to a girl.
if he only listened to me that he should have regular colonoscopy starting age 50 he would still be around.
It is not you who decides whether shes the one.
Its the girl who decides if (You)re the one.Just ask her if she feels the same about you.
Its not taboo for hookers or strippers to fall for one of their clients, but dont expect her to like you because you have money.
