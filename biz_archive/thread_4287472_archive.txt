Me trying to use Etherdelta
Yeah ether delta dosent even say the current price of the coin I'm trading.>need to check blockfolio for that
is there anything even worth buying on etherdelta?
ZCG is seeing action.
Is there an EtherDelta phishing website?I think I messed up the url, or used a shit wallet, or idk what, but I just got scammed 0.8 ETH worth of DRP.
Meta Mask warned me that I was trying to enter a phising website.
I was new to it and I remember I had it yesterday as well but it went away.
Today it didn't go away so I exported my wallet and retried it.Fucking dumb I know, but I want to know exactly where it went wrong.
Also, I could see where my tokens/ETH went to.
They are scammed for sure so there is nondoubt about that, still wondering what exactly went wrong.
Was it logging into EtherDelta?
Maybe messing up Adress and Private key the first time I tried to log in?What wallet do you guys use with EtherDelta?
This.
Etherdelta is a fucking goldmine, the layout is just there to filter out pajeets because they dont deserve to make money.
You're supposed tu use metamak, I installed the extesion and hit the logo on my browser but it does not invite me create an account.
The fuck?
No, its even worse than Yobit.
If its not Poloniex or Bittrex, or at the very least Kraken or Cryptopedia, maybe Yobit at the very worst, its a fucking scam and a meme.
