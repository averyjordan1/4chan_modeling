Poorfag reporting.
Looking back on august, I remember chasing some hourly gains like a faggot - and now the hindsight shows all I had to do is - hold?Maybe some experienced / daring traders knew to discipline themselves and use the meme lines to buy the dips but on one random chart pic related (many alts have similar chart / up and down pattern so it doesn't matter f its MCO or whatever else) shows...You only have to hold?
Is that it?
