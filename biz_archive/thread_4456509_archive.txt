ICO’s:>As you have noticed there will be multiple ICO’s accessible through COSS.io>Some with added features and bonuses and some with simply trading promos.Here are a short list of the upcoming ones:1: GATCOIN (LIVE) https://www.gatcoin.io (mainsale starts December 15th)2: Dropdeck (main sale November 21st) https://dropdeck.io/3: Lala world https://lalaworld.io/ 4: https://www.aditus.net/>For all of the above ICO’s there will be trading promo’s once they list on coss.io>The 50 top volume traders of each specific token will share a nice pool of the said token.
Estimated ICO value of the pools $30–50,000USD for each token.>For Dropdeck, LalaWorld and Aditus there will be an added 5% on top of all existing bonuses if bought through the coss.io platform.>On top of this we are also discussing with many many more upcoming ICO’s and we estimate that we could easily offer 4–6 ICO’s per month going forward.
>ONLY KYC approved coss users will be able to participate in the ICO’s through coss.io >And all tokens will be trad-able on coss.io from day one of release.>And, YES we will make the ICO site more visible :-) >This is only step one in the progress of offering validated ICO’s through the platform, and in the future we will also see more exclusive ICO’s offered ONLY through coss.ioWe will also work close with the upcoming ICO’s and target to make some of them committing to exclusive trading on coss.io for the first 30 days (at least)
