Taken from the whitepaper of Ankorus which is a project that wants to revolutionze exchanges connecting the stock market with the crypto world.
(don't wanna shill to much but its pretty cool, definitely worth checking out).
But here's the thing that I wanted to share taken from their whitepaper:''There are 42,400 dormant bitcoin addresses, each with a balance of 25 bitcoins or more.Total dormant bitcoins: 3,380,582.
''Fuck thats a lot of BTC... thats 20%!
of the circulating supply, since these BTC are effectively out of circulation it would mean the marketcap of BTC should be: 27.11billion$ less.
Making it: $108.46billion instead of the current $135.58billion.Quite some numbers huh?
