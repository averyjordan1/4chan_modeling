PoW will be dead soon.
Which coins are there to replace BTC and LTC?
ETH
PoS is retarded, literally just an inflation mechanism that reduces the security of your blockchain, which morons accept because "muh environment".
PoW works because it is hard to do work.
PoS does not work, because it is not hard to do nothing.
its been in front of your face the entire time
Grab an ODN masternode you little bitch.
Before it costs 10k
ETH
Work is for the poor.Buy 1000 ETH now and stake it all, rake in the fees and become Bourgeoisie.
Tezos looks to be the most promising PoS when it launches.
People are also hyping PoS for Ethereum but they have some major scalining issues to figure out first

Posw ironically best PoS coin when their tech is released
when it launchesTezos is a meme you brainlet, the team already took all your money and now they have no incentive to develop.
Enjoy your losses.
Not sure what they're even doing there, other projects have already done everything Tezos are promising.
There's plenty of governance coins, and at least one other coin pushing security in smart contracts that I know of.
