Learned about crypto recently and read that bitcoin cash would replace bitcoin so i bought it while it was going up at $2300 but it went down a lot.
im really scared that was all of my money and even in debt now to some sharks.
please can someone help im actually going to end it or they will
Tell all of your friends/family/coworkers that crypto is a Ponzi scheme and discourage them from investing
Lol
Ok ill let them know when im also saying goodbye to them.
Hope you own guns
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA thats what you get for being a BCASH faggot!
larping as a loser to try and FUD BCHanother one
Just end it pal, itâ€™s better on the other side.
This journey is going to be very painful and you need put an end to it before the suffering begins.
he actually bagholds BCash
The sweet release is probably better than bag holding bcash.
dont worry tonight you'll get your money back and make some more, relax
