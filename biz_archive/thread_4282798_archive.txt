Guys...
I bought this at the ICO and I'm down 60%...Should I sell at a 60% loss now and buy REQ or just hold it?Serious answers pls I am devastated.
I don't know what to do.Thanks.
LAtoken was never anything more than sophisticated veritaseum FUD.
Sell for what you can get and move on.
I guess I have to sell, but damn that hurts, 60%.Will I regret buying REQ?
pls respond
You'll regret pissing around and letting it moon while you're doubting yourself on this Mongolian throat singing image board.
getting rekt by a piece of shit to immediately buy another piece of shit, this is why you guys never make it.
start fucking reading and make your own conclusions retard
REQ doesn't look like a piece of shit to me.What do you recommend then.
some people never learn, I won't shill you anything this is my recent acquisition go investigate before you buy for fucks sake anon
