It seems that BTC is stable at $7k... That's still $2k higher than it was before the talk about the B2X fork.
I'd say there's a 70% chance that tomorrow BTC will crush all alts again.
I haven't touched my bitcoins in years.
I used to use a wallet called Multibit, but it is not supported anymore.
What program can I use to access my wallet again?
You cannot access at all?
