Whats the fastest way for me to deposit 2000 usd and buy salt with all of it?
buy btc or eth on coinbase, send it to bittrex, buy salt
btc or eth or coinbase I heard takes some days too.
and I can't buy either because the price may drop if it takes days
bitcoin ATM but get raped in fees, then trade BTC or localbitcoins
These sort of posts make me think Coss could actually be huge when they start their alt/fiat pairs
