I'm very much in love with this coin.
I wonder how long until it reaches 200.

Pretty crazy you say that, my friend.
I was just shitting on a street gazing into my phone and thinking about the very same thing.
You are Punjabi as well?
Are we on the same street?

Jump check, right now or I'll shoot.

I agree, we'll probably see a short dump around 190 back down to 160 or so, then a pump back up past 200 and beyond.Best to just hodl.
