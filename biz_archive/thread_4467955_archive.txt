BCH about to moon again
stop crying wolf and howling at the moon.
when it has a break out that exceeds .2 and stays above, then yes, the over exaggerated and over used claims of mooning can become a thought in the back of your mind.
but keep it there.
and if it miraculously exceeds .3 and you just can't contain yourself any longer, you may allow the thoughts of lunacy to become a possible reality.
but at that point there would be no use in telling anyone because we would have all bought in already.
I want it to moon just so I can pick up more BTC on sale
