G Star is South koreas biggest game expo, and it starts in about an hour, and runs for 3 days.
Last year they had 200000 attendees.Pic related will be showcasing there this year.
If you aren't holding some, you'll hate yourself by sunday.
what kind of games are they playing?
Starcraft?
Probably.
For the record though Gamecredits will probably be showing off their mobile mmo they've almost finished.
We know how Koreans love their shitty mmos.
Koreans and their starcraft lol.
I hope there is a livestream somewhere.
