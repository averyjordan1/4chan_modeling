Would love it if Binance backdated all my GAS earnings.
Sounds unlikely though!
Bittrex***
I follow this guy on twitter and he's always incredibly late to pumps or news.
I want this to be true as much as the next ANS holder but I wouln't listen to fuckin crypto kirby
This shit was taken from asian whales who the fuck knows where that faggot got it from
Neo RumorsBitcoin Cash is discussed too, replacing BTC in China which is great.ETH is discussed too, which is great because ETH is superior to NEO.
WHHAT HAS NEO FUCKING DONE?!?
!THERE ARE ALSO NO DECIMAL PLACES IN NEO WHILE ETHEREUM GOES UP TO 18 DECIMAL PLACES.WHAT THE FUCK.
HOW DO YOU BUY A $1 COFFEE WITH NEO?

I have no idea, WTF is gas?
explain to me faggot
neo has ICOs soon
gas is your reward for staking NEO
i can confirm the neo being the only token allowed for chinese icos, my group is certain that it will be added to bithumb because of its massive volume, we are expecting at the very least for it to touch 100$, best case scenerio 300$ (same as eth
Stop loss is set at 0.00479.Time to get comfy.
minus the mining part would this make NEO .1 BTC?
higher?
lol scam pnd rumors
priced in
POWERED UP FOR MORE
EVEN UP THE SCORE!!!
ETH has gas too, and staking is coming soon for ETH, and it's accepted in more exchanges.
Plus you're not Chinese
now begins the biggest crypto battle of all desu.
china vs everyone else
>Unironically taking advice from a twitter post which unironically uses emojis.
No it won't.
Other countries (mainly Japan) will pick up where China left off.
No one is leaving those profits on the table.
your moms priced inthe rumor is priced in, everyone in now is only in because they think it could happen.
once the news hits, and then becomes priced in, it will go up.
you cant say the chinese regulation is priced in already, because it isn't real yet.
You can only say the rumor is priced in, if it actually happens then the market will adjust accordingly.
I'm curious how they are going to mine a non-mineable coin like NEO
well then BCH will be the survivor and according to 6h, 1d, and 7d mining average, it is much more profitable to mine the decentralized BCH than centralized blockstream core BTCplus there is a stronger community behind BCH actually wanting to improve it.
BTC people only think about "OMG PRICeS OMG IT IS GOING UP OMG IT IS GOING DOWN'
Thats da big news
NEO gas is different.
It can be traded.
Please tell me you are posting anime ironically
unironically doesn't know what twitter looks like
good taste mate.
and yes its looking like the battle lines are being drawn for 2018. a year of battle between china and everyone else.

F-Fake news
4420536Is most of Japan supporting bitcoin or bitcoin cash?
I know they tend to be westaboos and dislike China so I would guess they'd be supporting bitcoin.
Japan love BTC, that why korean pump BCH
