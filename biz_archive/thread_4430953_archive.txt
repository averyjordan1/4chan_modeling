what went wrong?
It's calledaccumulation phase tmbasically everyone will forget about this for a year and then it will randomly pump
Does anyone think it can moon another time if it hits different exchanges like binance and bittrex ?
might see some action when they release the ios/webapp
coins don't moon immediately after coming out anymore, and if they do they'll eventually crash hard within a short time frame
I made like 10% off it and took the profits, that offset most of my losses from getting the fuck out of HST
I'm guessing it will pump around the time(s) they distribute dividends.
People like free money.
