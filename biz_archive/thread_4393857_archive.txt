Ripple SEALs reporting in.
HOLD THESE COINS AT ALL COST.
THEY WILL BE WORTH A LOT IN 2018.
TFW dropped my bags a week ago for XMR
I sold 2k for vtc three weeks ago... no regrets.
Selling the other half if there's no movement soon.
you done goof, ripple about to go $1...
I still have 2k, got my sell orders in... everyone said 0.50 to $1 at swell, it never got close.
I'm happy to make a little profit and invest in a lower supply coin.
Maybe I'll buy some back when it hits 0.17 again after this
Get ready to be marines holding large bags forever if you don't sell on the news.
It's being pumped, but the real whales that would make it moon don't buy in because they're actually smart.
Ripple is good tech, but the coins are unrelated.
i would suggest to you, read the last news
