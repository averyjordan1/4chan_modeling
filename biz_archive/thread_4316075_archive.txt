Another fucking prediction market coin , when will this end anon
I actually have a good idea for a market.
It would be mostly for research though, but some people might like it, and it could conceivably turn a profit.
Anyways, no, it wouldn't ICO, at least not how any of these prediction markets have.
Having your own coin in prediction markets is a liability.
It seriously fucks shit up.
