I just want to make it bros, what is the best way?
Thinking about going balls deep into ethereum, should I just stick with bitcoin?
Bitcoin looks like it’s about to take a shit
Stick with Bitcoin
go with eth.
it's on an uptick and btc is at its ath and I'd wait for some dippage before going too heavy into it.
though some will say "but if you said that when btc was at 6,000 you would look dumb now!"
and they would be right, which is the problem - it is all unpredictable.
i'd still recommend eth though.
If you want to make it you need to buy a low cap.
The returns will be much bigger.
Relatively speaking it seems like everything that isn’t bitcoin is low cap.
Is ethereum not?
Is there really no better way than sending out prayers on the hundred currencies that get posted here each day?
