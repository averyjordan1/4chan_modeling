Could this finally be the Dip That Was Due??
yes
what do i use instead of tether?
You cash out, my friend.
And go back in once it's dipped enough for you
oh... no can do.
tether it is.
don't people in the usa have to pay tax when they cash out every time
No taxes to pay on losses, which is what you have if you're buying high selling low :)
how do I cash out?
Yikes
People in the US have to pay tax on every trade regardless of cashing out for fiat.
Or they're supposed to anyway.
Only a tiny fraction are following the law.
US beats any country in tax evasion anyway, if you look at sales tax enforcement.
It's astounding.Burgerland aside, I now kinda want to move out of bitfinex and back to kraken nowNews still isn't out, most people don't know about the tether scam, I suppose dip is still ahead of us?
