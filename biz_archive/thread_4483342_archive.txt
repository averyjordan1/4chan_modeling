the usd is so close to collapsebuy gold and silver if you want to dump crypto
But Gold and Silver are generally terrible investments for profit.
They remain stable.
I would just keep your crypto and get one of those debit cards which allows you to spend it.
Yeah fuck gold and silver.
Crypto is the perfect asset.
You can funge the shit out of it and it makes laundering your money childsplay.
Makes buying houses and shit like that look retarded.
