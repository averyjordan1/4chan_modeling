Tile anon here.
I post occasionally.
I lay tiles in an upscale suburb.I thought I was living the dream, working about 30hrs a week labor and I'm on track for $80k this year.I now have a mild pinched nerve in my neck.
From the bending over and repetitive motion.
Shit is not fun.
And came to the conclusion that I HAVE to get out of the labor.I tried a couple times to hire people in the past (white people).
And they did not work out.
Either their work sucked, or their work was good but they left after a few weeks when they found a higher paying job.I'm looking to pick up a Mexican person, try them out for a few days, and then transition them to full time labor.
I'm gonna start them at $20/hr.
This will work right???
Any tips from other contractors???
