Coin burn happening in 4 days and it seems to have gotten dumped alot.
Is this the bottom?
im waiting for it to bottom out atm.
some "whale" put up a sell order on ED for 100 eth last night and everyone freaked out rofl
If bitcoin goes on a run then I think this wont be the bottom.
However, I think this coin is an attractive investment if you hold on to it until it hits an exchange or two.
It has a very low market cap and the coin burn will make the supply more attractive.
Shit is a scam.
No one is going to pay for blockchain torrents.
