Like literally any investment.IF running a business is so profitable, why does investment exist when people could just pay for it themselves?
stupidest "investment" ever, how do people fall for this
so you would have like 3.5 btc after a year for ~2k?am I reading this right?
Buy the miners yourself.
Get 2 antminer s7-LN's or one S7 and you'll still have them after the year is up, not to mention more hashpower than they're offering.
.35 btc per yearstill good investment ....
No, you would have 1 btc after 1033 days...2 years after the contract is up.
You get about a third of a bitcoin after a year IF the difficulty doesn't change and the price stays static.
Because they can sell 30% of a mining rig's capacity for more than the cost of the rig and then have the other 70% of its production capacity available at 0 cost basis..
dont do it, they are mining BCash, which isnt profitable at all
