Redpill me on scalping.
Is it guaranteed gains, or just luck?
I was scalping weed stocks today.
Made $30.If I held a bit longer, I would have made $300.
What's your time worth?
You have to find something with volume and volatility.
19 mins to make like 7 dollars in this example pic related.
Do it over and over.
2% gains per day on a small investment is a lot over a year or two.
Pay your market tuition.
Emotional babbies pay the most
