What the fuck these so called "leaked news" even mean?
Could some smart basement dweller clarify for me?

You already tried this 5 days ago.
Pajeet do you want Teeka to text you?
Who the fuck is Teeka in the first place?
Hahaha I am rolling.
You sucker.. a piece of advice.. just buy DNT
stop this im accumulating you fag
Already hodling 300k
It's kinda sad to watch biz take this pump and dump newsletter so seriously.
Some dude predicted two things right and started charging for his own private pnd group.
He buys a coin then tells his followers to buy it raking in a ton of money, quite a genius scam desu i respect his hustle.
Then congrats Bro!
does it foking matter its going to pump u retard.
already strapped in
Haha good fud to lower POWR so you can buy more xD
I can BET its not POWR
pep if this is u i love u tookorean if this is u eat a dick
The god of /biz/
S (Social Media): Waiting on marketplace adoptionHahahah, that's not what Social Media stands for.
It's the chart that social media gained traction, buzz started, etc.
A worthy effort, but futile
Teeka is running the biggest PnD group as far as I know.
Therefore it's actually smart to follow his "advice"He's personally a nobody without any experience or knowledge about crypto, but he made himself into a brand
i already own this.
is it the same group
Based on what?
Any news about this shitcoin?
WTF?
me too, 1st trade as well, only..I didnt sell!
HODL
no
