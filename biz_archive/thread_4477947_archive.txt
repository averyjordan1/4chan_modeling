I don't get paid till the end of the month.
We need to keep the price below 8k till I accumulate.
Thanks, I've been looking for this picture specifically to post this in a thread.
Almost word for word.
They don't realize how insignificant $30m is in this market.

 Have $30MM in "dollars" >> Leverage it 10x>> Make 10 tradescongrats there is $3 billion dollars in volume.
DELET

That's all nice until you realise they hid the transparency report when they found out, and said nothing about it until they came up with some patched up solution that doesn't actually fix the problem.
Leverage it 10xanon...where...just...do you know how leverage works?
You retards do know you can look up the volume of various coin pairs right?
Good luck using frozen funds to make trades
everything dips because of BTC>not buying into a major alt coin that'll regain valueYou missed out on free money.
I bought LTC and i'm already up in sats!
Great, so what you're saying is it's even easier to manipulate markets since you don't need as much money
That's not how it works you brainlet
manipulate markets with less than 5% of the volume.
wallstreet manipulates with less that 1%soooo theres that
