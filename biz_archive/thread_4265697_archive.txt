Has the time come?
2 cents from breaking ICO price!!!
And the volume on Binance is really picking up now.
Here we go boyos strap put the helmets on
is there news?
not yet, just a healthy rise i think.
Its gonna dump hard the moment it hits ICO or 1 cent above it.
Thats when im buying im ready to get those sweet airswaps im ready to buy 50k-70k depending on how much it drops
4265964I think they'll release news about the beta at or near ICO price, but I hope they don't so that I can buy even more during the dip.
We are still far from the ETH price, that will be the next thing i think
It'll be huge.
I can't believe how much strength it's been building during November.
Completely ignored all the BTC fud for the most part.
Yeah, beside the quick drop when hitting exchanges, it's been pretty stable.
But when the date for the beta will come soon we are getting there
What happened to this shit?
It was shilled a lot before the ico but it went quiet really fast.
Very soon.
Did you notice that they re-posted an old youtube video yesterday after segwit was cancelled?
It's like they were waiting for this mess to be over before releasing good news.
That's really clever marketing, but you can expect good stuff with their advisory board.Tanked after ICO during the BTC bullrun.
Bottomed out at 18 cents and has been on a steady rise since then.
Well shit, no wonder it went quiet.
If it has any foreseeable future then it should be a fun ride for all of you.
hope so, I'm just glad i didn't panic sell in oktober.
Just broke 0.29, 1 cent from ICO

no need to shill now guyslet's keep it quiet, and the product itself will do the FOMO part
