just a reminder for those who were interested that the Bloom (credit score protocol for blockICO is near and it's not too late to try to get on the whitelist.
i know this is annoying, but they have a community-growth (ie marketing) initiative now where they are giving away tokens, as well as increasing your position in line to make the cut-off for the ICO, by sharing a referral link.
mine is below, feel free to check it out (or ignore) and DYOR.
thanks!
