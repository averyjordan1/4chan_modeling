What is the household income you'd need, to have a family of three kids in three suburbs, while maintaining hobbies of your own, plus side investments & a family vacation once a year?
ochenta e ocho dólares americanos, señor
Three kids in three suburbs
Cost of living / taxes vary a lot by state, but in general I'd say if you have a household income of $100k you would be comfortable.
I'm the oldest of five kids and I'm from the suburbs of Phoenix, AZ.
We were comfortable (not rich, but comfortable) on roughly $130k a year (sometimes more, sometimes less).
Probably around 100-120k a year if you're not wasting money on frivolous stuff like going out to eat and none of your kids develop a chronic health condition like autism.... >t.
wants to get married but has no money, no savings and juvenile diabetes
Depends on a lot, but anywhere from $100k-$200k minimum
4345107I make dis.
It is never enough unless you want to he average
Probably like a million dollars a day
Me and my girl friend make roughly 135k total with one child .
If we wanted to we could probably find a small suburban home and raise 3 children .
It would be a little tight but definitely possible
