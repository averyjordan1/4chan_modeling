Finally found that screenshot that has been posted around.
It was in one of their updates.PBC delayed until Monday the 20th of November is confirmed.
To be more specific: It was from the update on 8th Nov if any subscribers want to check and further confirm this.
so pick change was also true then, not a solar coin now (you can dump powr and sol now)
So SLR and POWR are going to get fucked
This has nothing to do with the pick change that is unconfirmed.
This is a update from 8th Nov.
The pick change is still a complete rumour
but it'a was in "the same rumour" with pbc been delayed.
So if delay true, then coin change also true
TWENTYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!good to see you posting around here againhow are you?
