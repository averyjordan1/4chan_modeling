He's right
wtf I LOVE ponzi schemes now!
do you think satoshi still has access to his coins?
Nah, he sold them for a diet coke.
Satoshi is a team and of course they still have access.
They will sell when the evil overlords(jews) tries to overtake the planet and establish the biggets private army ever to clense the world for evil(jews)
How long do you think it will be until he decides to dump a bit?Even dumping 5% of his account would JUST all our accounts for at least a month
>incompetent people in charge of large corporationsGee, I wonder how come neoglobalism is turning into shit
he is not wrong though..
Those coins are lost forever.
They will never move from said wallet.
Either private keys are lost, computer went boom, or creator made them with the sole intention of getting the ball rolling so to speak.
IF heâ€™s even alive.
it sorta is
it is.
bitcoin and crypto is mostly a meme.
bizraelis are mostly just riding the wave
