Is it possible to predict market-wide movement?
I wrote a Python script that just averages the movement of Top 250 coins for the 24h and it's insane how yesterday the average was -3% and today it's +9%.
I wonder if there are markers that can predict this.
For example, a good marker this time was Bitcoin and BitcoinCash.
The uncertainty caused by BCH mooning brought everything down, but as soon as we saw a trend reversal with BTC going up and BCH going down, the alt market went back up, even more than Bitcoin did.
Any psychologists here care to explain the mentality behind this?
give python script
It just averages the 24h price action for each coin, it's not hard to do that lol.import requeststicker=requests.get('https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/?limit=500').json()changes=[]for coin in ticker: if coin["percent_change_24h"]!=None: changes.append(float(coin["percent_change_24h"]))print("Number of coins evaluated: " + str(len(changes)))print("The average of all 24h%chng is: " + str(sum(changes)/len(changes)))
you should try volume weighting it
Second one in from right, the others are dogs, especially that Jew on the right
2=14
Would give the leftmost a spin
Yeah, she's the least offensive of the others kek
4341461good taste.
she's the best one
 3 2 4
I'm learning python and it's starting to make sense after a few hours of learning.
is it really this easy?
my nigga
All except first one is not that good, but regardless I'd pay full price to get all of them.Talking about the top 250 coins ofc
1>>>>>>>> dogshit 3 not close
4341531I'd dump all of my NUT on them at the highest price.
her head is tiny
post the .py
It was made to be easy
Google ichimoku cloud indicator and implement it
Well, the basics are easy enough.
Make sure to learn the functions well and to know how to handle the various data types like lists, dictionaries etc.
If you're only learning for crypto purposes and want to streamline the process, I would recommend you skip all the mathy stuff like recursion and focus on API implementations.
Notice how she's the tinest one but her thighs are still among the thiccest.
I like them petite
The second from the left has her head in a freaky angle.She's like an owl-human.Would bang.
trying this hard to look KoreanWell I don't blame them for trying.
Only crypto coded 100% in Python.
Bismuth will make you rich sirs.
