ATH in Dollars :) Hold until Q2 2018 (rolling peg) for winning at this cryptogame
Sucks to think that given the price in USD, we're still less than half the ATH value in BTC.
It got pumped by pajeet, even the deluded holders on their subreddit are admitting it.
DO NOT HOLD SELL THIS SHIT!
Buy it back when it dips, then you can hold it.
LOVING this coin now.
My precious.
It can be pumped, but not by pajeet with that volume.
BITBAY>developer holds over 100 million bitbays in his personal wallet, which is 10% of the supply>outdated wallet>marketplace looks like its from the early 90's>marketplace constantly crashes, is buggy, god awful UI and its resource hoarding as all hell>you are not allowed to sell child pornography, guns, illegal drugs or fake money on the marketplace, which would be the only reason to actually use a decentralized marketplace>developer will most likely cash out and disappear once he can sell his coins at 0.10$literally a pyramid coin, no thanks
This proves you guys dont do any fucking research whatsoever .
Syscoin is literally years ahead of bitbay.
The only thing thats better about bitbay is the name.Well played again /biz/, board gets worse and worse every day.
Salty Syscoin pajeetFUCK Syscoin
