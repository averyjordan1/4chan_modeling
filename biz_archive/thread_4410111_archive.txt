Why is your main goal not trying to get Link onto bittrex?
That would cause a 3x at least
I don't think we care about 3x.
I'm not selling until we hit $5, and we will be getting there next year.
Iâ€™m expecting $50 by 2020.
Is this unrealistic?
That's not crazy at all, considering that crypto will have a trillion dollar marketcap in the future.
They won't do it because it could be considered a security
i would fucking run around the streets naked while yelling stupid shit if it reaches $50.
at this point i only need $10 to make it
$50 would do me just right
Need 20 for a mill, would prefer 30 dollar to pay the taxes and still have a million.but just being in the green would make me alot more happy, seeing this tank makes me depressed, even if i don't want to sell for over a year
4410260I need atleast 10 000$ per coin to make it
Sergey won't spend money on marketing because he's unsure if chain link coins will even work.
