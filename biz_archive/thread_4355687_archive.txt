Why won't this coin moon already?>popular with boomers and normies>available at many retailers>stable priceJust bought 500k at 0.03USD, will I get my lambo soon?
not for resale
Think one of the coins have got their name figured, should there be a hard fork.
I like these, but I accidentally bought the caramel cream filled ones last time.
Those aren't as good imo
