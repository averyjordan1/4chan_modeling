Just a reminder that BTC is headed towards 5000 and crashing with no survivors.
Its back to 8k already.
I wish it dipped to 5k so I could buy in, but it seems like no matter what happens, BTC always goes up
I'm confused.
It says we are going to 10k though.
Temp floor found?
buy back then
Prices don't just continue to drop forever that quickly.
As you can see around /biz/, there are plenty of people still haunting around for those dips to then sell up, exactly for situations like this.
You can always make money.On top of that, if people are indeed exiting the market, they'll want to hold onto BTC to convert to fiat, pumping BTC.
Thus the >ride to $10k meme.It'll go down while fluctuating, if the news is correct and market is reacting as such.
Honestly I don't think the whole market even knew what happened just then, and it'll only come around in couple days time.
