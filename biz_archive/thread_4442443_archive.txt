I bought bitcoin cash at 1260 as a long term investment.
am i fucked?
I thought the transaction time would render bitcoin useless in south america, but north america dumped more than i expected because of the freeze during the flippening.thoughts?
There will be another 3x pump when Bitcoin forks into Bitcoin One next year
This is my thought.
thank you so much.
i ten doubled my investment with gearing during the flippining, but the recent panic halfed it.check out google trends btw, really usefull for investments.

Ver still has a bunch of BTC prepped for another attack, so keep an eye out for another pump to get out on.Otherwise, fuck it, hold onto it.
There's always the micro chance the flippening might actually happen.
Might even have long-term potential as as "Asia's Bitcoin", since so many Koreans and VPN'ing chinese bought it.
ty i was so worried
Just hold and wait, probably diversify to more than just BCH in case it fails.But BCH is getting added to exchanges, merchants etc.
really fast.
And another BTC panic could happen really easily.
Transaction capacity still hasn't increased.
Mempool will clog just as easily.And if you look at trends over time, these BTC mempool spikes are larger each time.
It's the real Bitcoin, of course it's a good long term hold
