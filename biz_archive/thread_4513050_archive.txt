It's been like two hours dude.
Learn to trade on longer time frames.
ETH is the good guy of the crypto world and it doesn't deserve to be spoken about like that.
If you can't handle the good guy go find some Chad coin that will probably dump on you and leave you heartbroken.
it's just a salty ass bitcoiner.
they do this half assed fud every time eth is doing well.
they are just mad because their blockchain is only a gust of wind away from total failure.
I know rite?
>held onto my modest 15ETH for 3 months now>crashes and spikes, family emergencies and costly car repairs>didn't sell it, thinking one day it might get me out of my shitty paycheck to paycheck life.
>want to buy more with what's left st the end of every month but the price keep creeping up>it's in a horrible limbo between not low enough to buy and moonmode
I hear you but I bought 7.3 averaged in at 270ish so Iâ€™m just happy to be well in the green right now.
MFW ETH is actually supported by the globalhomo elites while BTC is seen as something to tamed and co opted and it's price driven into the ground.
You're literally using literally wrong like the literal piece of shit you are.
nice
