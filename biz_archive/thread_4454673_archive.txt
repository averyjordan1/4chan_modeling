They denied binance and even ED delisting because they wanna hit a big exchange but it's still ''secretely'' trading after the delisting on ED.
Charlie Shrem is the advisor and the product launch will be at the same time as the listing.
Thank me later.
Cindicator is prob the best bet atm.
CJEERS
you're welcome, catcha later at .10 cents
do you have proof of this tweet?seems improbable since they're not working on sundays.
seems like LARP.
its one of the founders of bittrex, not bittrex itselfs... also the fact that Charlie has connections with exchanges AND the fact that cindicator will list it on a huge exchange officialy this month makes it kinda a nobrainer.
CJEERS OP!
just bought
So no proof.
