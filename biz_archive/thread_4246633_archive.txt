see how well both of them complement each other
explain pls
Tether is being inflated and hence massively losing its value -- compared to BTC.
well considering tether is worth $1 constantly, and BTC is risingyes the ratio will go down....
Tether isnt a scam.
Bitfinex literally has more than double the USDT market cap in their private holdings.
they can afford to create new tethers.silly bizlets are paranoid
Ok, I'm confused now.Some people say Tether is a scam that will blow up, some say it's legit.Should I just hodl Bitcoin or sell it before the fork?
Any thoughts?
All in RLC the block after the fork.
i've thought about this.
Isn't Bitfinex the largest international exchange?
If so, shouldn't they be making a fuckton of money on fees and stuff?
Is it that impossible to say that they actually have the backing for tether?
