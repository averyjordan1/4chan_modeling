$100k in XMR, buy a Blocknet node for about $100k, $50k LINK, $50k SUB.You'll easily get there.
Whats a paneer?
Don't ask a whaleThey don't make any moneyFor the past 4 years at least BTC ownership has dispersed not concentrated.This should be obvious.What is fiat?Inflationarywhat does inflation do?concentrate wealth among the wealthy.What is Crypto?Deflationarywhat does deflation do?Disperses wealth to greater numbers of people.
buy link
invest a 2/6 into older altcoins (ark,omg,ardr etc.)
that are close to a point in their roadmap or even close to completion and are at a somewhat low pricepoint.invest 3/6 split between btc/eth/xmr in the order of your choosingsinvest 1/6 into a bunch of sub 60m shitcoins that haven't mooned yet
Like this, literally all you need to become a multi-millionaire next year
Bitcoin.
Ethereum.
A bunch of ark and neo to collect the payout from each would provide a nice steady passive incomeReq and link for upside
