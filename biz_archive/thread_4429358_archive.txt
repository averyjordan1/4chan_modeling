You can't cope.Sorry, I did even wrose.
I had it but i sold waiting to rebuy on a "dip" that never came.FUCK!Anyway, there is a lot of stuff that is massively undervalued right now iwth all attention of NEO and BCC.You cope by buying one of those coins.I just bought a bunch of FCT and won't sell until it does something amazing (which I expect soon)
I'm going to kms if this goes to $60.
Shouldn't it go up at least until news in 2 days???

I'm saying you cope by buying "one of the coins that is massively undervalued" while everyone is paying attention to NEO and BCCNot that you should buy NEO and BCC.I actually bought both of those at good prices but dumped too eaarly.I figured out going all-in makes me way too emotional and paranoid, so I will not do that in future because thats why I dumped BCC and NEO for like 5% instead of life changing money.
Buy gas, it is at a huge discount and will catch up with neo
Buy in, just don't sell for a year and you'll be a very happy man.
Why did you miss out?
figure that out.
apply to another top 25 coin that will get a boost next.
Perfect time to short NEO
its not too late for GNT, ARK, or MCO
