Does anyone else think another looming run on BCH will happen this weekend or in the coming month?
We might see another attempt at a flip very soon, be the first to strap in and ride this rocket and then dive back into BTC when it is cheap we have an inverse BTC so when BTC is high buy low on BCH and vice versa.Do you get it?
Hahahahah no.So many bagholders they will instantly sell so no chance of a comback.Enjoy your bags
