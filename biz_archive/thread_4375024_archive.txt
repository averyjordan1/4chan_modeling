Look at sell orders.
this shit coin is finally going down.
great, just bought 1k with my spare BTC change.
i don't care if it crashes and burns.
lol
Wow, those large orders have to mean something no?
This coin should have dies a week ago when their "devs" did not meet yet another deadline.
Then they lied to everyone and made excuses.
Neo, what if I told you "There is no wraith"
I knew I should not have trusted my friend from India on this coin
How is this shit not zero ground??
?How is it not like 0.000001 cents?Devs hyped this shit like madman, than was like "muh.. bit to much work today...muh next few days...muh somteimes".
LOL.
Looks like it is finally slipping now.
Once it goes below 90 sats it will never come back.
Notice the buy orders have dropped.
Looked like whale that has been supporting this coin is backing out.
Grab the popcorn, this slide is going to be good
