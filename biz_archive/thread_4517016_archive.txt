Absolute newfag here.I see that you can buy other coins on Binance using either BTC or ETH, is there an advantage using one over the other in this specific circumstance?What's the best way to convert your liquid funds into BTC/ETH to spend?
So far I'm doing: Coinbase -> Gdax (since for some reason there's no withdrawal fees, why though?)
-> My wallet
Pls respond I want my lambo
BTC will take MUCH longer transfer to an exchange wallet... Fees will be higher too.Buy alts on an exchange using ETH
