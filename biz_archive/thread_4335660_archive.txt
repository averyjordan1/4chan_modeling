So i am very new to crypto.
I looked at some shit guides that all seem to be for one coin or another.
What coin is the most profitable and has the least crashes.
Also, does anyone here actually mine and or trade crypto as their main source of income.
just watch youtube videos, read comments , read articles.
when you come across a word you dont know, just google it , welcome your gonna be here forever ,when you start trading start small, a fwe hundred dollars.
I trade as a job.
I make enough to not be a wagecuck but only started midsummer.
I hold Ether (ETH), Monero (XMR), and LINK.
I also mine Litecoin (LTC).
AMA
are those coin suggestions?
Any one coin i should start with.
Also do you only buy and trade, is mining not a thing anymore.
But what about REQ?REQ is the next big thing.
Right?
better question, which coin have you foun to be most profitable.
And maybe, what is your average profit from it.
Not sure if that makes sense.
Yes.
REQ.
Buy it now.
counterproductive nonsense?
