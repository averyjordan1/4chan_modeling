Bitbay will be a big of 2018.
Don't miss it
It's not a bag anymore.

Syscoin is years ahead on development.
Nice shilling though.
BITBAY>developer holds over 100 million bitbays in his personal wallet, which is 10% of the supply>outdated wallet>marketplace looks like its from the early 90's>marketplace constantly crashes, is buggy, god awful UI and its resource hoarding as all hell>you are not allowed to sell child pornography, guns, illegal drugs or fake money on the marketplace, which would be the only reason to actually use a decentralized marketplace>developer will most likely cash out and disappear once he can sell his coins at 0.10$literally a pyramid coin, no thanks
sold my bags at 480happy as a cucumber
Just stop, Pajeet.
Lots and lots of Volume testing.
I'm not over-shilling, you will regret it in few months.
