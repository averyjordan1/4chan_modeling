You can buy bitcoin on COSS.IO, its an exchange, but first use coinbase buy your btc there and deposit to COSS.IO exchange and start trading.
thank you man, that's a good start.

Not an easy time to invest.
Bitcoin core BTC just hit an all time high recently, and is tracing back downwards.
Meanwhile BCH Bitcoin Cash is a forked version of bitcoin which is challenging it for it's throneI would probably wait a few days until the dust settles before investing, otherwise you can decide between the BTC and BCH shills or hedge with both

I use plus500 leverage, they have horrible fees but their UI is great.I can just buy/sell when I want and not wait for this shit.
I wouldn't buy anything but prefork BTC offchain until BTC vs BCH is settled.
Not for gainz anyway
