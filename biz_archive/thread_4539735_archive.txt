Tfw you all thought that REQ was just a DApp.Actually, as per their latest upgrade, they make it clear that they are indeed a platform.
The financial platform of the future.> he doesn't realise this means there will be a huge dev ecosystem developing products to use on top of Request> he doesn't realise all of these products will utilise the REQ tokenQuote: Request is not an app but a financial platform on which many projects can be developed.
It is a layer on top of Ethereum simplifying the development of many features in the crypto finance space.
We want to structure cryptocurrency payments, finance and accounting areas.
Our goal is to build a platform to operate payment requests applicable for every financial flow, and structure it by allowing external systems and software to plug into the platform through the use of our APIs.
Thanks to a decentralized payment request, we can recreate all the platforms existing in the FIAT world and apply financial features in the crypto world such as invoicing, salaries, payments and many others.
This shit will moon hard
Developers will create gateways that will interact with customers and apis and will use the req token
