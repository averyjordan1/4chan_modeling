it's the messaging app that ALL the chinese use, which has built-in payment services where you can send "red envelopes" or gifts to people, and buy stuff.

If they had some clever way to stop people GPS hacking I would be more interested.
Yeah that's my biggest issue with the app, aswell as worried pajeets or bots will farm red envelops & ruin the entire project.
Curious what kinds of security there is.
