Its going down in btc value fucktard
I have 3 ETH, am I going to make it?
AAAAAAAAH HAD SO MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO BUY THIS UNDER 300 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Protip: this is going to $1000 by mid-2018.
Even if there are no news, normie-money is going to flood it as people get on Coinbase and see BTC too expensive.
If you're just hoping for $400, stop daytrading and just accumulate.
This is a mid-term hodl for those who hopped on crypto "too late".
Think of it as a bet: will ETH hit 700 before BTC hits 16k?
BTC will definitely move faster than ETH in the coming future, but if you are dealing with low funds then ETH is the better choice as it offers a better %.
If ETH breaks $370 today, it's mooning to $400.
You heard it here first.
what was meant by this?
BTC will definitely move faster than ETH in the coming future, but if you are dealing with low funds then ETH is the better choice as it offers a better %.>ETH offers a better %No it doesn't.
4466658don't forget about ICO money they will desperately try to cash out
btc will move faster>eth offers a better %Literally what did he mean by this?
People on this board actually don't understand that where the decimals on the coins coins is doesn't matter.
They think if bitcoin goes up 200$ and eth goes up $50 then bitcoin went up more.
Ethereum has been going up slower percentage wise than bitcoin for the past few months.
It has bled all the way from being worth .15BTC to being worth less than .5BTC.
>They think if bitcoin goes up 200$ and eth goes up $50 then bitcoin went up more.
That's not what we're seeing, we're seeing $10 ETH moves for $1k BTC moves.
That's because most """investors"""" in the crypto scene are retarded.
I'm starting to understand why the US has an Accredited Investor scheme to stop idiots from pissing away their money on ICO scams.
The amount of retardation on this web zone constantly leaves me asking why I’m here.
It’s mostly pumpers shilling shit to gullible noobs anyhow.
still mooning
