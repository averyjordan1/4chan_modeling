Are altcoins ever going to recover EVER?I'm fucking sick and tired of being a poor NEET loser.
I've been getting justed this whole month.
When are my coins going to pump again?
You guys said we'd all be rich by now.
I just want fucking money already come on...

What bags are you holding?
They will recover next year.
BTC will make 10k  first and stabilise
>Buying crypto on whether or not you will think they pump, and not whether or not they provide a service and solve a problem
Post your Blockfolio.

The only ones that matter and will last years from now are the Fiat paired ones like ETH, XMR, OMG, NEO, Litecoin, ect ect
