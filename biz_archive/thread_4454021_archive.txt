Was < 200 a few days ago.On 270ish now.
People are accumulating.
Platform releases 1st of December.
Look at CFD, HST, GVT, ASTRO, EPY.
Did they fucking recover from the dump after getting majorly shilled on 4chan?
No.
But DRP does.
Slowly but surely.
Natural growth is where its at.
You can still buy some cheap DRP.
December will be huge.This ain't your quick flip shitcoin /biz/.
See you on the moon.https://etherdelta.com/#DRP-ETHhttps://www.dcorp.it/
LUL drp is way more of a shit coin than Astro.
With that logic literally every coin is a p&d coin.
The market will recover for at least Astro I can assure you that.
Plus if you hold be December and your stack is big enough you can earn some serious dividend money.....
Im mostly in neo and drp right now.
Great days ahead.
Thank you biz, i both love and hate you
Why the fuck didn't see you post this when it was falling like a fucking rock the past few days?Oh wait
