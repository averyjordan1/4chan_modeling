>BTC at $7700>Alts stagnantI am never buying alts again, goddamnit.
Alts bleedingfixd for you
Alts stagnantThat's the fucking problem with having a wrecking ball like BTC as reference.
Be patient faggot.
I know, you can't help but think you are losing money, bitcoin wise, even if the alt gave you some profit.I see you are also a linker.
You've gotta get in coins like Mona that aren't so married to BTC in terms of value
The only Alt I have that's gaining profit over BTC is IOTA.
Should I liquidate my alts at a loss and hop into BTC or hold until it stabilizes and the green dildos come flowing back?
tfw portfolio is 50% BTC.
50% alts.
>Alts stagnant>just sold STATUS, made decent profit(10% over 3 days)>just sold KuCoin Shares which just mooned(20% up in 24 hours)Yeah, totally stagnant dude.
Stay far away.
What exchange should I use if I live in the UK?
Need a wallet now!
Just using OMG as an example, if you were balls deep in OMG right now, ask your self will bitcoin hit 15k before OMG hits 15 USD?
If yes, sell, if no, hold.
You could also hedge a little by selling SOME of your stack.
BTC marketcap needs to increase another 120 billion dollar to double your investment>the alts I hold only need a couple hundred million to go 10xlogic made me go with option 2, but option 2 has made my life a living hell the last couple of months.
Do you have less alts now?
Alts stagnantYou bought the wrong alt
I wish I was as smart as you anaon
At this point at least 80% of investors have to be underwater.
Market cap is a made up number, and it's a function of the price, not the other way around.
