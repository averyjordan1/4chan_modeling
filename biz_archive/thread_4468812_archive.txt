Q2 2018 when main net goes live
This time next year.
It'll be similar to when ETH was $7 and then $300 a year later, except this time you will actually have bought early
That's a good idea.
It's exactly the same kind of FUD that happened with IOTA.
Basically /biz/ kept calling it a cuckcoin and blah blah blah.
Price went down all the way almost to 25 cents or something.
I bought it at near ATH...
But now I'm stiting pretty caaamfy.Fuck the fudders on /biz/.

>oh my I could have bought Netflix at $113 and sold at $204!Where something has been is irrelevant.
Where is it going is all that matters!!!!!!!!!
