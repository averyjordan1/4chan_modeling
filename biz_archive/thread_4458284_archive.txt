Currently holding 0 ETH, should I buy some?
Does it have the potential to hit $1k?
If so, how long would that take?
I might just go all in BTC just because it will go up at a faster rate than ETH will.
shoulda bought in at 10$, it will hit $ in 2019.
It's a shitcoin that gets hacked all the time.
Yes and yes.
Yes eth will at some point supersede btc.
Worst case it hits $2k in a year.
I set a buy at $320 a couple of days ago and now I'm worried it will never hit that again.
This shit was glued to $300 for so long that I was sure if would dip.
