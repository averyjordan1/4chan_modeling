The price of BCH is even more fake than BTC's.Coinbase and BITMex still have customer's BCH locked up.
The latter is going to dump it for BTC and Coinbase is going to credit it around January, I think.https://blog.bitmex.com/site_announcement/bitcoin-cash-futures-now-live/
Why didn't you keep your BCH from the fork?
You could be super comfy, sitting on 11BTC+11BCH instead of fearing any flippening.
After the failed flippening event I finally noticed something.
The more bitcoin is attacked the stronger it becomes.
I finally shed all worries about its long term success.
PUT IT ALL ON BCHI FUCKING DARE YOU

 BCH0 BCTNot even scared.
Your shit will be worthless soon.
Don't worry my btcbro ATH today!
Btc 10% Bch fags still carrying their bags
For is anyone who is hoping for the flippening: I understand that you are hoping because you've got the potential to have way more coin that way, but do you realize it would destroy and de-legitimize the entire crypto market if anything dethrones the core chain (regardless of whether Core deserves it or not)?
