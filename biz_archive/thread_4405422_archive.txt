FRIENDLY REMINDER TO NOT BUY WHEN IT'S ALREADY MOONING.
IF YOU DIDN'T GET IN BEFORE, DON'T TRY OR YOU'LL LOSE MONEY.
DON'T FALL FOR THE FOMO.
THIS BOARD IS FULL OF PAJEETS TRYING TO PUMP COINS AND THEN FUCK YOU IN THE ASS WITH THEIR BAGS, THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.
says the bitcoin holder to anyone thinking about leaving bitcoin.
This is not about bitcoin.
It's about jumping mid mooning and losing like a retard, it happens all the times, that's why we have more pink wojaks than every other meme in this board.
but how is the price going to continue mooning if people dont buy in while its mooning?
