Hey Biz, I've got some ETH in Binance that I'm trying to buy BTC with.
But I can't find an exchange option from ETH to BTC?
Only BTC to ETH.
Am I just retarded?
Can anyone help?
Please.
nice try but nobody is this retarded
It's listed as BTC/ETH Go on the BTC pairings drop down
But that's buying ETH using BTC.
I want to buy BTC using ETH.
So I'm looking for an ETH/BTC pairing?
