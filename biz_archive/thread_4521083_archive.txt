This shits just got listed to binance and is trading below ico price.
Should I buy in now?
Yea.
Anything that just newly gets listed will have a pretty good run.
We've seen it the last few weeks with multiple coins.
Usually end up going 150%
It's moving a bit too slow for my liking and it doesn't seem to be getting much attention.
I may leave it for now
i calculate ico price was .02 cents.its trading well above that pajeet sir.
https://icodrops.com/etherparty/According to that, it's below ICO price.
Look at that .43x btc return.
Where did you get $0.02 from though?
It`s dumping.
Price is 300% higher than yesterday price .
Yesterday low was 0.02$
I didn't even bother to check its history.
That's where the 0.02 came from.
