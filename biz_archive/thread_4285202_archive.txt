How many of you are in the red?
Be honest.
I bought BTC at $1000 so I really can't lose at this point :^)
I'm colorblind, you tell me>bought at $242
fucking justed every single fucking day when does the pain end fucking aaaaargh
like overall?thats genuinely not possible at this point, i've already pulled out 2x my initial investment, and still sitting on $10k in cryptoyou would have to be a fucking retard to lose money in a market this lucrative
green in USD value, red in btc value (but it doesn't matter since this is not the real btc and it is going to crash because of flippening soon)
still up 2x initial investment....i missed so much fucking moon missions and am bagholding so much bullshit, that it feels way worse though.
LINK JUST'D the fuck out of me.
I think im somewhere around 10% down atm, but at my highest i was up by 6k or almost 200%well you could but you'd have to be very stupid.
Some people are; if you buy high sell low enough times you'll cuck yourself
I am down more than 60% since i started
compared to when?
from the start?
I'm up more than x100from 4 days ago?
I'm down 10%
I started in june and I'm only up 2.5x my initial :/I guess that's not very good but I lost some money at first and after that I started only doing really safe moves.
that is thoroughly impressive, anonwhen did you start?
in the past 1-2 months?if you had bought just about anything before the August 1st fork, you would be in atleast 300%+ profits right now
Can someone give me a "how to convert my worthless fiat currency to BTC, without getitng jewed" guide
August 16th was my entry.
Literally started losing money hours after.
Never came close to it again.
I stopped doing trades the last month and just accepted all my investments are losses and will never come back.

Buy Bitcoin on Coinbase2.
Transfer to Poloniex and buy Bitcoin Cash
I put everything in iota before the August fork so I'm just back to 0 net gain
