it wasn't even that big of a dip
It's a good sign, if a 30 million dollar fuck up can't shake peoples faith in bitcoin then we're going to see huge gains next year
Just woke up, why did it dip?
tether got hacked and is on life support
LOL you guys are in for a little surprise.
Now that the Tether drama is all over 10k+
enlighten us
Don't worry about it... TA is just a meme after all right?
Right???
what exactly is the point in a discussion board where no discussion happens?
I made a pretty little picture since I know you guys need a lot of help reading charts.
Oh and "C" ends at about $5,750.
I think there needs to be a pretty big news event for BTC to go below $6000 again (although I'll be ready to buy if it does).
Remember the last dip was 'china is banning bitcoin' which was pretty big news at the time.
What do you think will cause this next dip?
what exchange do you get to use these graph?
I fucking HATE Bitcoin because I never get on itTHe market sucks when there is only one faggy coin and its fucking this goddam coin .
I never buy the btc dip because I want it to DIE now I missed oiut on huge gains AGAINAAAAAAAAA
Nice meme lines, but what bearing do they actually have?
I don't like BTC either, but i love money, and thus far i't hasnt let me down
True because there is no such thing as a bull trap... oh wait we had one 4 days ago.
