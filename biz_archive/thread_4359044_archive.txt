im too scared to use bitmexalso i was watching dash futures the other day when the price went nuts and noticed that there was a huge spread between the futures and actual value of the coin.
i can see myself getting burned hard by this :(
futures.dude wtf, just use bitmex cunt.

 I just flip alts, and hold btc when its pumping, just to buy alts when they bleed low, then flip again for more btc.I've never got into shorting/ longing.
Should I?
i dont know dude, if what you're currently doing is working why would you blow it ?
longingis buying you retard
>Literally can't trade BTC/USD if my life depended on itI swear, every decision on that pair is wrong for me, if I buy in an uptrend, it reverses immediately, same for shorting.
I make steady gains on alts though, but I just don't understand BTC it seems.
