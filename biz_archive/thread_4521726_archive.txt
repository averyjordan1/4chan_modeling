Make sure to grab a couple BTG before the real pump.
You guys don't believe me?
Every one is going to be fudding around with BCH today, but tomorrow the true king rises.
its getting harder to ignore this shit coin.
Its been super proffitible so far.
One good pump but that's it so far considering the shitstorm a couple weeks ago.It's blown past now, so I dropped a bit on this.Bags set to sell just under 0.045 for a cozy profit.
