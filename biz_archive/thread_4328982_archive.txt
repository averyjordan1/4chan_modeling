Alright boys.
No dumb shills here.
-BTG trading today -BCH war vs BTC -People want reliability and stability which none of those coins offer ATM>Bitcoin Gold futures are currently being priced at ~$382 per coin (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-gold/), for a total implied market cap of ~$6.35b-Even if you assume only 1% of Bitcoin Gold is sold for VTC = ~$63.5m of added inflows (~40% upside from current price or ~$5.5 per VTC)-miner difficulty adjustment just happened on BCH

Yes anon.
It is expected to pump in the following days.
Don't ask me, just zoom out and look at the bigger picture.
No dude, POW is discredited forever after this.
It will take some time but the discussion will start even in the mainstream media and it will end badly for all POW coins.
