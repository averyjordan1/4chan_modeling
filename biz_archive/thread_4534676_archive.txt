Why?
because the community of rabid, deluded bagholders waiting sell provides so much obvious resistance that big investors are completely turned off.
They know that it's not worth the resources to pump a coin that has such a dedicated following.
Why do you think that the dumbest coins moon overnight?
It's because nobody cares about them and there's no resistance.
"b-b-but muh natural repeating pattern!"
You poor, deluded Arkie.
Ark had a big pump ONE TIME because of the Chinese sell-off during the China crypto ban event.
They were using Ark as a hedge since it was a western-only coin.
That LITERALLY the only thing propping up the chart.Deep down you know that I'm right.
This is a vaporwave shitcoin that will never go ANYWHERE.
Thanks anon.
Just sold 100k
You are god damn right we aren't selling.
You think I buy Ark for overnight moons?
Or faggot degenerate pnd gains?No, no, no.Sir, you see, Ark is the future of crypto.
It will become the Google Translate for all blockchains.
The whole world will use it.Ark is my savings account, my retirement fund, my beloved first crypto.
I earn more Ark dividends on my wallet monthly than I do from my bank savings account yearly.So, you should be happy that it is taking it's time to build a strong foundation, because you are still being gifted the opportunity to board the Ark anon.
Don't miss it.
