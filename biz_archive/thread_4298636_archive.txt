NULS STATUS UPDATE
Considering buying some more now.
Would it be wise to wat till it dips below 60 cents?
their website and white paper look like shit
It may or may not hit there again.
But let me ask you this.
Is 0.65 really a deal-breaker for something that we found out about before the rest of the western world?
When it was over $1 yesterday?
On a coin with only 40M circulating?
That has the potential to be the actual real Chinese ETH?
I have been buying this thing every single time it dips, with the exception of when I have gone to sleep.
I'm either going down with the ship or gloating next month all over /biz/ how I was the one shilling NULS for 3 days straight.
