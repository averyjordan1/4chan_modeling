W-we are the sigtmarinesWho is still with me?
a race long forgotten...
The sigtmarines was my first OC.Sad times
Sig was the first coin I invested in, during that turbo shilling period a few months back.It taught me a valuable lesson - always take profits on alts during moons (at least enough to cover your initial investment).
I've stuck to this, and have been able to profit through Link, VTC, Adex, and MCO.All thanks to losing $200 on Sig.
you are lying lol.
