Decred is getting a ASIC developed for it meaning when people start mining with ASIC on decred the difficulty will go up and it will be overall harder to mine Decred.
Decred is about at the bottom of the chart which is where I bought in.
Also Lighting network releasing sometimes next week.
At least take a look at it.
P-pajeet...
Stfu this is actually a good coin, its both proof of stake and proof of work making it invunerable to hard forks and 51% attacks.
Its a hybrid type coin and will soon decrease in supply due to the ASIC development.
Very nice!
I would definetly want to buy at this low price, its already hit near the bottom of the chart and isn't looking to go down more unless bitcoin makes a run over 8k.
