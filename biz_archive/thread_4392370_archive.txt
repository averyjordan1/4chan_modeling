The most rational advice if he doesn't want to make much money, yes.
You're going to military for 1 month?
Wtf does that even mean?
You are joining in a month... pretending to be in the military for one month... already in but going TDY for a month?
He may make 10-20% if he's lucky.
You're right, he should waste his money on pump and dump shitcoins and hold the bags for months

Another military anon here.
He probably means he is going away on exercise or something.
