I just sunk my life savings 125000 USD into bitcoin at 8361.3 USD today.Did I just make a huge mistake?
Long term, no.
All in at all time high
No, 10k incoming Don't belive the fud on tether, CME, etc....you did good anon.>oldfagbiztard Said it's coming
I'd just like to interject for a moment.
What you’re referring to as Bitcoin, is in fact, Blockstream Coin, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Shitcoin.
Blockstream Coin is not Satoshi's vision, but rather another component of Jewish bankers controlling the monetary system.
sell now
kek.
you'll be ok chad, switch to bitcoin cash before $10k
proof or nah
you bought at ath but the chance you bought at the last top ever is very slim so youre good.
Probably not, just be sure to sell just before it touches 10k because the crash will be of biblical proportions
If you cannot form an opinion on whether bitcoin cash or bitcoin is bitcoin then you have made a huge mistake
4492950Why?
u are fucked.
get ur money out now in case ur not larping
because ur dad told me he's gonna break bitcoin
I'm thinking of keeping it in a paper wallet and putting it into a safety deposit box for 5 years.Thoughts?
when bitcoin crashes back down to 5000 soon, you may get distraught, and may even get suicidal, but please remember its only temporary, and dont do anything drastic.
bitcoin WILL get above 10k and beyond in the coming months

Hey OP, I'm rooting for you!
buying near ath>when it's obvious crypto is about to get goxxed againEither get out now or get ready to HODL for a bunch of years.
No.
But you must be mentally prepared for a 3+ year bear market at any moment like in 2013
