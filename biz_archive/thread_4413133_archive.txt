WTF so much news yesterday.
i bought in at 3800. i need to dump these bags tho.
I'm just worried if i should wait a few days for the spike and not take the lose or set up a sell for like 3200 and hope it sells while I'm at work todaywhat are ya'll doing with your heavy ass ripple bags ??
?to sell at loss or HODL, that is the question..
It depends, in the long run you stand to make a profit, but you can eat your loss now, get in something more profitable and buy back in at a later date.
Ripple won't do much till spring of 2018
sold my bags at 30% loss, fuck it.
This space is retarded now.BTC kills all bullruns, just look at LTC.
Huge news and its being cucked by BTC.
