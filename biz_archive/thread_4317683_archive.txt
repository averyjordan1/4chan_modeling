Two days people were talking about BCH pump, that will pump like hell and even more on monday because some announcment or whatever.
Any soild information about this?
We will have a announcement or anything like that?
Links?Btw, this is not another thread "X coin will die, fuck you X coin, Y coin is/will_be the king" yada yada, you all already have 666 threads to argue about this autism and act like a cheerleader about a bunch of zeroes and ones..., I already secured my profit, I just want to check if the info has anything solid or its just bullshit.
and you believed us.
lol
difficulty adjustment on monday, if bch maintains the mining pool it will pump, that is if it can be profitable, so over 2000$/coin
he was the normie
The announcement already happened: the Segwit2x fork is not going to happen anymore, so the only good big block Bitcoin version is BCH.BCH will have a new difficulty adjustment algorithm tomorrow, but this probably wont affect the price too much.
If it goes well, then it is only a sign that the devs at BCH are doing a good job and the price surge resumes.
