Just made this.
It is a minable ethereum token inspired by bitcoinereum, but it can only be mined for the first week of every year for the next 120 years.
It's really just a novelty and the first solidity program I ever wrote.
There are 100,000,000 total tokens and with 10,000,000 set as the reward for the first 5 years and halving every 5 years.
The mining reward starts at 100 and halves every year, hopefully I didn't fuck anything up.
