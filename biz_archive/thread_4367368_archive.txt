At work I interact with the general public.
An extremely high level executive of a local bank is someone I talk to maybe once every two weeks.
Last time I saw him, I brought up crypto, and he laughed and said he had a few btc years ago but sold, wished he kept it.Then I asked if he knew about chainlink since the whole swift thing.
He had no clue and said the government would shut it down once it gets big enough.
Believe me or not, this guy is literally a top end executive in charge of a credit division at a large regional bank.
He worked for Visa before moving on.
He thinks the government will "shut down" Bitcoin and hasn't even heard of any alts.
I told him crypto might disrupt payments with omg, link, req and other projects and he just laughed it off.Another fact: if you ask 100 random people about Alt coins, how many would own any?
The only things anyone had even heard of are btc, eth, and ltc because theyre on coinbase.
Fucking no one knows about ark, link, omg req or anything else.
You're still early enough.
And you're still gonna make it.
What's the next that's being added to cuckbase?Link?
They said they're open to adding token and released the criteria they will use.
My guess is omg will be added, along with maybe neo.
Also btc cash is supposedly added around new years
