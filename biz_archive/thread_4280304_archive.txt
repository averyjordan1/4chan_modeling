Is this a really bad time to enter the stock market?
I'm looking to buy some meme index funds with some of my gains.Best strategy to enter?
Average in over a year or two?
>Buy BOTZ>Hold
well your buying at the height of a boom, so if you're prepared for a crash at some point go for it, just be ready to pull out more efficiently than your parents
The stock market bubble will burst in 2018
Don't do it.
Stay in crypto.
wait until drumpf is replaced that will be the best time to get some low priced stocks
I'm to dumb to understand finance, i have heard that in general the stock market increases about 4-7% each year, wouldn't that mean that it is essentially a permanent bubble that will grow until the inevitable collapse of society?
4280327people keep saying this, but how do I know it's going to happen?
this is why I'm considering averaging instead.
I'm looking to invest long term and hold as I don't have the time and interest to follow the normie marketsI have too much of my net worth in crypto already.
I want to lock in some gains.
Because OP, history repeats itself and you can try to deny it, but based on market trends its coming soon.
Long term holds should be fine.
