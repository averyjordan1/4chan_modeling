>he bought the BCH dipkek
I've made 5x my money with this "shitcoin", which is a lot better than bitcoins did over the same timeAfter every ath the corecucks have said this, and every time they have been wrongStay delusional/coping.
Stay a corecuck

I got it for free

I did but bought some extra at 250 bong.The true cryptogods sold their bitcoin before the fork and went all in on bitcoin cash though.The literal retards (biz) sold immediately after the fork
You do know you're supposed to hodl this coin, right?
Who the hell cares about a measly -12% when the price is going to increase exponentially over the next 5 to 10 years?
Good call, before the fork I was talking shit here about throwing all over to BCH but I pussied out when the time came, now I just hodl both and consider the price of bitcoin to be 7700
Makes me think of my time dabbling in RBY (one of the shittier shitcoins) a few years ago.
I had so many of those that I honestly could have been a millionaire at one point if only I hodled.Oh well.
measly -12%Nigger, it's over -50% since you bought it 2 days ago.
Find small exploit on bitcoin PoW.
Make ASIC miners that take advantage of that.
Patent it so I can sue other people who try to copy me.
Upgrade to bitcoin would nullify my exploit (Segwit) https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/asicboost-the-reason-why-bitmain-blocked-segwit-901fd346ee9fSpam the network with small fee transactions to clog the mempool http://i.imgur.com/cmRIBIM.png (embed) https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24h https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/58166/who-is-spamming-the-bitcoin-cash-mempool-and-whyTell people that we need bigger blocks and not the new upgrade Fork the coin so I can keep mining it with my special miners.
Actually no good programmers so I fuck up the difficulty adjustments but that's ok I have to mine 60% of the hashrate but that's ok, people won't know that I am centralizing this coin https://cryptovest.com/news/bitcoin-cash-watch/Collude with the other chinese miners to finally get rid of core developers, then I can increase miner reward easily https://twitter.com/ViaBTC/status/876047086533214208Rent russian social farm for a few days Pump up the price from a 0% fee exchange in korea by buying my own coins and trading 3x the actual sell book Finally get rid of the programmers who want to get rid of my advantage Once I have all the power, I can fork the coin to allow miner reward to be biggerIf you buy BCH, you are being manipulated.
my copypaste keeps getting mangled, holy shit, do some work before you paste it man
Unless you got out at 0.4 or 0.5 methinks you are lying
