Back above $6000.
Time to ride the BTC money train again boys.
the only reason bch is not dumping stupid hard is because the chinks can't dump while bithumb is down, once it goes online again every chink will dump
Rip btc, bch will take over.
bch has seen the top.btc has hit floor hard
bought a little @ $5600wish i'd bought more, but panic was surrounding me
yeah i doubled down then too8am and still havent slept because i wanna see how it goes if/when bithumb comes back
Maybe yes, but today is not the day.
BCH is too scary right now.
People will take their money and go back to the warm motherly bosom of BTC after enjoying their time in the whorehouse.
BCH had its fling, but until it matures, it will be a mere meme.
