Why is powr tanking
ZENLINK (I think the BTC value is below presale)MODETHXMR
WTC - 40%XRP - 25%XLM - 20%VTC - 15%I keep meaning to buy the dip and get some BTC but the dip is never the time to cash out my bags.
Stellar will moon soon.
Insider info from their meetups.
It's already very undervalued anyways.
With that amount of supply I'm surprised it's even at three cents
Buy the rumor sell the news.
Everyone who got in late is holding bags.
Same shit as always.

POWR has no rumor or news, what you on about?
Ripple is twice the supply and that shit is 20c.Stellar should be at top 10 marketcap considering what it can do and the amount of business partners coming in.
This guy seems risky.Feel like he might induce some kind of row with IBM, as he did with Ripple.He has vision, so perhaps he'll make IBM into his minions.
Doing menial tasks that he feels are beneath him.
Like ensuring security.
DOGEmy biggest mistake ever.

This guy seems risky.In an industry filled with convicts, racketeers, scammers and communists a guy with a solid resume is "risky"?
