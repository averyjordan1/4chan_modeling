BCH regret threadHow much have you lost for not dumping at the peak, anons?>down 30% because I bought in again at 0.26 and waited for a pump from Korea which never came
Hahahhahahahahahhahahaggagagaga
I will never understand this fomo behavior, still holding my bch dividend from august
% down, thanks jihan, you fuckI was 20% up until I decided to actually use the currency for it's intended purpose and transact it between wallets to cash out for the day... in the transaction confirmation time, BOOM, rip mone
I don't understand how you guys didn't sell the second it passed ETH's market cap.
Protip : Out of 5 chink pumps , 4 were with double spikes.
You may try hodling and dumping ASAP
I bought BCH at $380 right after I was given free BCH after the fork
I'm down fucking 47k.
I worked really hard to build up my account and have lost a quarter to this fucking chink scam coin
