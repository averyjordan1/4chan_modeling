>Corecucks actually believe they will hit 10k and beyondThe bigger they are the harder they fall, meanwhile BCH is getting cheaper and cheaper like a coil being pushed down ready to spring any moment.
All it'll take is some inevitable bad news for BTC at its ATH and its over.When the contraction in BTC happens BCH will break 3k next year, set your sell orders early lads and screencap this.
its like quicksand the more posts like this the deeper you get sucked incongrats on this,seriously
I think BTC is not going higher cause of its functionality, which has essentially been crippled.
It's only going up as a maymay.
I think buying it is an easy 2.5x win.
If you are a fan of bch, you can then replow your profits into it later, when it starts to go up.
