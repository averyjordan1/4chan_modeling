Is it finally safe to move back into BTC?
Nope, wait for the Bitcoin war to finish.
It is and was always safe
Im waiting for it to be over to buy any more, all my holdings are in alts
so buying at ATH, never change /biz/
go into eth to be safe / long term, BCH if you wanna increase your portfolio, btc is a lost cause
Just moved out of ETH as it seems like it just keeps on dropping because people go back into BTC.
Made profit from it but I don't want to lose it all now, Monero was worth it tho, I'm keeping a third in XMR.
Look on the exchanges at the solid amount of btc being pumped in to bcc by the whales.
Pre-pump 'n dump.
This war ain't over.I'm debating pumping my btc and chunk of fiat in to bcc right now.
I hope anons got on
