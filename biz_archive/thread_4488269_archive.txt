Where will you be and what will you be doing?
I've been living under a rock.
Please tell what's going to happen.
If it's one of your shitcoins, fuck off.

He probably still thinks a BCH/BTC 'flippening' is going to happen because BTC difficulty is adjusting (even though by the looks of it difficulty is barely going to change)
I think you're missing information OP.
NO one's gonna know what you're talking about.
kek, people still think the flippening is a thing?
It's gonna feel good when BCH dumps when difficulty changes and nothing actually happens
Op, i'm on your side.
How much longer do you think AntPool and BTC.com will continue to mine Bitcoin?
