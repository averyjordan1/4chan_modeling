happy birthday op the best gift I could give you is a red pill>you will lose money instead of making it day trading >you're not more intelligent than the thousands that have tried it already.
you aren't a special snowflakedon't day trade
Happy Birthday Anon.If it makes you feel better my plan was to be rich/retire by the time I was 30 and I woke up dead broke on my 30th.
On my 31st I made it though, so theres always more time.
I am going to prove you wrongI'm not begging
Have you failed at day trading yourself?
Or just think everyone can't win like you
If you're like me you're always in a coin that doesn't pump while others do.
Feels bad man.
Happy birthday :^)are you rich and retired now
happy birthday anon.
my birthday is on friday, and im not rich yet either.
we'll make it though soon bro.
love you
