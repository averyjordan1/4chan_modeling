Pro Tip: Coins with 5 threads shilling them on /biz/ have already moonedI'm going to shill you a coin that has been under the radar for awhile now, it was forgotten as it was delisted until a week or so ago.LRC launched on Binance at the worst possible time, height of China FUD during ICO ban, meaning that it had to offer refunds within a few days of its initial listing.
As a result, its binance listing was pulled and when FUD cleared it was not on the exchange for people to buy (see Walton for a good example of what happened to other Chinese coins).LRC is now listed again, it is a major partner of both NEO and QTUM with Da Hongfei (top NEO dev) as a major backer and HODLer.
Whales are getting in now, don't miss out
Agreed, now is the time to accumulate if you want huge gains
shu.........what do I do anons
Seriously, Bancor is basically a known scam at this point and has twice the marketcapI was in Walton at $1.50 and it had threads all over biz for a few weeks after ICO.
Then the threads disappeared, and a few weeks later after everyone forgot about it was when it went to Mars.A month ago people were making threads about LRC but no one could buy itMoon mission when people finally remember
been listed for a while now bro
I've been accumulating this with my profits for months.
Did the same for VERT and it worked well.
DYOR, gangstars.
It was unlisted when Chink coins were getting all the love.Then BTC had a massive bullrun that caused an alt massacre, this was when LRC was relistedThen Segwit got cancelled, immediately followed by the BTC/BCH civil warWe haven't seen another alt bull run and this will pull a Walton when that happens again
It was unlisted when Chink coins were getting all the love.They still are.
hsr,nulls,yoyow.
Yet this coin doesnt budge
LRC is getting listed on Bittrex this month, I already said too much, it's your fault if you don't get in.
