Have 2 ETH flying around on Etherdelta because I was about to get me some DRP, but since it's about to get dumped hard, I'm thinking about putting it into DOVU or QVT.Thoughts?
Prayers?
QVT looks good atm
They've both already been pumped.
RDN or REQ are probably better options.
Dovu, fool
EDO thats what I put my DRP gains into
DOVU>already pumped
How is QVT pumped?
Mcap is like $500k or something?
