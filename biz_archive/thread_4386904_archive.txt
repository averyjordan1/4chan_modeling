What's the HMRC's position on crypto-gains?
I've seen a bunch of people saying not to fuck with the IRS - is HMRC any different?>inb4 fuck off HMRCJust a curious bong
Only some vague legislation from 2013 with barely any case law to backup so remember that this could change (law is not set in stone) >Each case will be reviewed on a case by case basis >If it's decided that your gains formed part of a logical investment plan you will be hit with capital gains>If it's seen as speculation, enjoy that sweet tax free (same tax as gambling winnings, i.e zero) researching, buying and holding bitcoin for 2 years for the purpose of obtaining long-term growth = most likely capital gains Day trading alts with margin, riding the steep lines and losing money alongside winning = speculation.Alter history of your profits from crypto accordingly to appease hmrc, 17/18 will probably be the last time you will be able to tax free cash out, regulation is coming any day thanks to increasing market size and widening of investor pool.
