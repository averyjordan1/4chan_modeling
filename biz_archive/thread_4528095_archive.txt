>active developers team>news coming out every week>ahead their route>ETH on new ATHs, REQ going up regardless of this>broke triangle pattern, retested, and still ascendingwhat is your reason for not getting in for this moon mission?
I wish i knew about this coin before, i bought a bit now and plan to buy more before tomorrow.
I just wish i will arrive in time before the real moon, with such low marketcap the possibility to increase is really high (plus coin burning).
Long term holder will surely buy even at higher price because this project will be huge once delivered.

Hi - Mod here from the unofficial Telegram group; REQ has unfortunately rode straight into a perfect storm of headwinds since ICO (0.0002 ETH);1, Agitated Whales (limited holdings) and novice ICO participants who disappointingly were in for 'flips';2, Binance SNAFU with dual issuing3, Multiple BTC forks and market consolidation back to BTC; and,4, The discovery of Binance hot wallet bags (Still trying to rectify from the listing mistakeThis was identified, and REQ bagholders (myself being one) began to 'let the bot sell to us' to divest the holdings.
This has triggered some more awareness in the TA community, hence an acceleration.Once the exchange wallet is diluted sufficiently - I have expectation of prices ascension far beyond ICO price
How much REQ do you guys have?
I only have 5000.
