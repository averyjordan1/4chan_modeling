Bch is preparing for a massive pump.
It won't be a flippening, but I'm thinking we'll see 2.5k again.
that shit is crashing too
It would be absolutely hilarious when hash power switches over to BCH just around when everyone's trying to cash out their BTC by transferring it to a fiat exchange.
PUMP IT
Yeah no it's crashing with BTC.
Not yet senpai.
Operation Dragonslayer starts in 3 days.
BTC IS ON A DOWNTREND FROM HERE ONWARD, PREPARE YOU ANUS OR JOIN BCH!
IT IS THE TETHERING!!
1086 is the bottom
on the bright side of all this fud, bch did appear to have broken out of its down trend right before the tether news.
heavy bags, eh?
