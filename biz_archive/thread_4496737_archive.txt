how do we get this stuff?
i read bittrex will give us bitcoin gold but depending on our BTC holding but i don't see it anywhere.
and just now I saw it trading in another shitty exchange
they gave me 1 btg this week, I sold that shit for xzc, I got 10 xzc more.
just show up on your wallet?
Which day.
i didn't see it
yes in bittrex wallet.
I kept 1 btc at that time of fork , so I see 1 btg today.
