I'm down 17% in one week.
I'm gonna need a fucking break from this.
I'll be back one BTC dips.
Please, i was down 50% in 1 day.
Up 50% the next day.
Idk man maybe you should stop chasing pumps and just hold good coins.ETH and BTC are 65% of my portfolio
It was because I panic sold BTC 3 times and bought back.
Ah I used to do that too.
Lost 1.28btc of my 4btc stack that way.Don't try to trade.
I suck, you suck, we all suck yet think we're good.
Only the whales know what they're doing
Okay anon you made me feel better.
Still sitting this one out.
I know BTC will crash soon and I'll buy more of it when it does.
Hopefully BCH dies.
I'm still at a 500% profit
