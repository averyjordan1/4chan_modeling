Why do some people hold LINK when its giving them -20% losses in BTC every week?
I would say an buy later to get more LINK for my BTC.
Just an advice no FUD.Stop looking at the USD price, that doesnt matter.
Because they bought it for the 3 year graph not the 2 month one.
LINK is revolutionary.
Cause you will never time the market and will FOMO at ATH.>holding bitcoin when bitfinex is about to exit scam and tether will wipe the price back to 4000
That's a meme.
Holding alts died when tether started printing infinite fake money and pumping the price like crazy.Doesn't work anymore.
There's is nothing to time, they already said there's nothing coming up anytime soon.
This is the perfect opportunity to sell and buy later if you like the project so much, "I held ants back then so it should work now heheh".
Bitfinex wasn't pumping btc everyday back then.
New rules, adapt or die.
Pretty much this But also, the recent rally shows just how little it would take to send this thing into the stratosphere.
LINK rose 20% just off the back of a rumor of an announcement.
Imagine what it will do once there is actual newsTruth is no one knows what is going to happen (this is part of the reason why people get so frustrated - bad communication from the team) but you want to be on the rocket when it does take off otherwise you'll fomo in at a higher price
