Just throwing this out there, but the head dev is going to release the update within hours and this shit is going to give a nice return if you buy in now..
LOL this shit has been said for months man, give this shitcoin up before they all dump today.
God damn man.... fucking verge...
kek go die in the corner stupid bagholder
ahahahahaha good one
I'm on the Slack and there is no new.
More adoption, but no update news.
I hope I want to get rid of this coin.
On paper it all sounds nice.
But they can't be trusted.
Wraith should be released last monday with a countdown and everything.
Yeah.
Wraith was supposed to come out 3 fucking months ago.The wallet is just a copy pasta piece of shitty crap that doesn't even work well.fuck this pajeet coin.
Lmfao if you're new just know this is a shitcoin that's been a pump from the very start
You can actually watch this coin die today.
It is happening right now.
There is typically a bot that holds three large 10+ bitcoin buy walls about 10% under market price.
Once sell orders get close they disappear.
Right now they are gone.
I am going to have to get popcorn for this next hour
Cool, just bought 10 Verge Coins!
All of them shiny and new.
Like a Vergin!
