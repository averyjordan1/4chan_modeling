Yes.
I’ve bought in.
It is a small portion of my crypto portfolio.I’ve seen companies with no real world practical applications soar from 20c to $4-$10 within a few short months.
Their team can barely parse two sentences together, made up of 22 year old graduates (probably paid a few dollars an hour- yes most of these ICOs are in Asia with negligible minimum wage laws) and a single 40 year old lead.PowerLedger on the other hand is a CES finalist.
Has a team structured as a company should be.
Proper scientific leaders.
Accounting and finance.
Analysts and programmers.They’ve also won an $8M government grant for proof of concept.For comparison: Walton chain WTC was trading at around $1.
It skyrocketed to $8 because they won a small contract with a Chinese region worth far less than POWR.
And now it’s stable around the $5 mark.Remind me in January.
Yeah.
I have vested interest.
So does every single share holder or coin holder in the world.
This is a 4chinner for POWR.
What kind of post do haters expect?
That said.
Nothing I’ve stated is a lie.
116mm capWorth a look, but no one here should knee-jerk buy
Dang.
I read what you said, and I am inspired and motivated to invest in the Power Ledger Token.
Thank you OP, I will remember you when I get my percent gains
Honestly the most incredible opportunity any of you link sandbag retards will ever see.
This project didn't explode into existence at the ICO.
Jemma Green has been a huge figure in Perth's solar uprising and the technologies that back POWR have been in development long before the token.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VZX4kUKteYLast year alone Perth saw ~35% increase in solar panel installations.
Educate yourself on the germination event in Q3 2018 because it is going to launch into another universe.
The token will literally allow people to mine it using solar power, or to invest in others people's solar assets for proportional returns.
We're just coming over the horizon now boys.
