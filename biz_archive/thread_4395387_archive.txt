Do you expect it to go up or down?This Binance competition sucks, it takes the price quite stagnant.
The project has no balls.
It tries to be everything and nothing at the same time.
Plus the competition is for total trading volume including selling.
it will break my wallet
I know, who dumped at midnight when the competition began it's already at a steady first position, now he can even trade with bots and keep it stagnant for a week and he already won.
That's what makes it stagnant, as soon as it moves even a little bit above buy in price it's dump time, buy again a bit lower and repeat
5 more days of this bullshit.Binance I think are about to be done with the 'we care about our users' initial facade now that they got loads of volume.
Watching the admin attitude turn more and more self-centered by the day.
How is that contest setup legal anyway?
I'm wondering like some others if we should put some reputational pressure on them on twitter because of this situation.
