Serious talk here, how useless is a law degree nowadays?
Law school is basically a circlejerk of people who think they know more about the system than the common working man.
All these disgusting freaks do is memorize one shitty constitution that can be easily changed in times to come so that they can manipulate others.
Law is useless, you don't learn anything by doing it and it requires no talent.
If you're doing law right now, you should feel fucking disgusted.
Law is useless, you don't learn anything by doing it and it requires no talent.One day you might become intelligent enough to realise how dumb this statement is.
It's getting hit hard by ctrl+f, and it's going to get even worse as more automation sets in.
lawyers dont need to memorize the law since they can look everything up>being a (good) lawyer requires many talents; (i) social skills; (ii) creativity; (iii) oratory skills; (iv) retoric and writing skills (most people, including highly educated ones, cant write properly>one of the oldest (and most important) professions in the world (you really think 90% of the people out there could defens themselves properly in a court of law)>etc.Man you really are dumb.
If the glove donâ€™t fit, you must post shit!
common man thinks people can understand "the system"wew
