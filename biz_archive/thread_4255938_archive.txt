WHAT doe /biz/ think about Thai Lopez?
Social media marketing scam artist.
I mean, he's probably ok if your goal is to become the next Dan bilzerian, but if not his "methods" won't be much use to you
He's a faggot but he's good at making money so I respect him
he makes money by selling people his techniques to make money.>get fools like you to pay me money
I used to hate him but after seeing him on the h3h3 podcast and in a few other interviews where he's actually having a somewhat normal conversation he doesn't seem too bad.
Little bit preachy but I can't fault the guy for hustling.
Seems like the type who places extremely high value on outward appearance, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; sort of a "fake it 'til you make it" type thing.
Not sure if he's much of a role model or someone to try and mimic though, but who knows
