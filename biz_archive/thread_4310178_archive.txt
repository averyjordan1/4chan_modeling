>there are people on /biz/ who sold their alts at 80% loss to buy BTC at ATH and will now sell their BTC for BCH right before it crashes
may this song give them comfort https://youtu.be/hCC6ZhRS7sY
Because /biz/ are retards with ADHDThis whole board is FOMO
XDDD i did it for a second like a retard at 1580 and immediately it started crashing and i sold
/biz/ only buys after 200% increase then screams 400%.
It's simple, it always has been, do the opposite of /biz/.
Go against the grain.
Except Bancor, DO NOT buy Bancor.
