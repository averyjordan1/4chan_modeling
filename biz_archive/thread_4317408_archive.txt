IT WILL FALL BACK TO $1000SCREENCAP THIS,
Your fudding has no power here.
Hashing power is going to Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin will no longer be king.
I don't think you realise which group is behind this PND.
corecucks are getting desperate i see
nothing can stop Bitcoin Cash.Just watch and learn kidsScreencap this as well faggot
this reminds me of last august, but it's going to end differently this time, am i right?
yes, its all over for now, pump is over, trend is ony down, people selling their BCC bags, its still huge overvalued by this huge artificially pump
not /biz/ thats for sure.
This.
It didn't hard crash from being super pumped when it rose to .310 just minutes ago.
It bled out.
That means something.
It bounced to .280, then bled again, now .270 and it bleeds.
Dumbasses, SELL OR BAGHOLD FOREVER
No , but you can notice in the desperation of the posts that a lot of the people here bought at the ath and think that by scamming people on this board into buying bcc , it will give them the opportunity to off load their bags on a minimal loss.
I have never understood why so many people here work against each other as opposed to with each other.
I mean, it's not as if by fudding these few biz brothers, you're influencing the price on a high level
excactly.
This is all a big joke.
And we've been here before.
those who do not learn from the past, are doomed to repeat themselves
i'm sad I didn't catch that sweet BTC dip a couple of hours ago.
It's a coping mechanism it's fine
