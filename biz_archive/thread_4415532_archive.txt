/biz/ I realized something.
Unless I go for the ultimate risk and invest most of my savings into crypto what ever I make off of crypto is going to be less than just my salary.
I invested 5k in crypto (over the course of a few months), which is less than 1 month of my take home pay.
Honestly the market is too volatile for me to even consider putting much more than that in.
Even if I got in for the 7x of BTC I would be sitting on barely 35k, which isn't exactly impressive.
This just doesn't feel worth it.
>doesn't feel worth itCompared to what?
>even if I 7xdo you hear yourself?
what else can you put your 5K into that might 7X?
try putting in 40k -> 280k
Its sad but I feel the same way.However I am a sub $500 capital cuck
No risk, no gains.
You decide.
All in LINK
I'm not saying I'm going take it out of crypto.
However 7x is a thing of the past for the most part except for a few possible edge cases, which is what I have parked my money in for the future.
Day trading and chart watching is just high stress and for the most part hasn't been high reward for me.
Compared to the general stress the massive swings in the market and chart watching brings me.
I have 50k in index funds instead which honestly are a lot safer because shitcoins are in no way guaranteed to 7x.
tfw an extra 35K isn't "worth" it to tge same anon who makes 35K/yr
ok nancy
Again I'm not saying I'm taking my money out.
Just the risk vs. the reward of the entire thing collapsing, and the stress of watching charts, doesn't feel worth it.
Even the memes /biz/ produces aren't that great.
Don't overextend yourself but... put it this way: I wish I went 100% in btc when I made my first buy.
I'd be retired today.
Then don't day trade.
Put it in BTC, ETH and LTC and just hold forever.
Once you get that 7x, find something else hot and do it again.
It's a multiplication game, more you start with the more you have at the end.
My only regret is that I put just 10 percent of my savings into it at the start
