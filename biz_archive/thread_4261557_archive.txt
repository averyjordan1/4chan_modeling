This is such an excellent coin.
Literally my comfiest hodl
I'm still sitting from the ICOhttps://blog.0xproject.com/development-update-2-oct-2017-ced97688f236big BIG things coming
I'll just leave this here.
Also my comfiest hold.
Will buy more on the next dip.
Thinking of taking half my NULS stack when it's at $2.50.
Just hope 0x stays dips some before then.
