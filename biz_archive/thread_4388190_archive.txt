Can someone explain this?
It says I bought 25,000 Futures us dollars, it goes up 0.01% and now Ive gained fucking 250k???
Just cashout fast
wh-what did you u-use...?
Looks like a bug, you made 25,000 pennies if I'm reading it right
One contract is $1000 you bought 25000 so your open position is $25,000,000.
$25,000,000 * .01 = $250,000.
You should read the contract specs before you buy.
CASH OUT NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Futures work like options.
25,000 contracts actually cost 25,000 x 1000 = 25,000,000.
A one cent increase to your mark is 25,000,000 x 0.01 = 250,000 Now learn how to google shit and never come back here again.
I hate stupid fucks like you coming on here and ruining things that an easy 10 second search could fix.
for what its worth at least its not another bcash thread
fuck yeah
fuck i looked it said i put down 25 billion
