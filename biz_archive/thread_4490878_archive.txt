Get some Dash it's gonna be big for the weed industry.
Has that street-shitter Pajeet ever been wrong?
jokes/memes aside dash is up 500% since this past year.
you can look for yourself.
it's much closer to being digital cash than bitcoin or bitcoin cash is and actually is rolling out an ATM/point of sale system in almost every dispensary in america.
Loaded up last night.
Strapped in and ready for the DASHening.
Shit's going to moon so hard.
Teeka's super bullish on Dash, he even issued an Alert talking about it today.
tempting, but 500 a fucking coin seems absurd.
Especially when xmr is like 125.Granted there is no reason why it cant get to bcc levels
and yet /biz/ keeps calling it a shitcoin
it's obviously vert, both are green
I want to own this but I am not willing to sell my positions in BCH and ETH right now =/
Only stupid niggers buy into something solely based upon rumor.
