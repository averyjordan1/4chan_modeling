Like 6x on ethereum, 4x in DGB.
thats about it
50% on that xlm rocket last month.I could have gone 2x, but my emotions were running and I wasn't paying attention to the obviously significant resistance approaching (1k sats)
I went 25x on Ethereum and 20x on BTC.
Nothing else has come close.
Invested 5k in 2015.
6x was my peak.
Invested in shitcoins and now I'm only at 20k...
If I just left it in BTC I would have 30k.
Haha I'm -20% haha

3 fucking hours.
Best trade of my life next to buying DGB at 106 sats.Congrats, my man.
Not really you just had to buy like a year and a half ago
Biggest was Bitcoin Cash.
Bought at $350 and sold at $2000 per coin.
Could have held longer and sold at $2400 but eh, played it safe.
Figured $2000 was the barrier.
% in Ethereum.
Invested into GRS at 2200sats.
Saw the boom all the way to 20k sats.
Was too emotionally attached to it because the hipster inside "found it before it was cool".
I didn't sell until it dropped back to 11k.
Still nice gains.
Invested into SMARTCASH at 400sats.
Saw the boom all the way to 3000sats.
Never sold because I'm holding coins for smart rewards, selling at the peak would have lost my rewards (25% of stash in airdrop).
Never thought it would drop back down so low.
Lol.
Kinda a bad call on my part.
Been on some nice rocketships lately.
Anon, can you keep a secret?
Invest in factom.
Not bad!
My best was investing $500 in ELIXIR and turning it into $27,000.
Bought antshares below $10, BCH below $300 and LINK at ICO price.Also mined LTC when it was 0.2 btc back in 2013 - and sold for btc.
I bought ETH below $20 and have held until now, so that.
700% on ARK
Also going off what this guy said, I got about $50,000 or so for free in the ELIX airdrop, so there's something to be said for those.
Dude, I saw you post this story a couple months ago and decided to do the same thing you did.
I made 1,250 Eth addresses and registered them for the LGR airdrop (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2348732).
No kidding, you were my inspiration for this.
Bought 5k OMG at .80 cents
About 10x.
On DGB of all things.
This is going to make you guys sick but here goes.>bought 7.5 BTC at $450 and sold at $1300>bought 2000 ETH at $12 and sold at $13 >bought 2500 LTC at $3.89 and sold at $8>bought 1400 LTC at $33 and sold at $89>bought 19300 VTC at $.87 and sold at $5.20Those are my biggest gains in chronological order.
Here is my current holdings.
So far my biggest profits have come from VTC.
My next big play is BAT.
My biggest was a 3x on nulls.
I sold early, could have had a 6x.
Bought neo at $13Bought DNT when it was 600 sats, sold at 4000These came back to back in August after a year of fumbling around in which i only managed to turn 3k into 16k.
I am currently at 3480% return from a $12 investment in ripple.Everyday I resist the urge to kill myself
Bat will be huge.They literally just partnered with YouTube.
Guess people are too stupid to see how huge that is.
better than 10x and slowly bleeding it out
It gets better my friend>https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-ad-operation-used-to-steal-from-publishers-is-uncovered-1511290981?mg=prod/accounts-wsjThe normies are waking up.
I already use nothing but Brave.
x (ETH from 13 to 328) but I only bought $150 worth.
I stll have some, but I traded half of it for BTC last week at 7550.
Jesus 2000 ETH sold at 13With more patience you'd be a guaranteed millionaire in Q2 2018.
I don't get so scared anymore.
HOLDING is a lot easier now.
,- became 1400,- thanks to Digibyte dayswish i just held onto BTC after that
-200%
Currently +107% on my first BTC purchasetfw I only put in $80 at that time
chill opsy, u can get 40x ezzi with Icon ICX coming to market shortly.
Started (again) in Oct, Raiden ico was my best so far.
Snubbed here and everywhere else.
My second buy was a pharma company that studied some vaccine for some sickness.
Everyone was shitting on it.
Saw a news blip that said they would be holding a conference to showcase the vaccine.
"Boy, there's going to be a lot of people excited, I wonder what would happen if I went all in.
">only 1k in, just starting out>conference happens>wake up next morning after a really shitty week>holy fucking shit +487%I was hooked.
forgot to mention, stock was not even a dollar yet, then it jumped to $4 or $14...I forget.
x so far
around 600% returns on some etf over the last 30 years.. fortunately I wasntthe one who setup that mutual fund because that rate kind blows in all honesty.
Magic!
