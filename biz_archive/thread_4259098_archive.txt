Will SALT actually reach 25$?What actually stops from buying a fistful of tokens for like under 4$ and then get a loan of say 10000$ and pay back with just 400 SALT tokens?
yes
yes
Insider here.SALT will hit around $7 then crash.
Yes
whatâ€™s stopping me from getting a loan then paying back the loan?
SALT only pays off the interest, not the loan!For example, $100,000 loan for 1 year at 10% APR: You will pay $5,499.06 in total interest across the life of the loan assuming you are a good boy and pay every month.
That's either $5,499.06 dollars or 219.9624 SALT used to pay the interest.
Buying 219.9624 SALT right now at $3.70 would save you $4685.19 on interest payments on the loan.
well it's gone up a full dollar today
I have no idea how salt works or what it's really about, yet I own 17 of them

4259762It's only a part of the interest that can be paid with salt.
We don't know how much yet.
It will probably be a percentage.
Yes it only pays off the interest, however the loan rates wont be 10%.
Mark my words, we'll see 15-25% rates on average using the platform.There disparity between the current market price in Salt and buying through their platform will close once the trading goes live.
Pretty sure they said 2 percent max.
Quick rundown on loans can burgers get them or no fun allowed
Yup burgers can for sure get them
Isnt that basically nothing?
I'm hearing 25% of interest and then 5% of loan value
It was 20%
