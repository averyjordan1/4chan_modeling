Hmm, people were shilling Neo for like the past 5 days.
Now it drops, and BTC suddenly goes up....my theory about alts being used to pool money into BTC is probably right.
Have u looked at any other alt graph?
every alt dumps to shit when btc pumps
My point exactly.
It's not just Neo.
All of them are working with Satoshi.
They have an agreement.
It's all part of the plan.
That's because the graphs are "ALT/BTC".
The vertical axle is BTC value.
Of course when the alt goes horizontal and BTC pumps, the graph goes visually down.
>still up 33% from the last 3 daysStill comfy.
Just some people taking profits before the next mission.
But people when see red, they immiediately think it is dumping.
It is not.
It's just that the BTC in "ALT/BTC" result is lower.
Alts are a fucking joke at this point.
I'm stuck with a few bags and I know I'm never getting my BTC back
Buy the dip ya dip
JUST JUST JUST JUST JUST
don't worry, it'll stop @ $28, then i'll buy again, wait for $50+ and sell againi do that all the time, it's a way of earning money
