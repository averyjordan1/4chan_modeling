Ok, I've had enough.
I've been following this cryptocurrency scene for a little bit now and missed BTC in the past, ETH when it was bellow 1$ and now I fear I'm going to miss out on more.
I know FOMO is bad and I'm not degenerate like people on /biz/ that cry about their 50$.I've had enough and told myself that I'm going to save up 6k$ until February-March and then start trading cryptocurrencies.
I've had some basic daytrading lessons about logic behind patterns etc.. but that was in NASDAQ.Is there are good guide to trading Cryptocurrencies or is it better to research coins (their team, technology,..) and hold for them to moon.I don't know how many moon missions there really were, but I know some were successul.Please give me some tips, I have strill bankroll managment and understand risk taking, unlike some of the complete retards here.
I feel like I know nothing, but sometimes I read things here and almost sigh to myself how any of you can even trade.
No one knows what the news goldmine coin will be.
NO ONE.1) Use shit like this BCH farce to earn shorgains2) buy altcoins at low price and hold for high gainsPatience wins money.Also /biz/ is cancer.
Just play like you really want to lose money, thatâ€™s how you make money
Is there are good guide to trading Cryptocurrencies or is it better to research coins (their team, technology,..) and hold for them to moon.Flip a coin.
You will save a lot of time.
This seems fairly easy thing to do.
However, I fucking feel absolutely retarded, because I know little to nothing, yet it is almost too easy to be true.
So either I'm delusional or this is basically printing money, because as much as cryptocurrencies are volatile, the market on alt coins seems pretty fucking easy to long or short for 5-10% gains.
