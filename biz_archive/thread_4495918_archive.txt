So /biz/, what coin will go at least 10x until this year ends?My choice is INXT.
Opinions?
Bcpt
but why that recent dump?
REQ
x dont exist anymoreits now 3to5x
the only realistic x10 coi.
eoy i can think of is ETP
REQ, HST, MOD, FUCKIN WABIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Best case scenario;HST might get you 3-5xGVT maybe 7x
REQ and HST
confido is super cheap right not but once this legal issue is sorted out they will be right back up $2 eoy guaranteed, easy 200x
Let's see...HST price right now is $0.20.>They're gonna announce their partnership with the United Nations.>Cryptopia will list HST before the end of this month.
Binance and bittrex coming soon.>Market cap below $7m and circulating supply only 30m HST.With these formula, I'm optimistic HST will reach at least $1 by EOY.
That's a x5 from $0.20.
What goes down must come upWrong.
Arenâ€™t all these coins except REQ already mooning?
HST has just started mooning.The only downside of HST is that it lacks marketing, that's why it's under the radar.
But that's gonna change soon.Currently they are listed on ED, kucoin and livecoin.
Cryptopia will list HST before the end of this month.
Binance/bittrex probably in December.
shhh
Im convinced the only way to see that kind of gain is to be in before theres any sort of pump.I put my high-risk capital towards the Omanilla ICO.
Time will tell.
Unironically this
Powr if you bought in a week ago
LGD
DNA because it has a low market cap, actual use case, and is still around ICO price.
If COSS starts the move this year, that.
MODUM
