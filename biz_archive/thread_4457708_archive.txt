Binance literally just added the option to buy with USDT a few minutes ago.
Incoming massive pump.
Buy now, make up for the money you dum dums lost buying high on BCH
I doubt this is the big news.
This seems like Binance trying to capitalize on neo being in the spotlight and possible getting bigger news from them
Binance adding USDT options always has preceded pumps by a few hrs.
Happened with BCH, and ETH.
Probably because it makes it more normie friendly.
Kucoin added neo pares as well
everyone is going to sell the shit out of this.don't buy
He says hoping to buy a pre-moon dip
buying high on BCHso your suggestion is to buy NEO at a high?
