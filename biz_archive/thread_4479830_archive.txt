I'm priced in at $.094/bts.
Maybe I'll sell at $100, probably not though.
>that BTS/USDT pair
What do bitshares comprise of?
tl;dr BitShares is a Proof of Stake coin, decentralized browser wallet and exchange where smartcoins can be issued via smart contracts that are kept in the BTS network, smart coins are brought into existence by borrowing them from the network and locking at least 175% of their value in a BTS collateral (that you can get back when you pay your debt by shortselling)
If you buy shitshares you deserve what's coming to you /biz/
 up over 300% in last 4 weeksinsane profits?
