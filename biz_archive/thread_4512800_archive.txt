is this the next 100x we've been waiting for?
overhyped
Yeah overhyped... 11m market cap.. a working product.. a highly needed business in China due to counterfeiting.
Herpderp.. this will be 100m cap a week after ICO.
It will be 500m by March next year.
Don't buy and stay poor.
Don't jinx it.
This will be the next DRP lol
Yes, ribbit
Itâ€™s a maybe.
We will see
Hype is never a bad thing in crypto.
If anything, it's the opposite.You're just jelly 'cause you didn't make it into the whitelist.
