Hey dumb dumb.
The only good time to buy buttcoin is yesterday.
Investment funds are moving into crypto.
What do you think buttcoin will be going for by the end of next year?
You're never going to be happy with what you paid for it.
Seems like it cant go much higher>"Uh this new internet money is at 1$ im sure its not worth to invest in anymore" Literally me in 2010.
Seems like it can't go much higherThen why the fuck would you buy it?
same here anon, but who could predict that this will reach 7000$ in 2017 and 700.000$ in 2020
