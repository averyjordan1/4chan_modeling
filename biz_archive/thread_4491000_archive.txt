now post the enron, or lehman chart
We're comparing bitcoin to tech companies with working products... ok
Its all inflation, if measure sp500 or dowi in gold it hasnt gone up since 2000
well done OP u found the internet bubble.
what’s ur point?
Everyone knows we’ve got a few years before crypto bursts yet.
This is 1995, remember
Apple had not released the iPod by the end of 2000.
The iPhone was released seven years later.They were only selling fucking iMacs back then!!
!Amazon in 2000 was still selling mostly only booksand didn't even have eBooks or an eBook reader.Nor did it have a used book affiliate program.No doubt today all the FANGs along with pretty much all the tech space and web media are in a huge bubble.But not all of it is bullshit.they actually did make stuff that changed stuff once upon a time.
That is why i think bitcoin will rise constantly and not correct to 3500 or whatever people say.. there are markets that don`t correct to a 'normal' curve
Even if bitcoin doesn't produce anything... it's popularity will rise the same apple and amazon were
When the bubble burst, so many companies died

kek.
Bitcoin literally only exists so you can buy high and sell it someone else for higher.
Greater fool theory.
Doesn't mean there isn't money to be made.
Whenever someone questions the legitimacy of bitcoin, someone will immediately point to the price and say "SEE IT WENT UP".
Guess what?
So is fucking bitconnect.
And you make x10 the gains on bitconnect compared to bitcoin.
By this logic Bitconnect is the valuable fucking asset on earth.
The price doesn't control the value of the asset.
The value controls the price.
I honestly think it wont go under 6000 in a long time
so did*
