According to the TokenCard Discord channel TokenCard will support ETH ERC20 BTC and ZEC!
So TokenCard should be the first ZCash Debitcard on the Market.
If this does not pump the price i dont know what will.
how pathetic
?
top kek, implying anyone gives a shit about ZCash... What will pump the price is an actual visa deal or a working product or EVEN A WORKING APP ;^)
Visa: https://medium.com/monolithstudio/wavecrest-partnership-announcement-733a8e6e5554Working App and Visa in the Pic.
Release is Q4 2017
May 24AND STILL NOT A FUCKING APP RELEASED 1 WEEK FROM DECEMBERHow can you have faith in this team?
you fucking moonboy, good tech and real product development takes time, most of the time there are setbacks , if you wanna be hyped from a hollow project go wank yourself at tweeter or something.
Because Peter Vessenes and https://newalchemy.io/ is developing the App.December will be great.
Also PR starts then.
