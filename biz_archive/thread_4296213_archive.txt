You shills have convinced me, I'm so confused where to buy tho, there are so many exchanges.
Which has the lowest fees?
And if I were to buy alt coins, do I need a separate wallet for all my coins?
(Even the shit coins?)

coinbase is easy.
1.
Put money in a bank acct.2.
Give coinbase ur bank info.3.
Wait a couple days for them to deposit a few cents in ur acct and confirm your acct.
4.
Buy some coins and then u can transfer them to any exchange or wallet.
Shapeshift or bittrex both are goodyou can keep coins on exchange unless you have huge amounts I would advice a hard wallet
How do you cashout from Coinbase?
Buy ETH and transfer to hitbtc.com, cheap fees tooYou don't need to verify unless for large transactions and they have an ETH/BCH pair so you don't need to fuck around with BTC at all.
Yes buy high sell low good job!
wire transfer; you have to pick your bank or input your routing information and account number, then it verifies through 2 sub $1 deposits
I have some bitcoin from 3 years ago..
I used to use coin.mx but it turns out that died.So let's say I bought some Ark last week and decide to sell it next week.
I can do that on coinbase?
What's *their* cut?
