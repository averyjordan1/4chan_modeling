Yeah I was retarded earlier too and didn't put a stop loss on mtl then freaked sold at 500 just kick me out of crypto already
when the fuck will people learn that that bald fuck is the big whale in the Palm Beach Confidential ''pump and dump'' group?
?When you read about it, its already too late to get in.
there are guarenteed stop-losses
Seriously how can you not see this pump and dump group for what it is?They say buy up $600 when the coin was around $450.
They obvious will dump before 600
