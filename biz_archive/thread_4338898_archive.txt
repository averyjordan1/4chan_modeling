During last days, markets' wallets are being filled with BTC e.g.
Bittrex 7394 -> 23653, see proofs below, check other markets yourselfhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/Bittrex.comhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/Bittrex.com?page=200However, BTC have been growing over USD and coins.
Seems like dumpers' strategy is following:* buy many BTC and send them to markets* while waiting for BTC to arrive (as you know, transaction queue stuck), keep other coins low* once all BTC are received by markets, start buying major coins, mainly BCH.Look at the pic from Poloniex moments ago: clearly BCH rate is being held artificially.Does it sound legit?
