BCH money pouring into NEO for failure to topple BTC.

hi china
What will happen when Wanchain release ?
Neo isn't the only good china coin ( I own both )
how is Tether not pumping with all that volume?
this
my FOMO is strong but im pretty sure it will dip exactly when I buyGuys tell me not to do this, please
print more to inflate
Hmmh, when to sell?
I now have 65% gains on NEO and FOMO on selling.
Yet there are a lot of stuff going to happen with NEO still before EOY
Keep switching between BCH and NEO for max gains
tether is "tethered" to a price of exactly $1theoretically each one is backed by bitfinex (I think) for 1$ Fiat - although its probably just a massive debt to themselves
there's no "probably" about it, it's certainbitfinex will go insolvent at some point in the near future and we'll witness the next MtGox.
Shit's going to suck for BTC and crypto as a whole.
When it happens we'll see BTC drop from whatever price it's at, say $12000 at that point, to like $2000 instantly and destroy virtually all market confidence
It's backed by absolutely nothing.
Once the public realizes tether has been printing their own money ad nauseum, shit will really hit the fan.
no thanks
but i'd love o slurp up those BTC when it happens
BCH is listed on Nasdaq.
NEO isn't That's it.www.nasdaq.com/symbol/bch
it's getting difficult to hold NEO down
people don't really care if tether act the same way as the real US dollar(printing more), this is what you get for creating a virtual dollar.
yeah bank of chile is what everyone FOMOd into
wasting you time posting that shitKys
Holy shit, I'm finally not getting justed anymore.
Please don't fuck up again Neo.

Never sell my NEO
Not too late at all.
We've got a lot of runway in front of us.
It will steadily rise until the news come out.
By then it's either moon or dump
