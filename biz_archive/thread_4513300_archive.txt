Alright you fags which ico is the next POWR?
I got 5 btc to dump
NULS.
Binance manipulation contest ends soon and new site incoming.>in b4 buh duh hello world githubIt's been updated and is legit.
contest ended
QSP
but yeah NULS is gonna have that day where you're just gonna see its gone up 400% and you'll question all you're life choices up to that moment if you don't go all in soon.
Damn, you're right.
Still a couple days until the prizes get distributed though.
Brother, you need to buy GVT.Look at the credentials.Look at the technicals.It's a clear at least 8-12x.
POWRwe're just getting started
HST
Do you know what ico means?
Nuls is obviously a total scam.
The website is atrocious, it's like they didn't even try to look serious.
The whitepaper looks like it was thrown together in one day.
It's 11 pages of triple spaced two-sentence paragraphs.
5 of those pages are the table of contents and redundant filler.
Honestly, HST.I can see it goes at least x4 to $1 by EOY.
Market cap below $9m.
Circulating supply 30m HST.
Team based in Melbourne, second ICO from Australia after POWR.And don't forget their possible partnership with the United Nations 
Idk why the chinks do this either.
But ANS,WTC, and ETP all had shady starts.
These issues will be resolved sooner rather than later.
Binance and bit-z would not list a blatant scam
Medicalchain.
