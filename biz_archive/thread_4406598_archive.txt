This is bullshit.
btc profits have to go somewhere.
Sweet I'm all in ETH, BTC is gonna dump in my sleep and I know it, it's already going down.
This may happen only if tonight BTC crash to 1500.So, try to make money out of this BTC rally like evey other fag here.
Ltc pls :(
Got both comfy
how?all in BCH when flippening occurs because fork falls through?
agreed OP, BTC got close enough to 8k like most predicted and its starting to dump...profits sinking back into ETH and some alts tonight and into the morning
Christmas presents most likely.I was shitposting.If BTC crash of course most of the money will go to FIAT/BCH/ETH/ALTS in this order but it needs to crash really hard to see ETH at 0,25.As you can see, BTC is trying to go to $8000 but won't break that resistance, once they realize it, whales will dump.
