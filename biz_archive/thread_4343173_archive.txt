what do you think about this is the medium-long term - 6 months and beyond?seems like the best privacy coin in terms of tech.
monero is more widely used but zcash is still a good option.
i'm guessing the recent increase is due to monero's rise and people wanting to diversify into relatively safe coins after the btc/bch fiasco
Useless garbage kike scam
it's useless because monero is #1 privacy coin and it will always be.
All the darkmarkets accept Monero and not.
Zcash or verge or I dont care what kind of shitcoin

3,691 Zcash is the opposite of not accepting Zcash.>privacy coin>knows exactly how many coins were seized
I've also heard Zcash is privately held by a company.
I mean for a lot of coins that's fine but for a privacy coin.
.... nah
3691 zcash>unknown amount of monero
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ZECBTC/ISPnilmb-ZECBTC/any opinions on this?
So you are saying feds could have 99% of the Monero supply?
Scary
they dont have even close to 99%, alphabay payments were mainly in BTC
You should look into Komodo Platform, a zCash fork.
Basically the ability to choose zCash privacy/anonymity, that functions as a platform/ecosystem like ETH, but without the ETH drawbacks.
They are polishing up the GUI for their atomic swap/electrum server decentralized exchange (BarterDEX, no need to download blockchain for atomic swaps!)
that will benefit most cryptos that aren’t Ethereum.Yes it will even support Monero once they develop the necessary code.
I paid my /biz/ dues by mentioning Monero in my post, so please don’t hate.
Oh yea!
Link is pretty cool too.
But... they COULD.NOBODY KNOWS how much Monero they have because Monero is the most perfect privacy coin/tech in the world developed by extradimensional DMT machine-elves, sooo...FML the Feds could have anywhere from .00001% to 99% of the supply of Monero?
!SELL SELL SELL SELL
I just realized your pic related is some photoshopped shit-show.
The start of the second page talking about unknown amount of Monero isn’t even a continuation of the first page.
Is this how Monerobros work?
Fucking liars.
Here I was starting to believe your shilling.
Almost got me!
Oh wait it is.
Fuck I should concentrate on work
