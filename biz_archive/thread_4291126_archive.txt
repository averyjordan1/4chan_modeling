/pol/ here, why is bitcoin crashing?
I remember reading somewhere that you should always buy after a crash.

Bitcoin is worthless.
There been a war going on since august the 1st between (((Blockstream))) and the big blockers.
I've been out of bitcoin since then and am all in alts until there's a clear winner.
Bitcoin could potentially die, then Bitcoin Cash could regain the name Bitcoin.
Except the fact that each is worth $6500.
That's the price after it has crashed hard.

/10 face not perfectly symmetrical.
Supply and demand determines values, not your personal opinions.
Deal with it.
Also Google "store of value".
We told you to leave last night.
Why did you come back?

But if you decide to hold BTC forever you will be worse off for it.
