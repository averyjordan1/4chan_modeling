Pretty good.
1h Ichimoku looking good, went under the baseline and it seems it's gonna go above it again which is a bullish sign
missed this boat...had my fringer on a 10k buy order when it was 0.58$....
Going all in powerFuck it
if this picture doesnt make you want to buy Vert you are probably a homosexual
Actually bought Vert because of that picture
I bought but not because of that picture.Is 20usd eoy realistic for this coin?

thisfucking weeaboo loser
alpha, you'll make it anon-kunits not unrealistict.
homosexyikes, someone didnt buy vertpic related is for (you) and 
Yeah.
Youâ€™re looking at $6-10.
this video captures my mood perfectly
after this bitcoin shitshow is overall PoW coins are done for
I'm basically married to Vert because I believe in this coin but I have to tell you that I'm a bit disappointed with its performance during this fiasco.
I expected it to overperform the market but so far it has underperformed.
It need to get listed on more exchanges.
What makes you think that?
Do you really think the majority of investors even care if the coin is PoW or PoS or whatever?
And how exactly does PoS solve the centralization problem when the big guys will still hold the most coins and thus collect the most rewards?
its harder to kill the chain with PoSalso PoW uses A LOT more electric powerPoS is just amount of rewards you get depends on how much you havethe network can still be lightning fast
I AGREE THATS WHY I ADDED VERT AND ETH TO MY PORTFOLIO.
