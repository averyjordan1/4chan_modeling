LOL
Basically, if you see Reddit shilling it, do the opposite.I held BTC (and bought more) throughout this shitshow.
Good riddance chinkcoin.
FUCK OFF COREE SHILL
What happened to the (((( flippening )))) guys?
Where are you guys?
Tell me what's going on please, assuming you haven't killed yourselves lmao
The quintessential pump and dump graph.
Pic related is what's going happen.
Screencap this,
Epic.
Simply epic.
I'm still here and you really have to use the meme right.
Blockstream are the kikes.
I'm guessing most have fucked off or panic sold.
I never expected this to happen in a day let alone us go over 1k before the fork.
You're a fool to even consider this being over.
what am i supposed to gather from this OP?i wondering if i should buy in again.
I've made a lot of money in the last 2 days holding BCC for just a few hours.scared its a dead cat bouncing
This is happening much faster than expected...
I hope it remains down for the day and btc rises so I can get better positioning.
My first reaction to 2400+ was this isn't possibly sustainable mainly because btcs price wasn't going down at the same rate.
When I woke up and saw a fucking $2700 tag in blockfolio, I laughed out loud from pain.
I'm guessing it had to be a big whale there's no way that was regular money.
This is literally in crash mode bruh.
Stereotypical pnd that FOMO bizfags and plebbitors fall for every time and get dumped on.
It'll wave until the chinks wake up in a few hours and then it'll freefall.
mess with the best, die like the rest
