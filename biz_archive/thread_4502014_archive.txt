This one is starting to rise more than the others.
It's the only one that has real privacy.
Otherwise, you're exposing your entire balance and payment history for every transaction.
Monero is untraceable by transaction or address, and people are only just starting to learn this.
Fucking newcoiner scum still think Bitcoin and Eth are private, when I have found whales following what money from what account went to what ICO, and that's not even difficult
Stoooop what i have can't even be considered bags yet
Monero will drop now that burgers are awake, they dump anything that isnt btc or an ICO
IOTA will overtake Litecoin and DASH at the first quarter of 2018.
LOL
