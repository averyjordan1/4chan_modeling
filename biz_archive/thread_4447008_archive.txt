Shalom,The goyim have discovered our subversive ways and we run an exit pump tonight to exit all BTC and related USDT markets.
Dont get caught holding BTC/USDT tomorrow.
We shall resume crypto trading after observing 7 days of rest.
We will accumulate cheap altcoins from the panicking gentiles and resume with our money making activities.
Praise Yahweh!t.
Rabbi Eli Silberbaum
Eat shit and die you miserable and pathetic racist bastard.
kek, just don't hold tether and your done.
Tether is stupid anyways.
Oy vey, the goyim know!
Shalim shlekem
Listen here you non-believer, you will FOMO into Bitcoin and be left holding bags.
Wisen up goy
