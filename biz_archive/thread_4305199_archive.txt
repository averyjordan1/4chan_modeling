What happend to odn do you remember?
Right out the gates almost we were mooning.
The fudd just got stronger and stronger trying to keep it down.
Going at great lengths to even fake slack screenshots.
These whales got it under a dollar... they got it under 50 cents.
And now are trying to accumulate even moar under 25 cents.
By the time this thing hits 1$ again it will shortly go to $3I've been in whale groups long enough to know how to fudd and accumulate for cheap.
>If you're a regular /biz Anon ask yourself this, what purpose does it serve to fudd?
There was no scam, no funny business, no overhyped or broken promises.
This project is one of the few gold mines out here and you haven't bought in at a sub 10 million market cap.
You wanna know how people make 10-20x gains on this board?
It's buying into projects like obsidian this early and this cheap.
>buy>hold>stakeIt's that easyBe warned
It's like you telling them to place buy orders, so you could come and dump your own bag to them.
You don't come on /biz/ to give people money, you come to /biz/ take their money away.
/biz/ get cautious when force majeure is gonna happen and everybody will lose their money.
That's when /biz/ helps.
Everything else is just jews.
Like not long ago, one faggot created ico (token or something) on coindesk and chose existing 3 letter name, what do you know?
insta 10M pump in old existing coin.
People are stupid.
It was just misunderstanding.
Now imagine how much you can achieve with coordinated shilling.
