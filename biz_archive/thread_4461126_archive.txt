Any thoughts or information on this token?
shit coin
reasons??
I'm in.
Crypto funds are going to be huge and ASTRO is my favorite out of the bunch.They are going to burn or airdrop some tokens in the next couple of weeks, and pay the first dividend in December.
Personally I don't have the time/energy/autism to research every single token with enough due diligence.
Holding ASTRO gives me exposure to all of the tokens I otherwise would have missed.
I also like the idea of having some pros managing entry/exit points, which is something I (and a lot of others) struggle with.
I've missed out on a lot of profit because I was greedy when it came to taking profits.Short term: Hold until after first dividend (~4 weeks)Long term: Hold to benefit from 'rising tide' of crypto with exposure to a range of coins.Disclosure: I FOMOd into this last week because the sell walls were so thin.
Buying more today to reduce my average price.
Thanks man, this is exactly the type of response I wanted.
I also FOMOd earlier in the week but I'm doing the same.
Picolo Research are the people who run the investments, and if you look at their track record of ico reports, they're pretty spot on.
Not to mention the fact that they are able to get into presales and other shit that requires connections and huge amounts of capital.
Their app launches Dec 1st.First dividends paid before EOY.Undervalued atm.
My bags are filled.
Going up a bit at the moment
