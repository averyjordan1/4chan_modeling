Why should I move all my Alts to btc if once the btc pump ends my alts will receive that same % btc got?What are the chances of btc hitting 20% gains in 1 day vs alts?
what are the chances as BTC rises day on day vs your alts you reach a point where you give up on them and jump on BTC at a loss.>pro tip highly fucking likely
Kinda annoying that as soon as btc rises my alts go down.Can't believe the entire market does that.
Doesn't make too much sense to me.
at least it's stopped smashing the shit out of alts when it falls, for now anyway
