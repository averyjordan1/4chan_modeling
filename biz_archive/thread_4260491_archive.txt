Hey /biz/, I'm looking to invest in some materials and commodity trading stocks.
Does anyone know any good public traders that are relatively cheap stock?
Mainly I'm looking at those who deal in graphite and rare earths, as I believe those to be the next generation of hot commodities.Also, /commodity/ general I suppose.
Pic for the most part unrelated.
