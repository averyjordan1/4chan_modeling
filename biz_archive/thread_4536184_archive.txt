I picked good coins too but either sold too early or sold too late.
I hate myself.
If I should have just hold BTC I'd have better gains>sold ANS(NEO) at 7 dollars>sold XMR at 45 dollars>sold ARK at 35 cents>sold OMG at 8 dollars>held LINK after SIBOS>held AST after the ICOJ U S TUST
I'm down in satoshis but even in $
Oh and a more recent one, >bought POWR at 3500 sat and sold at 3670 sats
