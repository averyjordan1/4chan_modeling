for all you faggots who haven't gotten in you'll have a chance for a few hours to buy below 1$ until the next AMA when they are going to reveal their partnerships
people need to sell to up their volume for this contest :^)
>ITTRetardsDid you think that it was going up like crazy for a whole week?>We will rank users from 1 to 100 in terms of the total NULS volume traded on your account (includes both buys & sells) during the competition period.
both buys & SELLSThat guy that dropped at midnight UTC is already at the first place.Hahahahahahah, fucking genius.You should expect a fucking week of massive manipulation swing trading it like a crazy buying and selling with the price pretty much stagnant.
You would be fucked if you try to trade too if you have no idea of what you're doing.The best part is that if you dump too now you get points for the contest.
lol
