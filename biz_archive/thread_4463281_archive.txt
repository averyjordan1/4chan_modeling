 BTC sell order at a bit over 8kWhat do lads
Poo in it
That 30M tether is buying up BTC right now, no doubt.
146 BTC sell order CREATED BY THE EXCHANGE ITSELF.30 MILLION TETHERS CREATED OUT OF THIN AIR.Man this is the best scam of the 21st century once it becomes unveiled.
bitcoin, which is limited in 21 million units, it's the scam, and not the currency which tether is based upon, which allows for fraction reserve, surely bitcoin will crash and not the currencies that allow for unlimited fake units, yees!
i feel so safe holding USD
