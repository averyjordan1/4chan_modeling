linking to the most censored crypto sub ever.
Fuck off you normie.
Tether conspiracy is my favourite crypto meme.
646 Million>Out of 130 BILLIONWew it's fucking nothing.
remember though the price of crypto can be pumped up from comparatively little volume, and market cap is practically meaningless.
Mad bitchcoin bagholder now trying to smear shit everywhere.
Kys.
They haven't even entered the market in significant numbers yet.
Let this shit run for another 1 or 2 years and then dump on them.
True.
Just because the market cap is 130 billion doesn't mean there's actually 130 billion dollars sitting somewhere waiting to be redeemed.
It's an imaginary number that's just price * total shares.
The price can be pumped just by burning through sell walls on an exchange.
Wew it's fucking nothing.this money is used to short squeeze with margins not to buy actual bitcoinsbut this inflates the price without influx of real cashfor example if too many people decide to cash out at 10k (it's a magical round number and also 10x from beginning of the year, so it will happen) real exchanges wouldn't be able to fulfill demand
wait do you genuinely not think /r/bitcoin is shitit's literally just a BCH shill subreddit that is controlled by the BCH devs and heavily censoredliterally any other forum is better, /r/btc, /r/cryptocurrency, bitcointalk, hell literally a discord server with 10 people in it is better than /r/bitcoin
>https://twitter.com/BitfinexedThis guy has been wrong so many times its hilarious
holyshit you're fucking dumb I don't even want to explain
>mfw all money you have invested you can afford to loose>mfw i only hold some handpicked alts >mfw i dont give two shits about btc anymoreeven if the whole market collapses i dont even care anymore its just silly at this point
It has come to my attention that BTC is being propped up by a fiat coin that has no value.Recommendation: Withdraw all your shit from Bitfinex now.
Hillary meme attempts are cringy as fuckThe left can't meme
Uhh I profitted heavily from trading BTC to BCH.
I traded it while it was $550 each, I'm more than double where I was.
BCH at the peak reached $2800, that peak will be reached again.
If I stayed BTC I would have gained $1000 from $7000 to $8000, but I gained from $300 to $2800 because of all the BTC noobs dumping.>BTC noobs don't know that BCH is just as rare as BTC, and in fact you need BTC to get any BCH, so it is basically buying BTC but for much cheaper
This guy has been wrong so many times its hilariousfucking ignoramus logic>if it haven't happened yet it will never happen hurr durri remember people like you were denying obvious china ban right until it fucking happened
I'm confused.
if r/bitcoin is censored and shilled by BCH, why the fuck would they thread proving the tether issue is not going to affect BTC?
r/bitcoin is not censored or shilled by BCH, where is that logic coming from?
In fact if you mention BCH in there, you will get instabannedr/btc is the BCH subreddit, they have taken over it because r/bitcoin bans too many people, so BCH holders conglomerate in r/BTC and it is basically an entirely BCH sub which is cool I love BCH

Nice /biz/ tier post mate.
Hope you get cucked when the tether bubble pops
B-B-But anon remember that it is all about liquidity>All about margin>I too can 10x the market cap with strategically injected 600MIgnore the tether conspiracy theorist, they all have an agenda.
Or they are just butthurt becuase they lost money.
Yeah that would be your dream huh?
Then you would finally get your 10 minutes of twitter fame.Even if it all was a bubble, the only reason you would want it to pop now is if you are a mad nocoiner who lost money
maybe it isn't about what anyone wants, but what the truth is
Meh doesn't worry me I don't use bitfinex or tether.
4417283this guy is just an assblasted faggot that sold at $1000https://amp.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ypy58/the_truth_about_bitfinex_and_tether/
No i dont want to pass the capital gainz bracket and haev to pay like 20%It's 0% if you made less than 37k in the yearThis is an IRS conspiracy to make good goys cash out more before year end so the jews can rape you
