Holding your money in government fiat at this point in time is really dumb.
Holding it all in crypto is a bit less dumb.Silver and gold is probably a better alternative to weather the storm if you want low risk.Fucking central banks and their money printing frenzy.
The inflation is sky high but it isn't visible in anything but real unmanipulated assets like cryptos.
