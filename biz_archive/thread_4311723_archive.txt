How much do you have in ETH?
I got 4.5... bought at the 300 mark... feeling comfy but a bit nervous... you see, those 1.350 dollars are like a whole monthly salary for me.
Any recommendations?
What do you think of OMG?
ETC is more comfy.
I'm up 50% today while avoiding the bitcoin bullshit.
would you mind sparing some ETH good sire?
M-m-me
Ethereum Classic?
I've been mining eth for a while, it's a ride from 285-350 back and forth
Eth Classic is mooning like fuck too lol, you guys better watch out
Usually I'd say diversify but at the moment I think your safest bet is to hold.
The crypto market is always volatile but at the moment it's just TOO volatile.
ETH hasn't had its time in the sun for a while so if you can wait it out I'd just hold on for dear life.
It's when you start branching out to other coins that things can get a bit wonky and go awry.
Long story short, if you're really worried about losing your money just hold.
ETH is relatively stable these days.
Also check out decred guys.
Apparently, they're going to activate lightning network late November/early December.
4311891Thank you.Also, onyone here has an opinion on OMG?
comfyare you fucking dumb?do you realize how much uncertainty this BCH bullshit is causing?
you think it won't bring down the entire market with it?
It will, but ETH will stay on 300, since that's home
