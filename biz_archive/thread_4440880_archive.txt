reminder that youre not redpilled if youre trying to pay off low interest loans

Reminder that you're not redpilled if you in debt.
Not really though because I doubt you're accounting inflation too.
In order for that to be profitable you need to be getting a pretty decent return on the money you're investing.
How low is low interest?
I have no idea what the rates are because I've never taken a loan.
Are the mortgage tier or credit card tier?Either way even if mortgage tier let's say 4%, tack on another 3% inflation rate, you're getting 7%.
That's about what an index fund will do, you're breaking even here
Inflation works in your favor when in debt
lmfao debt is literally how every large business makes all of its money.
Debt is an investment if you aren't retarded debt can make you rich.
In the US, subsidized loans don't accrue until 6 months after graduation or dropping out.
Unsubsidized accrues immediately, but IIRC both are 4.45%.
A young college student with literally no property, no credit, no income will not see something that good in a long time.
