Are there ever any threads on actual investing here?
not including baseless crypto speculation
I don't get pic related.
Not sure if there's anything to understand tho.Anyway, I feel like I'm investing when I'm buying undervalued project coins/tokens
you're going to be kicking yourself down the line when you realize the gains you've missed out on.
But anyway investing is such a broad topic, instead of bitching, next time start a thread on a specific investment vehicle you're interested in.Because you are investing.
For an investment to be undervalued you have to determine it's value before hand so you can compare if the actual price is above or below that.
It looks like everybody here is just buying or selling based on their gut and not caring about what it actually costs.
I bought into the efficient market hypothesis a while ago, which I guess is pretty boring compared to crypto speculation, but I'm happy with my returns.It just strikes me as odd that this board is all crypto and nothing else.
There aren't even any threads about chasing alpha or looking for arbitrage which is what I would have guessed would be popular here.
