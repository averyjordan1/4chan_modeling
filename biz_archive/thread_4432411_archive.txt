>cryptos you bought because of posts on /biz/Ones I made money on: pivx, LINK, arkLost money on:Stratis, I should have known better than to buy a crypto with a dev that was a nigger.
ARK, Up 600-700% depending on market fluctuations

ETPMade biggest profits so for with like x2.5 gains>LINKMade ok profit, would have made >x2 if wasn't greedy.>NULSBig loss so far, would have been decent profit if sold during pump instead of holding.>ODN Minor loss, should have been x2 gain but greedy again hold too long>ELIXTiny profit cos bought near ATH but sold before crash>COSSMade a bit over 2x profit selling at ATHThink that's it for shit I've bought after first seeing shilled here.
buy anything.
everything has gone up from the past.
you could have bought anything and be in the green, the difference will be exactly how much you make.things wont be like this forever.
just buy something and hold it for awhile.
ETHMade a ton>LINKBought the presale, made a bit over 2x.
Wish I sold the peak.>DGBBought at 144 sats and sold at 400 sats.
Missed the whole run up to 2000 sats, but made a good profit>WTCOnce again, sold too early.
Bought at 0.50, sold at $2.>NEOMade a ton buying around $4, sold most around $40 or so.
Should have bought back in.
its a coin flip sometimes i make 100% gain with 4chan.
sometimes i make 30% gains.
>ETHmade 93K off of a 7 grand investment.
I thank /biz/ every day for this since they were shilling it before even Reddit.>Linkdown from 6 grand investment to around $2500.
Still believe it will earn me way more then ETH sometime next year.
>ETH shilled last Fall>ignored it, lost the opportunity>FOMO at $80, still made money.
>SC shilled in April at $0.002>Buy in, ride the wave up to $0.02 and 10x my investment>Keep holding and it dumps, back down to $.004I've watched other anons get seriously cucked though, like with DGB and RDD
2011>told to check out Tor >discover BitcoinMore or less some random guy led me on the path to my preposterous gains.
Also I was told to buy Tesla at $25 and I did.
On the other hand I was told to buy MDDD during the 3D printer tech race, and it has flopped lost like $300 on that one.
I want to plug a stock, the company just developed a drug that works like Viagra for women the drug is Rekynda and the company is Palatin Technologies.
Ticker: PTN.
Trading at about $0.80 a share, market cap of $135 million.
/biz/ told me to buy ETH.
Made a lot of money./biz/ told me to buy Kyber ICO.
Made a ton of money.....that's about it..Oh yeah /biz/ told me to buy NEO, but I bought pretty late and made a little bit of money (bought around $22).
The ETH call was when ETH was rising from $20 to $50 though.
I still haven't sold it because I missed the peak so I need it to go back up again basically.
LINK - lostEBET - made 10%BCH - lostCFD - lostASTRO - lostNEO - lost (so far)A lot of losing, but overall I'm still up thanks to my BTC holdings more than covering the rest.
Fuck you, nigger.
I'm grateful to /biz/ for teaching me to distinguish between pajeets and decent advice.
Reddit is a useful source, but I get most of my information here... and have for a long time.
Here's some more spacing to fit your spacing meme expectations.
Now go an hero, faggot.
RekyndaInteresting on Bremelanotide, seems like they're still pending FDA approval and are in the new drug application phase.Strong clinical trial results, though & on demand injectable which implies relatively low shelf-life after first use (likely to translate into sustainable revenue model on refill rx)....https://www.palatin.com/assets/BMT-Licensing-Summary-Overview-31Oct2016-1.pdf

I've only been doing this for a few months.
/biz/ has been more helpful than not.
These are not all of the coins I own/owned but these are the ones that I think /biz/ had an impact on my decision to buy or sell.>SIGTFirst altcoin, didn't realize how fucking risky this shit really was in the grand scheme of things since I was a complete newfag.
I was up 4x at one point and can't believe I didn't sell looking back on it.
Was lucky to get out with a tiny profit in the end.
What a disaster this coin was.>OMGGot in late, made tiny profits.>NEOGot in way late, still bagholding but not too upset about it.>LINKJust made a tiny investment here just to be a part of the memes.>NEBLCan't remember if it was here or somewhere else but I got in on this and took huge profits.>MOD, REQDown a small amount but not upset about holding.
Signatum.
Took an 80% loss on it.
I don;t blame /biz/ though, it was too risky and I didn't do due diligence.Currently all in on Monero.
It's the only coin I trust.
I literally don't understand how Ark or the other popular altcoins are anything other than PnD attempts.
I want to plug a stock, the company just developed a drug that works like Viagra for women the drug is Rekynda and the company is Palatin Technologies.
Ticker: PTN.
Trading at about $0.80 a share, market cap of $135 million.It seems like a decent company but God damn has their stock taken a beating since the 90's, and hasn't really recovered.Also I don't like that they don't pay dividends.
Admittedly I get this from Kevin o'Leary, but he strongly advises to never buy stocks that don't pay dividends as that's where 70% of profits made in the stock market has been made over the last few decades.What makes you think that this female viagra thing will catch on commercially?
Antshares was my biggest winner among the /biz/ shilled meme coins.
Made over 100k from it.Also got into OMG, WTC, bitcoin cash, and chainlink presale but only got small gains from them because I sold way too early or too late.Currently bagholding req and mod.
Fairly sure at least one of those will moon sometime in the next few months.
