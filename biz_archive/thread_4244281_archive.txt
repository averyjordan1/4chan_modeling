BTC dip when?It's been too long, when is bitcoin crashing.
I've been waiting for too long.
You missed that downright apocalyptic 500-600 crash?
That was it.
Bitcoin is doomed because it is now only a couple hundred below the all time high.
It might "crash" after the fork but it won't last for long.
Yesterday
I just want to buy the dip, also a 400-500 dip is nothing, I want a bigtime, major league crash, in the thousands.
Man I fucking love crypto.
