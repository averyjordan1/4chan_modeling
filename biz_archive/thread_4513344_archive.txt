I'm not going to give you any more shit.
I don't enjoy messing with people.
I'm just saying, you can't be bewildered and upset and throw shit at people when they don't like you.
That's not how the real world works.
Hate me all you want, make fun of me all you want, that's cool.
I don't care... but it's not productive.
Turn your angst into something productive.
Hate me for not liking you?
Short Firstblood, make some money, call me a mean name.
That's way more productive than making fun of my Twitter page.But in general, have a nice night and best of luck w/ whatever you settle on doing in crypto.
