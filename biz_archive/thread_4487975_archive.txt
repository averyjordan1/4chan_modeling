Modum will change the world
Modum is very promising, get in now or get left behind.
Swiss pharma is huge.
LOL its literally wall of text proving nothing.Its not fud its logic that model represents worst of both worlds (shares/crypto), it is fucking security and there is fucking reason why this shit is banned in civilised world (and no swiss is not "for it" they just dont understand it, they think tech is new and great (which is true).This right here is real problem whit market today so many good tech on blockchain but so few reasons for coin itself.Why do you think everyone is not doing this REVOLUTIONARY model lol?Go ahead and diss me earn your 10 rupies for shilling.Buyer be aware.
Build a decent team of high ranked people in pharma AND supply chain.Invest a few millions out of your pocket to run pilot test including thousands of packages sent internationally.Get 34 customers waiting for your final product and start mass implementation.And I'll buy 5k$ worth of your coin, just like I did for Modum.But only if you care about the price going up (like owning a shitload of tokens that you won't be allowed to sell before years) and paying me a part of your profit.
Literally all of crypto is unregulated.
Example, sure Waltonchain has a token that has use apart from being a security.
But what makes WTC a safer investment?
If Waltonchain defrauds it’s investors or shuts down business, the token is worthless.
No extra protection.
With a security token, at least I have a dividend in a company I bet will succeed.
*I’m not knocking WTC.
Just used it as an example.

not putting those 5k$ in LINK insteadrofl dummy stay poor lfmao
