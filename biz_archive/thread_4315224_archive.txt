Literally this.
That was the dump, now its on its way back up.
Many people including myself still got 2.5x out of that.
And many whales bought at the top, which means rich bag holders.
Or floors.
Wait, what the fuck happens when their exchange comes back up?
BCH over $3k?
how long until its back up, any way to tell?
Or they get cold feet on lower prices everywhere else and dump like hell, causing mass panic
or they could absolutely dumpsuch was the case when Stellar pumped up crazy earlier in the year, Poloniex went down right at the peak and once it came back up there was blood everywhere

They drive the price irrespective of what others are doing.
BCH was a P&D scam> (((Satoshi's vision)))
Then why are the Bitcoin devs signaling support for it over the (((Segwit2x))) fork?
They've said that if the fork happens they'll switch all their resources to BCH.
