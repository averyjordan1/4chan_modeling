This will help give me a job and I will pray for your blessings and rich crypto future.
How about you explain to us in 5 or 6 bullet points (1 sentence long) what it was you did on your internship.Fucking retard.
I didn't fucking do an internship - I lied.
But I can't be honest anywhere other than 4chan.
I need to lie about this experience in order to gain an IT job as I have the knowledge and expertise but I lack the experience.
Hence I need to make up this internship to fill out my CV so they give me a chance at an interview, in which I can hopefully ace.
I am forced to make this up so they give me a chance, otherwise I'll never make it to interview stage.
Please help me anons I need a better job and I thought you guys would be the best at making me ace this internship section of my CV with sentences which portray good characteristics that employers are looking for.
Thing is, it would only be basic internship stuff but it has to be IT related.
