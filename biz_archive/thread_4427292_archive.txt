Who else sold their precious coins at this ridiculous cheap ass price to jump in the guaranteed neo moon mission?I feel absolutely disgusted for betraying my lovey coins, but hey, this shit will fucking explode and there is 3 days left.a man gotta do what he gotta do
Why do you believe?
How does it feel to have such big bags in "the chinese ethereum" that has next to not trading volume on eastern exchanges and is largely a speculator bubble propped up by western "crypto investors", in the hopes that a rumor about possible news that China will for some ridiculous reason give it a de facto monopoly on ICOs (lmao) is true?
I hope it is true so qtum cuckaroos kill themselves
why couldnt, NEO has now all positive signals, and NEO is now still relative cheap, compare to NEOs ATH, and potential
