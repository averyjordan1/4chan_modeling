I don't know much crypto history, but I see coins getting hyped up all the times.What are some coins/tokens that were in the past shilled hard, seemed absolutely great from team/product stand point of view, had proof of stake and product.. but then incredibly failed and went to zero and are now long gone/dissapeared?Really, give me some examples that HAPPENED IN PAST.
I don't want to repeat history, when I start trading.

None.
Every coin shilled here goes to the absolute Jupiter.

Slock.it's DAO That blockchain powered tinder websiteA lot of shitcoins went to zero but a lot of them rebranded and the tokens were re-used for other projects.
Most of them were not listed on exchanges or only on very shitty ones no one would touch with a 3.9 km pole so it's hard to remember.Coins shilled here are the most known and the most valuables projects that somehow managed to get out of the swamp.
