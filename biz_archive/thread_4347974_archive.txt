Let's compile a list of how to spot a reddit hereI will start with telltale signs:* Uses the word "HODL" no matter how old and saturated it is.
* When someone uses the word "hold", they reply JUST to use the word "HODL" because they find you incorrect otherwise* Are usually very narrow with their own grammar.
(hard to go along is a sign of autism)* Crazy about IOTA.
"IOTA is good tech with a good team and good partnerships"* Crazy about Factomfill in or your mother dies in her sleep tonight

Nice try.

nothing wrong with hanging out there.. i am an oldfag 4chaner but just last 3 weeks read r/cryptocurrency to widen my perspectivesunderstandreddit -> 4chan4chan -> reddit

r/cryptocurrency loves IOTA (probably because they support sand negros) so thats a dead giveaway
They make fun of people who complain about transaction fees and constantly claim the fee situation is either being fixed by bitcoin dev, was already fixed by segwit, or is the fault of evil forces beyond their or bitcoin devs control.

It's cool, more rocket ship fuel for me once IOTA hits bittrex and pajeets fomo over the news.I'll be looking down from the moon, cucks
I read about an AI program, which could determine whether a person was homosexual with +80% accuracy - from a photo.
I think one theoretically could construct an AI, which could determine whether one primary browses reddit or not, based on their posts.
Didn't really have anything to say.. but I love my mom.
