What will happen after BCH EDA fork on Monday?
Will the miners move back to BCH again?
Yes it will be more profitable to mine then as the price will be a lot higher too
Depends on the starting difficulty.So of course it'll be made more profitable, they'll choose a difficulty to be more profitable at current prices.
It's a dirty move desu.
Nah, forget what I wrote.
BTC has a higher hashrate again.
Maybe they want to confirm transactions so panic sellers can dump and then BCH pumps again
