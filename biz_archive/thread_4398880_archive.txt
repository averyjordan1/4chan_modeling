"If you can't handle my 870% losses you don't deserve my 4% gains"
870%Are u drunk?
870% los?
How do you even math bro?
Can't stop laughing at this picture.
Link memes are truly the fucking best.
What other board can revive a 10 year old image macro and make it relevant like this?
"I invested $10,000 in link, but now I've lost $87,000">"How did you lose $87,000 if you only risked $10,000?
Were you using margin?
">"No, Link just went down 870%">"So the exchange makes you pay them to take your LINK off your hands?
">"No, you still have to pay like $0.15 for it.
">"Well how much did you pay for it?
">"$0.40">"So you really lost ~60%?
">"No I lost 870%">"How do you figure?
">""
This is what happens when you open the financial markets to jagoffs who haven't finished high school math yet.
You seem upset.
4398928Newfags./biz/ literally always says lose 500% or lose 200% when they mean 1/(500%) and 1/(200%).
It's just the way this board full of poo in loo indians is.
It's closer to 15-16 cents now :(Where is the bottom??
that meme literally came out right when reddit invaded the board in 2012. kys cancer.
