I've been following VeChain ($VEN) for a few weeks now.
Watching all their news and partnership announcements really, this coin is completely undervalued.There's been rumblings that something will happen today.
My money's on a partnership that will get a lot of attention.
Most people do not know about VEN yet, but those that do are saying that the coming news will wake people up.I've been buying VEN every chance I get.
I was wondering why there's been so much volume.
Looks like their twitter account has become super active with new again.
I'm in
I also had vechain on the radar.
Hope it doesn't moon before tomorrow so I can get in
Oh man i bought in half a year ago and totally forgot i have 50 euro in this.
Fucking cash
My China plan is coming together.
Have a big bag of this, Loopring, NEO, and Lomo
Is now a good time to buy?
it's been trading around $0.25 since it came out.
Today it's around $0.30.
It has nowhere to go but up.
