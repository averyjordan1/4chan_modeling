*dies loudly*
comfydo eh?so glad I stopped listening to /biz
You would have made only x20 since icoFuck biz
Skipped it before it looked scammy to me.
Was pinkwojacking hard after it started trading.
Feels better now lol
Who the hell is buying these bags now?
Cucks
buy the dip
Its actually still not below ICO price lmfao
Lost about $2k on this, but I feel bad for the bros who lost upwards of $10k.
Holding the CFD bags in Blockfolio as a reminder to always go beyond the basic DD on a coin and that 90% of these shitcoins will fail in similar fashion in the months/years to follow.
It's even lower than that.CMC excludes ED, but includes Kucoin where trading halted.
It's at 1/3rd of ico price atm on edAlso someone really is buying large amounts on ed at the moment, no idea what that is about
sold the top AGAIN, easiest 20x of my life.
thank you so much biz
Yeah it's actually a fifth of the price shown in screenshot.
Down 97.5%
ico price was 0.0002 without presale, so it is already 25% below ICO
I sold 5secs after I read the telegram announcement.
Glad I had ED already open and ready

I'll trade anyone my ZIBER coins for their Confido coins.
Yeah when I first saw it shilled on /biz/ I checked their website and passed mostly based on their "team" section.
I love seeing this happen almost as much as getting out of BCH at just over 2k.
