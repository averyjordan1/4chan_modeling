is this for real?
on their official twitter pr page.
looks like a 13 year old designed it.
Done by a community member, not by the team.
Not an official piece of marketing material.
And fuck is it ever UGLY
pajeets in 3 2 1
the better question is, why do you care to talk shit about some 6 million dollar marketcap shitcoin in the first placedid you buy high?
FUCK please no
then why the fuck is this on their official twitter?
this dogshit might as well be espers at this point
Pajeetcoin
If you don't have a masternode your gonna want to kys in a year.
Haha silly Anon
The font is way too 90s for me.
But yeah this isn't official, it's just the team encouraging community contributions
Not sure
4347859I suppose that the better answer is that it isn't on their official twitter
yeah... it's from the PR account, apparently their head developer?
not a good look.
sad.
let's poo
4347814Ah, this guy again.
He bought the ATH and sold at 3k or so.
"Mommy where my instant gains mommy..." all over the slack.
Still pissed, haha, what a cunt.
>Take Obsidian logo>Make it shinyJesus christ that's ugly
just needs different background
I actually really like the shiny logo.
But not gonna lie everything else kind of sucks.
That one shill picture with the cell phone where everything was black was way better.
not seeing it on their twitter, am i a retard
who is running their company?
honestly the memes write themselves at this point.
zero consistency
