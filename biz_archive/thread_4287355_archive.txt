Be fearful when others are greedyBe greedy when others are fearful
Fear was like 5 hours aho, its more like time for desperation if you are still holding, i mean you cant even sell them if you wanted to
this is your last chance to sell fake btc for 6500 and buy real btc for under $1000been saying this for 2 weeks no one listenedthis is like christmas, you get to buy btc for under 1k again, are you retarded?

why did I think it would be a good idea to hodl btcBecause if you didn't sell and get out like a retard on the last be dip (5000 -> 3000) you'd be up even more than before.
You can't predict everyday movements of cryptoWill BTC keep going down?
Chances are yes.
Am I worried?
No
If you swapped BTC for BCH right now, it would be an act of selling low and buying high at the same time.
WHY DID I LISTEN TO YOU REDDIT KEK CORE SHILLS AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
yfw too smart too buy low
Yeah anon it's definitely gonna happen this time
Every shitcoin has moon days.
BCH is no exception.
Am I worried?
Nobecause you're noiconer and come here only to laugh at purple wojaks?
Because I bought in on BTC around $2k and tripled my holdings on it with alts
