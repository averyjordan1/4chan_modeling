How do I stop emotionally trading?My account would be like 4x bigger if I stopped doing the occasional fomo retard trade
The trick is to learn from your mistakes, easier said than done.
Then stop doing fomo retard trades.
Also this "trading without emotion" thing is a meme.
There will always be emotion there.
You just need to keep your wits in the heat of the moment.
It's gotta be doable to at least some degree.
Professional poker players have to deal with unavoidable massive downswings every so often, and they seem to hold up alright.
Completely training your evaluation of how you play, and therefore satisfaction, on the quality of your plays and adherance to your strategy regardless of your profit/loss
Set up your entrance & exit plan ahead of time, and don't deviate from it (unless emergency like the dev says he loves child porn)

Don't get excited about earning money.
Accept that every single one of these coins is a bullshit scam based on lies and then trade accordingly.
