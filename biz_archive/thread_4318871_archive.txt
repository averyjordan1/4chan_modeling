The BTC mempool is being spammed with high transactions, basically being manipulated by a group of people.
This is usually done by sending small transactions with a high fee.
With relations with BCH, this is a scheme to pull off with high profits, people may disagree and say that BCH is the new BTC because the fees are too high, but remember few years ago people though LTC or ETH was the new BTC, but BTC always dominated.
Think about it for a second, why did the BTC mempool suddenly spike in fees (+$15) in the past few days?
I heard people saying that BTCs Block is being halfed, but based on the http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com it happens in 13 Jun 2020, so that cannot be a reason.To those who also believe in BCH, https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets "BCH/KRW", if you do not know, KRW is a South Korean currency, they currently have the number one volume per 24 hours, they currently trade most of the BCH units, and if South Korea bans cryptocurrencies?
Goodluck BCH.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/6v2fib/south_koreans_on_bithumb_are_pumping_ethereum/Remember, if you are going with BCH, fine.
BTC has its ups and downs.
Open your eyes.
