UK here, its spread across normies here too.I've seen USI Tech being mentioned on facebook before.Someone will post something about Bitcoin then a ponzi drone will start spamming their referral link or advising people about USI Tech.Normies lap that shit up because they know fuck all about crypto.Its sad because all of these normies and boomers are going to get burnt and then probably call for regulation of crypto because they are too dumb to handle it.
