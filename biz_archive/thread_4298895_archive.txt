Is Dropshipping dead?
no, but the profit margin is small and you need a good supplier.
it's not easy like it used to be, so as a "free money" method it is effectively dead.
does that mean you have in the past, or still currently, dropship?
I'd love to learn more
there has never, and will never, be a method of reliably getting money for no effort on your part, so just forget it.Its not that dropshipping is "dead", its just that this "do no work, get big bucks" retarded fantasy kids have is just that; retarded fantasy.Even running scams requires work by scammers.
Dropshipping is the same as it ever was; people who work at will turn a profit.
People who don't want to work will play with the idea but never actually take action because effort.
china killed dropshipping.
just buy it and store it yourself
