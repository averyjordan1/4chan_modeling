Nocoiner here, what should I invest in?
Is BTC still worth it?
I'm looking long-term hold.

Anything top 10 is a good investment.
All top 10 coins went OVER 10x in the last year (compare November 2016 prices to November 2017 prices).
BTC is volatile right now so you can wait for a nice dip to get in, or you can get in ETH any time because it's currently very stable.
XMR is also a good option
Was also nocoiner until last night.
Bought in a bit on ethereum and waiting to see what's going on with the current BTC rollercoaster.
I think BTC will still shoot up a good deal in coming months.
Hoping it dips nice and low this week but we'll see.
>long-term hold.
