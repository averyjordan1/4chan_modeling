Do I buy this?Ignis airdrop coming in soon.Or do I buy NXT?
All in, Ardor is the superior coin.
yes, $30 by Q1 not even joking this shits like link 2.0 but with devs who communicate
4511186You know it's a good buy because these threads about it are fucking empty and the dev crew, website and product is all fucking phenomenal.
4511261I see.
Thanks all :D
I don't know if your interested in blockchain technology outside of making money, but if you are, you should certainly check out their whitepaper.
Their approach to the scaling problem is so novel and intriguing (child and side chains).
Ardor is the new platform, they give you 1on1 for the new token once it goes live First ICO on the platform is Ignis, 2 NXT will give you 1 Ignis.
i think the snapshot is november 25th actually
nvm december 25th
Read the whitepaper, bought...
boughtRight?
Isn't this shit fucking wild?
Too bad /biz/ doesn't even know what a blockchain is beyond a money maker.What's your total portfolio amount?
