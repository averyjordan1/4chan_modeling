> That BCH is what satoshi wanted> That BCH is decentralized> That BCH is the kingIts ran by chinese miners, when did 4chan become chink lovers?Aww jeez rick I mean more hashpower there right now aww jeez.> No shit Morty miners want the most profitable coin and they keep dropping BCH difficulty level to allow hyper mining
All it takes is a horde of chinks with ASICs to fork and kill the top coin.Future coins take note.
Kill ASICs with a non-contentious hard mining algorithm fork before they grow out of control.No nation can compete against Chinese manufacturing by volume.
Americans have bitcoin HODL memesChinese have bitcoin minersI wonder what satochi would want
I wonder what satochi would wantNot a crypto centralized by a single group of Chinese miners?
BCH is gonna be even worse in that regard
We will kill BCH too.
I am against ASIC mining I mean centralized mining.
Mining should be for everyone and can be done in their home.
Rick and MortyfagGo beg for your sauce at McDonalds and leave crypto for people who have graduated from middle school
Rick and Morty is fun.
And has some redpills.
Any btard or pollack should be able to enjoy it
It's not the miners that are the problem if you that is the problem.
The miners don't control anything.
At all.
Miners are there to make money.
Who gives a shit what coin they mine.
btard or pollack>not even using the slashesGET OFF FAGGOT
Look at this dude getting unironically triggered by bait
Wait til btc becomes more profitable and they swap back, oh wait then bch will readjust its difficulty down to make sure it remains
Jihan's the fucking worst.
So much for decentralization and Satoshi's vision
Look at this faggot being a fag
