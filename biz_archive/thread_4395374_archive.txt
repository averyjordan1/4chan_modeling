Hello /biz, i am currently 22 years old and studying software engineering in austria, in 1 year i will finish university.I have the idea of starting an online Crypto currency casino.The idea is simple, there is just a roulette game with nice visuals, you can deposit every kind of crypto currency and gamble with that on my platform.
I have really cool designs and ideas, but my only problem is money, you dont get an investor for gambling that easy so i thought about asking /biz for a few bucks to help me out.When my site will be online and you credited me , just send me your wallet adress and i will check if you sent me something and i will credit you with free spins or bitcoin.I have atm about 5000€, but that will be not enough and i am working beside university as security (18€/hour) and everything is going to flew into my project.Pls help me out /biz :DETH adress: 0xb0af0829297f3c93c6249ecc93abf15073a63699THX

Just program it on a lisk sidechain when the SDK comes out, then you can just focus on user experience and program everything in javascript and make it phone compatible
