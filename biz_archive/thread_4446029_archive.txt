>not waiting for any tax crimes to expire and just comfy hodling in the meantime>as a result you keep getting richer because BTC always goes up long term>inb4 tax crimes never expire in my country>then move to a non cuck country
Does this actually work?
4446043Pay your taxes or your coins will moon while you are in jail
If you mined the coins, or they paid you in exchange of a certain product or service, they can never know you own X BTC so stfu cuck.You just look at your country's legislation and HODL X years until you are free of any problems, and just pay whatever usual tax, not some retarded extra taxing because it's considered a job to mine or accept payments in BTC, guaranteeing you never get rich.
Hope the tax man uses lube on you anon
I don't own any crypto (unfortunately).
Im just saying that is what you can do if you want to avoid being rapped by the taxman and the BBCs.
Of course it does, but only if you didn't buy the bitcoins.Otherwise you are at risk that (((they))) request all information to exchanges and would find your trades.Someone that mines or accept BTC payments for services or products is basically invisible to (((them)))
i dont own any crypto (unfortunately)nicely played.
i'm sure the authorities will chuckle at this little canard before bending you over and fucking you to death
