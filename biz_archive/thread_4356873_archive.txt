ITT: Next 1$ tokens
% Agreed.
I bought the Powr Ledger ICO, it's bringing amazing profits.
/biz/ won't listen though.
They all jump on the chainlink/ark/digibyte shitcoins, they'll never invest in this.
rektit will be much higher than $1.
It's projected to be $10-15.
They have a trial partnership with Orion which is Australia and NZ's largest energy provider.
investing at ath is like taking a knife and pushing the pointy end through your eye socket
I just like how the knife feels in my eye
buy at 0.20
Bought at 0.3 regret nothing
Is there any truth in Pajeeka report being PWR?
Listed on trex now.
look at who is on the team.
pink wojaks coming soon for everyone who isnt buying now.
He's going to release buy up to of $1
He's going to release buy up to of $1It's fuckin 30 cents now, why the hell would he advise to go in on a coin that will (supposedly) go 3x from today to his shill report release?I'm in this for swing trading, don't try to convert me to a holder.
because his picks go 500-5000% gains.
3x from today is nothing.
not to mention it will increase from today until his report is released.
so it will not be a 3x increase from the price point which he is saying buy.
>tfw I bought at $0.18
