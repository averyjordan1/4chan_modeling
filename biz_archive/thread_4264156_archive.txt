Why are you not in yet?
DYOR!
>bought at 7>sold at 2this was my first and only crypto mistake
Are you a fucking retard?
So you bought 40% above ATH of 5$?Because ICN is probably the WORST project in the top, scamming people, losing 120k ETH in parity hack and actually having a useless token.So that's why you don't go all in in some eastern europe scamshit projects.
The team has found out the viability of ICN coin is a problem for them, as the need of staking it to perform actions on the plattform will cause a friction to managers/users If you have to fuck users (source of revenue) or array managers (the ones that make the plattform being worthy) or icn investors (Internet weaboos to whom you hold no legal vinculation),who would you fuck?
Well, it just deprives the platform the legitimacy of being a "cryptocurrency".
It is just a shitty excuse to actually have some retard weaboos fund your project with millions.
ICN ... SCAMERS FROM SLOVENIJA ... but they got full acc of euros ...GG to them
All /biz/ are negative, time to buy
I'd say it is dead money, you can't really gain or lose any more on that.
But then again I remember what happened to DGB, Siacoin and BTS.
