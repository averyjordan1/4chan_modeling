Thanks
Fuck.
Please, return my money, OP!
Ok, give me a mo
Like this?
Think you could replace the Bitcoin logo with the UNC logo and add the little marks on it?
IDK.
I'm a brit, what the fuck is a unc logo?

Can you send me some Bitcoin Blue?Big fan of ethereum blue here
oh, like in your op.
Sure I could.
But then what are you asking for - the light blue disk with a UNC logo instead of a B?
With see-thru background?
Yeah exactlyHopefully its not too hard to add those little ear marks above and below the UNC logo, but ideally I'd want that modified UNC logo to replace the B in the disk, tilted the same way.
I guess to make it clear its supposed to be mimicking the BTC logo
It looks like shit here because the OP UNC logo is ALOT smaller than the disk.
You want a smaller disk?
Or link me to a bigger logo?
Also the marks, you mean the two lines above and below that make like a dollar sign?
Yeah exactly.
It doesnt have to be the same size.
Its going to be shrunk and put on a pen so it wouldnt be a problem
cool.
the extra marks are tricky, post me a mailinator address or some shit in case the bread gets archived
BitToes@mailinator.comI'll be checking this thread and try to keep it alive tho
cool brb


OP you did a bad job of communicating what you want.
You want the image in your OP tinted a lighter shade of blue and with the BTC logo replaced with the logo in the first image you linked?How are you paying?
BTC?
ETH?
GO TO HELL CAROLINA GO TO HELL
Perfect, just fix the color and I'll send to the address.
Eth address pls
4384918Or maybe make the logo smaller and/or the tick marks more pronounced?
Looks a bit busy atm
For example, check out the spacing between the end of the B letter and the edge of the circle.
There is much more space in the BTC logo
Ticks are going to look like ass AND take forever

So someone else can put in ticks = here the original
sent ;)
Thanks anon.
Post your Eth address.If anyone makes a better logo I'll still send to the guy who makes a better logo as well.Really any combo of the NC logo and something blockchain related will do
