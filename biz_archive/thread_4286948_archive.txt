Gentlemen, please enter the vessel and submit all that you can part with for a matter of time.
It won't be long for before our turbulent travel finally pierces the enriched atmosphere.
What is the basis for this prognosis?
i cant keep briefing people here, you can google their current status and target and trajectory.>bombarider gave most of their c-series stake to Airbus (its a top of the class state of the art plane which attracts most buyers)>plans to sell thousands of planes>waiting for congress to finalize the whole bulllshit Boeing issue and remove the tarifs permanently>canada potentially buying fighter jets from airbus giving airbus more press and presence>bombardier is giving the states thousands of jobs by moving some manufacturing to Alabama>they can also now concentrate on other sectors like rail to promote material and transactionsthey have a very god outlook, excellent product + ideal production settings + top class rating + plus international interest and attention (buyers) + strong political importance (which is the basis of all aerospace trade) its looking to grow indefinitely, how much?
well see with more deals being confirmed
Alright, thanks for the run down, but the C-series is a decade behind the market.
Embraer stole their market share with the E-jets which are now widespread.The only good play now is to hope that Congress will rule in favor of Bombardier.Canada is buying the F-35, and how does Airbus translate well for Bombardier?Bombardier is a terribly managed company, at the core.
the main reason they partnered with airbus was to avoid the crazy xes the states was imposing and since they imposed taxes on bombardier the canadian goverment postponed buy fighter jets from boeing, which you are now saying the avoided completely i guess, as for the c-series being behind, thats not what i have been reading, however i trust airbus wouldnt sign on to carry almost half the product if they didnt see a prmise for profit in the market
