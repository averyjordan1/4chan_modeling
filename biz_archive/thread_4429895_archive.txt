>the bitcoin network is being attacked with small, spam transactions paying low fees of $10 each
yeah they're called users lol
Nobody cares except>muh coffee
WHY WONT YOU LET ME STORE MY COFFEEE TRANSACTION FOREVER ON AN IMMUTABLE LEDGER REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
TX numbers are down from yesterday.
Only 43k right now.
Hm, this raises an interesting question.
If you pay for coffee with bitcoin do you have to wait 50 minutes for your coffee?
only 43k
'low fees' I pay 0.005$ on ethereum you idiots
Nope bc the amount of purple who try a double spend attack for a coffee is miniscule.
Also, you would use the lightning network where double spend attacks are impossible due to how the ln works
Ah that's the reason for the whole smart contracts business right?
thats 42999 more people using btc than bcash
Good look opening a payment channel everytime you want to buy a coffee.
Core cucks are against Fiat and Bitcoin Cash but want a coin that can´t be used as Cash.
Logic
lol
How about keeping the payment channel open in the lightning >network< you lobotomized monkey?
:D
yeah nobody cares except>using bitcoin as a currency, the entire point of it
How does Roger Ver's semen taste?
Do you only have one coffee shop in your city?
I don´t want my BTC locked up for every store in my city.
If you would go out more often you would know that people like to visit different shops in different cities
