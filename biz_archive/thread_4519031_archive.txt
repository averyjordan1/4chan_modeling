There was a guy in here couple days ago and he had this dream and he shorted btc at around 8300 with 25x lev.
and he made 33k in 2 hours.I had a dream as well 2 days ago - I was trading and BCH spiked to $5000 and then dropped to around $3000.It might be just a dream after strong influnce of that guy but you never know...
Lol gtfoh with that hippie horseshit
BCH bagholder detected, keep dreaming your sweet dreams while everyone else makes money
Did you buy at 2.5k two weeks ago?
where can you margin trade for 25x leverage?
Actually no, I bought at $600...
I have no idea mate - maybe bittfinex?
Also had a dream about the dragonslayer but i can't remember how much just that it moons alot!
Bought when waking up, no way gonna miss this.
I'm very sceptical about dreams but this one was different - I was acctually trading, I remember coins I bought and massive spike to $5000!!
!I woke up with a smile on my face :)
I like my bags mate.
I don't mind other people making money.
I admire successful people :)
