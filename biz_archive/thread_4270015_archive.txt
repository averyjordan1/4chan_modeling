Reminder that if you arent all in on LSK you are a dumbcunt that hates BenjaminsChart repetition is uncanny.

763 lisk reporting in :( i know im short but that all i got, hodling since july
>he isn't all in on RDN
hurrr i cant read Op's words for myselfLisk has been working with Rlevance and Taikonauten on their strategy and branding, search how big their previous work has been.
also read up on sidechains and the security and scalability they provide.
~~ 1300 lisk holder since may.Most comfy coin to hold, maybe except Ark.
Some people says that this is second ethereum.
Tbh I am not that optimistic, but 20$ per lisk eoy is really possible.I am holding only 3 coins right now: Lisk, Ark and Obsidian.
Lisk and Ark are really safe investment imo, not sure about Obsidian.this.
Yep, maybe short term, there are better choices, but if you want comfy and steady gains - buy lisk.
we can see LISK to 20 maybe by summer.
I also like the coin and the idea behind it.
Ark will eventually swallow this coin's mcap
