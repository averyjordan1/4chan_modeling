Hey biz, can someone tell me if I just lost my ETH pic related is the tx I made over 2 hours ago and it still hasn't delivered to Bittrex.
I checke every character of the hex and it there were no errors.
Wtf did I lose my ETH?
I mean it's only $12 so no big deal, but I really don't understand what happened.
Bumping for a quick answer
