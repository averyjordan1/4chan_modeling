No stop begging on my board
Not begging.
Asking for help.
I can send you your eth back since im selling btcr for a little profit, so if any of you do send give me a return address and i can pay you your 0.01 eth back.
I do not plan on running off with your 3 $ what do you think im gonna do, go buy a kebab or what...
