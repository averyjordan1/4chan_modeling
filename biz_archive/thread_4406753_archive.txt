So, as many of you guys know, if BTC breaks 8k on Bittrex, alts are finished.
If you are bag hodling alts, roll digits to curse BTC.
Singles: BTC drops by $1 x your digit>ie if you roll 9, BTC drops $1x9 = $9>zero= nothing happens, rerollDubs: drops $10 x last digitTrips: drops $100 x last digitQuads: drops $1000 x last digitQuints: ???
