/biz/ has so many newfags lately its insane.But no, stay awhile, learn that /biz/ is actually good for making money, but also can lose you 1000s in seconds.Many people are here are Machiavellian, in the sense that they understand many have to lose to allow winners, which is true.
But I want you to succeed newfag.
Let me tell you this.1.)
/biz/ is one of the best forums for finding out good cryptos to keep on your radar.
Each one of my successful gains started here because some anon mentioned it.
Keep that in mind and DYOR.2.)
This board is also good at generated the strongest sense of FOMO I've ever seen online.All of these "get in or stay poor" threads are hilarious because if a pump has started you are too late, and if you somehow get in, it was probably at ATH and now you have to deal with a 30%-50% retracement.
NEVER BUY A COIN THAT +10%I promise you that the coin you want will fall back and you wont get bags.Be smart out there.
Realize that /biz/ is an amazing tool but will burn most of you.BTW, dont buy PWR, REQ, RDN, ICN, FUN, XMR or anything with +10% today.
Its better to play it safe, and if you miss the moon oh well, better than having heavy fucking bags-Farewell and good luck
Buy REQ and, if it drops, sell and buy BCH.Good luck player.
>reddit and mortyDon't listen to this fucking idiot
I bought POWR above your 10% trash rule and made Â£200 in an hour and sold.
Where is your god now?
Fun fact.
Link is at an all time low.
Good time to buy.
Damn, it's not often you see someone here give legit good advice.
80% of /biz/ right now is stinky linkies and powr bottoms shitting all over the place like the pajeets they are.

"POWR Bottom" lol

newfag here, just bought POWR minutes ago, +60%I will thank you later
why not req?
Word, i chased 2 or 3 pumps when i got to biz and learned quick.
Buy $ESPERS on the yobit exchange sirs many lambos and women
200Thats cute
NEVER BUY A COIN THAT +10%Eh, I bought powr at 40 and I'm on 20% profit already
good post
I hope you realize that I'm giving general advice.
Im sure there are many of you that get lucky, but just realize its luck and nothing else.
Good noob advice but you missed about buying the BTC dips!
Buy coins that are rarely if ever shilled.
Sell when /biz/tards are in full fomo, the train is just departing threads and you get out at least 3-5x your money
