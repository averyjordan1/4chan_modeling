Recently graduated with an econ degree.
I'm trying to find a job as some type of financial or investment analyst.
I feel like I don't know enough to get a job though.
What should I know so that I feel comfortable going to an interview?
Some good resources?
I have a Bullshit corporate finance job with my econ degree.
I got it by interning at a company which recruits heavily from my uni.
It has nothing to do with investments it's predominantly cost accounting mixed with financial planning and analysis.
