I hope you bought the dip anon.
it's almost Monday morning in East Asia, and all the banks will be open and available to wire transfer more KRW to Korean exchanges.
the fork upgrade will take place Monday night.
if you thought the $2500 pump was insane, buckle up
the fork upgrade will take place Monday night.Why do people keep talking positively about that?
It's the most centralized shit ever
how the fuck can you back btc core and say anything about centralization?
holy fuck you people are so fucking uninformed
back btc coreI want both to die off, but at the very least core sticking around a little longer keeps faith in crypto as a whole
Plus a lot of those 100k unconfirmed transactions are people sending to exchange to buy BCH.

same argumet, keeps faith in fiat, to bail-out banks, was used.you know, the very reason why we have nice things such as Bitcoin...Cash.
somehow this pic reminds me of this one
H-How i will we fly?
nice things such as Bitcoin...Cash.Changing one value doesn't make Cash all that much better than BTC in the long-run.
It's just continuing to push a future problem farther down the road
People literally can't sell BTC quick enough.
It's such a great "store of value" that it becomes worthless before you can offload it.
I withdrew a load of BCH and the fee was 60cents or some shit.
Tards who bought the top right before the dump are iching to get back into btc.
Roger can't pump it fast enough.
:D
BCash is scaling bitcoin as intended.
4326553the scared core shills are returning lmao
Take care of those 166.000 unconfirmed transactions first pls ;3
As soon as you stop spamming the mempool.
so bitcoin.org, reddit bitcoin and bitcointalk all owned by the same person is not ""centralised""
