>mfw people here use 2x, 3x, 10x, 11x, etc because they don't know how to express it in percentages lmao
How did u even come to that conclusion?
You sound fucking retarded yourself.
"muh 343.1784% gainzzzz"
 2x = 20%> 3x = 30%> 10x = 100%> 11x = 110%there u faggotretard
Or maybe because it's a lot more impactful retard.
Pretty sure everyone knows what percentages mean.
It's an easier metric to write and quantify.This guy gets it
%=2x200%=4x1000%=10xEasy.
% is 3x you retard
Kek.I remember saying that I would sell my REQ ICO bags at a 50% gain (and I did), but some pajeets thought I meant -50% (0.5x) and called me a "salty burger".LMAO, also enjoy those bags.
looks like they were right tho
No it's not retard!!
> i 200%ed my investment
Is that even possible?
Did you mean 200/100..
%=double initial investment.100%*2=200%200%=2*double initial investment200%=four times initial investment.It really isn't that hard.
yes it is3x100 = 300100 + 100*200% = 300
This must be bait, but anyway:x:= current pricey:= price you paid>Your gain is given by (x-y)/y.2=(x-y)/y iff 2y=x-y iff 3y=x.
kek
wait?I thought 10x was 10x your investment?
LOL this thread.
Gonna have to meme it laterTrue or false?
94% of /biz/ will answer this wrong!
He's dropping a zero retard.
4428618Fine.100%=2x200%=3x300%=4x400%=5x500%=6x600%=7x700%=8x800%=9x900%=10x1000%=11x
4428618its a question of perspective, neither of you are wrong"I gained 100%" = 2x"my investment is 200% of its initial amount" = 2x
>not using traditional fractional oddsMy investment came through today at 9 / 2
This.
Most people here are retarded, Christ.
It depends how you say it folks.
Saying 2x or 4x is much less confusing and it easier to write.
No reason to bring confusion into it.
who cares lol
No, he's not.
100%=2x and 200%=4x doesn't make sense in either case.
He said 200% = 3x, not 4xwhich is to say he probably means "he gained 200%", which would be 3x

there are people here who are nocoiners
MFW when fag op never had more than a 2x to know what that feel is like
