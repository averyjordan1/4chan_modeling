I don't think tether or much else would destroy BTC or that we will see a crash at least until after the normies enter the market in hordes and lose some money first.
BUT, what would happen to the market overall if BTC ate shit down to 2k or if BCH actually pulled off a "flippening"?
How do you predict this would effect the market as a whole?
