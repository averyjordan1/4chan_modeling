do u think all this shilling is true bout elon musk partnering with the some unknown mayor of perth who prob doesn't know a thing about blockchain?just another scam coin cashing in on blockchain.
Is it a scam?
I don't have much to lose, I sold my safex and digibyte for it.
Both shitcoins I held since literally june.
If scam what should I put my dollars in?
Right now I'm mostly into btc and eth.
But my shitcoin cash i put into POWER.
on top of that, we dont have an energy crisis here in Australia contrary to belief.
We have all the natural resource in the world, that could light the glob.
This project is a joke, they are problem not the solution.

some whales may get bored and decide to pump it for fun.everything gets pumped eventually.
true dat.
most of australia doesn't have energy issues.
just the state of south australia and it's capital Perth, due to poor state government management.Perth is a like a tiny city.
Nobody cares about Perth man.
This coin is a fucking scam.
