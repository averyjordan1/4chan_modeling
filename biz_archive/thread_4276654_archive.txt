If your non American Bitfinex otherwise Hitbtc
Aussie.
Just asking because I already have an account with HitBTC, just haven't used it.
hitbtc is fine
Hehe alright, easy 10x in a year with a chance of 20x+ GL
Does ETP have an equivalent to NEO's GAS?
And if so, does Bitfinex give it out to exchange holders like how Binance gives GAS for NEO holders?
they'll freeze your coins for a year, but give you up to 20%.
I have 10k frozen and 5k untapped
bigger balls then me
Bitfinex will, or is that on the ETP wallet?
Holy shit I feel dumb.
Mainly because I feel like investing in this coin solely on how fucking cool the OP pic is.
Guess I should look into it before actually spending money though.
