I'll start INTP80k in crypto
INTP15k in link req omg & etp
INTP.
20k.
I started with 2k but I have been stuck at this level for past 4 months.
I just keep doing random shit and keep changing strategies when nothing seems to work.
Worst part is my impatience and I make shit tier mistakes because of it; while intution lack of attention also hurts.
The only thing I do right is that I tend to dodge major disastors but I can't make a proper trade unless I get lucky.
Help me INTP bros, give me strategic recommendations.
INTP bro watch MANA, LRC,NEO,XMR, and NULS very closely the next couple days/weeks.
Also hold some bcash / btc 1:1 (40-30%).
Have 10% in tether to buy dips go all in on these shitcoins.
Personally LRC looks super tasty rn

You think it's really the stress or you'd rather do something you like more?
INTP4k :'(>tfw got into crypto and alts in september at the beginning of massive alt bear marketUp 1000 in the last 2 days though
INTPjust started with 1k gonna get to 100k i swear on me mum m8.
i'll do it for ancestral jews in my blood.
I will have honor.
ENTJStarted with $3k in august.at $6k now.Could have made more if I didn't make bad decisions.
Well, yeah min-wage jobs usually mean I need to work with customers.
its social stress that shows and develops into social ticks, working with people I don't know starts to get me worked up because I try to read people's body language, I have no control over that if I don't know them.
So customer assistance or service is out of the picture.School is also too much for me, I had to be pulled at at grade 8 because i kept having breakdowns in class.I want to be a programmer, infomatics and economics are both major interests of mine and I think I could get somewheres in blockchain development.
I just have to continue self-teaching myself and try networking with people online.
But most career paths for me I simply can't go.
Yeah, that's a tough one.
I pretty much missed 1/3 of freshman year.
Maybe an online career is good if these are really problems and not rather a chore you're trying to not complete.
A problem is unfix-able, such as being crippled.The human body is incredibly adaptive and can do almost anything if it's pushed.
1 miles to 26 miles.
Elementary school to a doctorate.
totally, I hope I can even out over time with medication.
My psych makes me go to small community events so I'm not avoiding my triggers or making myself totally alienated, and every month I have a community health worker visit my place to take me to larger events where I can have a one on one with that worker with all the social noise in the background.
Better then when I was in school but still not good enough to become a whole member of society.
I need to get to a point I'd say I don't feel negative about my ticks, that I either assume people just accept me despite them or people might even find a charm to it.
INTP 1k -> 1.5k since June...
Very heavy LINK tho.

ENTP master race coming through.
I'm smarter than you, 6'1 AND I'm good with people.WHERE MY FELLOW CHADS AT?
good luck jumping all over the place, never commiting to anything, never finishing anything & being perceived as an unreliable clown basically.anyway, I'm not much better but I guess my introversion spares my from uncontrollably splerging like an ENTP because I can sit in my room for months without needing to make any contact with the outside world.
