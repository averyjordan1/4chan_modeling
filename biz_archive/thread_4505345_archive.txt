Hey /biz/, haven't posted here since July when alts started their bear trend.Good news and bad news.Good news: alt season is starting, and will pump with BTC for the next few months, bigger than before.Bad news: this will not apply to all alts.
Unlike April where you could throw a dart and get an easy 8x, only some alts will make it this time.If you haven't bought alts recently, it's not too late obviously.
In fact, now you can jump in with confidence rather than risky buying a month ago.Just be careful with the biz shill of the week unless it has strong fundamentals.
(stay away from ICO's)I personally recommend XMR, DCR, ZEC, ETC, DASH, ETH.
These will pump first -- the high caps.
Then will flow into mid coins like VTC, XCP, XEL, LBC, VIA, BAT, SYS.Worth snagging lowcaps but it is riskier and they will pump last.
I don't want to make any recommendations in that realm.If there is any type of coins to focus on for long term 2018 gains, I would recommend coins with Atomic Swaps, Lightning Network, and Segwit like VTC and DCR.
XCP would be an under the radar buy in that category.Should still have highest % in BTC.
Will break 10k before NYE but after a correction to high 6k.good luck biz.
remember to take profit on the way up.
Actually a pretty fun time.
If you're in Vegas, highly recommend checking out Legends.If you just wanna burn fiat like a reasonable person I recommend Spearmint Rhino
