Is dropship still a thing?
Anyone doing real business with it?
shill me on dropshippinghow easy is it to make big returns?
It was great back in 2013, but Chinamen have caught on and it's no longer as easy.
Still setting up a shop but I am not dropshipping.
I am buying chink goods directly from chinks and not aliex so my prices are way lower than aliex.
Drawback is I don't have a lot of products.
Dropshipping is so 2012
