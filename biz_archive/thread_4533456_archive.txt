pls no larp or troll bros. these faggots are driving me insane.
been waiting fucking 5 days already.
atleast 3 weeks , maybe 5
After 12 days, I went to their slack, and politely asked for help.
Problem solved in 15 minutes.
never use bittrex, I had the same experience as the posters above me.
it's been a problem for a long time and they refuse to hire more personnel.
this, bittrex sucks ass.They randomly change their withdrawal limits and are a fucking pain in the ass
I see everyone saying don't use Bitrex but no one is giving any alternatives.
well bittrex, poloniex and btc-e are the only exchanges I've used and bittrex is the worst, apart from the whole btc-e exit scam which didnt involve me
This.
Slack is the quickest way to solve a lot of communication issues.
I don't know why people never check their fuckin' email.
