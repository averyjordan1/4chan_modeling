So far I've mainly just held but if I start getting into more trading what's the best site for watching multiple real time charts?
Do people just use whatever chart's on the exchange they're trading on?
or a customized TradingView setup?
or something else?
Cryptowatch looks pretty good.
Can't give you any advice on trading though.
I want to learn as well.
Any recommendations, resources?
Cryptowatch and Bittrex.
ah thanks a lot, looked at Cryptowatch and it's pretty much exactly what I'd hoped for.
Can't recommend too much right now.
I bought BTC quite a few months back and just held it.
Have been doing some reading and watching videos in the meantime.If you're really new, I found "DataDash" videos on youtube to be quite good.
If you go to his channel, click playlist, and watch the "DataDash | Trading Tips" videos, he explains how to interpret and use most common charts.
Also has a variety of other good educational & opinion videos.

There is coinigy, and then there's all the other meme charts.
Pay for that thing and you're set.
