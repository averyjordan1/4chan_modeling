WHY IS THE MINING DIFFICULTY SO HIGH GOD DAMNN TI
Because THEY know chancoin will be worth $1 by 2018 so it's worth mining right now.
Hey, are you a stupid poor piece of shit?
Got no hope in life?
I'd like to talk to you for a minute about a business deal.
You see, there's an obscure internet forum which prides itself on posts being anonymous.
But by throwing away that model, and tying posts to virtual wallets, this will improve the site greatly.
What can you do to make money, you ask?
It's simple, buy a new virtual currency we've made that people will tip each other on the site with, before cashing it out to bitcoin or USD.
omg
Buy that coin, and as other people cash out, just hold it.
Why will it go up in value, you ask?
Well, I don't really have a good answer for that, in fact we're all just hoping you'll buy some so we can sell some of ours.
You see there's barely anyone buying right now, and after months of desperate spamming, we'd really like to get something out of this.
FUDing a free coinHey get a load of this guyYou're aware they give it out for free right?
This is the crypto equivalent of reddit comment karma, but instead of being fucking useless, you can trade it for other things.
and its been going up in value
Literally can generate a wallet address by clicking a button

ok cool

Shove your shitty wallet, it doesn't even build on Arch or Fedora (same error as in https://github.com/FeatherCoin/Feathercoin/issues/177)I'm too lazy to make a github issue rn
please make the issue.. we are so desperate for any attention or interest at all.
please no trolling in the discord, we've had a troll problem with nano, Andy, neo nano, nano 2, etc... the last thing we need are more trolls, trolls will be kicked and banned from discord.
