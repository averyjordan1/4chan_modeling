How many btc for a gf like that
 million after this dip
I'm sure you could commission a god tier vr waifu system with most of the BTC out there 10 million btc should do it
No you maniac.
Buy in a week from now.
Why?I'm going to do my homework and read up on all this in the next few days, but can you offer a quick explanation to put me on the right path?
Because everything is crashing.
Wait till BTC hits 4800.
If youâ€™re serious take this time to do research.
Hmm... ok. My main problem right now is conflicting information.
I read one article that says it's the end of the world for BC, then another that says buy them right now.
I've been wanting to get into the BC market for a while now but now I'm not sure what to believe.
Leave for at least a month.
Do not buy anything right now.
Enjoy the shit show.
You won't know until it's too late.
Andthat's the point.
Can someone recommend a reliable source for news and info on this stuff?
I don't know who to believe.And of course more info on the topic is welcome too.
That's a pretty huge jump in value.
I'm impressed.
Good taste OP

Everything is in flux.
No one knows if BCH or BTC will reign supreme.I say buy both*.
I think they'll both coexist.
*nothing I say counts as financial advice.
