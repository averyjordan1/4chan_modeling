Some anon told me to visit reddit.com/r/confidoThis is beyond hilarious
>healthy correction
can't stop laughing at the shills who got rekt>muh low market cap>muh comfydo
Oh my god.. the stupidity.. my head hurts reading that
Wait till the whole rest of the ICO market follows suit.The screencaps will fill the streets.
Wasn't this coin endorsed by HuffPo or some shit?
haven't read the article but >omg it's in huffpo is a fucking blog on their platform 99% of the time
I wouldnt feel so comfy holding BTC or ETH either if I were you.
If ICO goes to shit so does ETH and BTC is on the verge of death as well.There is no safe space in the crypto market.
This is the world we live in.
Some of us will get rich while others kill themselves.
why are redditors so fucking naive?
Can someone tell me what's the deal with Confido?
Why do people keep going for new coins?
Seems like there are more and more and more crypto coins coming up - but whats would be the reason to have dozens of diffrent coins?
Even if Bitcoin and maybe a handfull other really become something huge - there is no need to "invent" new cryptocoins every week - except hoping to create a quick hype for a few weeks, and then cash out before it crashes.Even if bitcoin is not just a bubble, all those small coins certainly are
if you tell us how much you bought and at what price first
It was a low mkt cap coin (400,000 USD ICO) that got shilled very hard on /biz/, if you listened you would have made massive 10x-20x gains in the first few days, which you should have sold.
Unfortunately niggers get greedy as they do and held the CFD hoping for it to go even higher until a few hours ago when the devs announced their lawyer fucked them up the ass with a contract that they can't afford to uphold so they shut down operations indefinitely -> coin tanks in value.Let this be a lesson: always cash out your initial investment x2 and only play with what you can afford to lose
I'm all in on Bitcoin.
82%> "a healthy correction"LMFAO
>its a completely normal and healthy correctionLMAO
Haha.
Wut?
On one hand, that sucks for the people involved, on the other hand, this is awesome.
Does this relate to link at all?
Never trust people that look like these guys.
Only trust people that look like complete nerds (except Vitalik and the fat guy from Chainlink).
Top kek if true.
Honestly I want to more and more do my own scam ico.
didnt even own any CFD but want to punch that nick guy in the face
Yes, Link will follow the same dark path.
I know.
It's 'Fat Hogs' or poor people that need moonshots.
It's even higher risk in a high risk market.
Worried about that actually.
That's would suck
Completely normal and a healthy correctionFucking hell they've already reached a completely delusional state.
I'm just kidding around, I think Link will be fine most likely.
If it happened tho people would find Sergei and do some pretty bad things given 0 communication
> little gem coinohohoho
Kidding right???
They have legal troubles .
Go to their Twitter.
You're fucked
Wow, they are like the embercoiners except with no stake rewards.

Why do people keep going for new coins?
Thinking they will strike it rich.There's a long tail of new coins.
Only the top 10 will matter anyway.The more coins that come out, the less chances they have to stand out.I would only bet on ETH at this point, since they all depend on it for gas.

Holy fuuk.Haven't laughed so hard in a while.Keep the confido memes coming boys
Another one shilled by biz that's down 80% since shilling .
Once you hear it on biz you're too late, you're buying bags ... link, confido
Once you hear it on biz you're too late, you're buying bags ... link, confidoWut?
Both ICOs got shilled, I should know because the only reason I got into the LINK presale is because of pooled links being posted here.
The fact that some dumbasses here jump in despite being late does not change when both originally started being shilled.
There mistake was saying they'd partner with chainlink, Insta dump
