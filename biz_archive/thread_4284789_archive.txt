So scaling is all the rage now....Im not buying bch because....well i dont want to start arguing......
BUT we can see some scaling solutions on some other fronts.ETH is getting microraiden this month, DECR is getting its lightning network this month (vert will follow soon), also VIA is getting lightning but im not buying romano's coin.I already have some rdn (bought at a pretty high price unfortunately), but im thinking about buying DECR - see how it handled the btc dip without giving a fuck....maybe smart money is already getting in?
Can we trust the team will deliver?
do i have to fucking beg for an answer?
?
