Hi friends!I'm new to /biz/ and am interested in getting more into "cryptocurrency".
It sounds like the market is on a downturn right now, when would be a good time to buy in?
When BTC hits $3k
i'm currently holding in BCC/BCH, but if you wanna start try buying ETH and either hold it or try day trading alt coinsbut you'll end up losing most your money anyway.
