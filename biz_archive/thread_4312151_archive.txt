Elliptic curve cryptography and get him interested in cypherpunk then explain how Central Banks are cancer.

I would have a chat with them, spanning over the course of a week.
I would tell them about to grow with their money.
Not to spend it on hot wheels or vidya, not at first.
Some basic stuff that would prevent rebellious teenage years (hopefully).
And then the trading advice.
I'd explain to them as best as I can the complex shit I'm about to impart on them.
Basically this: >When you hear about something called 'Bitcoin', do not ignore it, look into it, see how you can get as many as you can, you'll start hearing about it between the years 2010 and 2013.
I know they'll be worthless when you first have them but that's okay.
You gonna hear some news, people are gonna say it's dangerous and evil, only used by hackers on something called the 'deepweb', that'll be true at the time but it doesn't mean you can't have any.
Ignore everyone who calls you stupid for having them, you will soon prove them wrong.
Hold the bitcoin as long as you can, for many years, you'll begin to see their value rise to millions upon millions of dollars, but whatever you do, do not touch them I don't care if their value never rises (but it will).
Then, around November 2017, sell every last one, every last one.
Buy something called "Bitcoin Cash".

When you make it, treat mom and dad with a nice house, pay off your debts, put whatever you don't use back into the market or entrust it with a stock broker, make a will, use the money to follow your passions, and just relax for the rest of your life.
and don't waste it away on stupid shit.
lmao fuck that.
i'd tell ten year old me to buy a fuckton of btc when it was at less than a dollar and tell him that everyone in this world is a rotten piece of shit that doesn't give a fuck about you unless than can stand to gain something from it.
