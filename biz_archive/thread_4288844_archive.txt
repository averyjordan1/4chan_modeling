The way I see it, this coin is pretty undervalued right now.
Involved developers, community, asic resistant and still mineable, and you can actually purchase things with it, unlike a lot of other coins.
I'd recommend at least holding on to it for the peaks weve been seeing every month or so.
Its made me a few hundred dollars here and there.
I'll buy back at 48k like last time
here man https://discord.gg/bxDmkY watch this in case they pump vtc today, they're talking about it.
Buy in if you hear they are, youll make some gains.
When does it stop bleeding you think?
Want to get into this coin.
I'm a VTC maximalist.
I think this coin is great.
Not to shill, but it's just a good, straight up, honest coin.
Great long term hold but also a great day trading coin.
I got in at like 60k and im happy with it, i see it hitting 10$ soon with upcoming halving
