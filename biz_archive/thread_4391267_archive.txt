Kek, those faggots still pop up here once in a while trying to shill elix
My heaviest bag is bitcoin cash.
Bought in over 2k.
It will be back to those levels though.
I am sure of that.
still holdingah, like clockworkyou will sell you know.
after you have lost 95%
Of course, You can't just ram a dick in, you have to work it in.
And once the dick fully penetrates it just makes it easier to go in again later on, never fully closing up.
I don't keep bags.
Selling at loss is better than wasting opportunity.
t. someone who sold bitcoin at 5k
I don't care for usd.
Only amount of btc matters.
