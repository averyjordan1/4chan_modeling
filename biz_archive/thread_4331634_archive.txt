Alright.I've been spending the past few days getting shit off faucets and now I have pic related.
It's literally pocket change, but I can practice with it.
What's a good place to start with this cryptocurrency shit?I've been reading /biz/ for the past few days and I can't tell if people here are genuinely trying to help each other or not.
Plus I can't tell if people are just manipulating others into pumping their own coins up or not.
1. do your own research2.
dont ask the pajeets on here what you should do 3. read a book, idiot4.
kill yourself.
JUST
bump
: Well that's what I am asking.
Where do I do research on?
Is there a specific site that people use for this shit?
Or do I just literally go onto a coin's site and read up on their development map?2: Ok3: What books?4: Thought about it
place a little bit into each of these coins:arkdigibytechainlink
Coinexchange doesn't have ark or chainlink.
I'm thinking about moving sites because coinexchange feels like shit.
I just don't feel like putting my ssn into coinbase.
There are a lot of shills here, very few of them are giving actual advice.
Unfortunately reddit will give you better information for starting out, data dash on YouTube does some great tutorials as well.
It looks like Digibyte is making some big announcement Wednesday.
So maybe I should just invest in that and wait and see?
Bro, with that little coinage you will not even be able to place a minimum order, sorry kiddo.
