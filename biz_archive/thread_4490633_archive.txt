With the launch of the first atomic swap between Litecoin and Bitcoin this month, it’s only a matter of time before this cryptocurrency could start seeing an extreme level of mainstream adoption.
With the current transaction costs of Bitcoin getting more and more expensive, this way of transacting between the two currencies is a revolutionary way of getting the best of both worlds between the two coins.Litecoin is a coin that is able to be sent and received extremely fast.
At the “speed of light”.
Litecoin runs on the Lightning Network.
Lightning Network technology creates a few new opportunities when it comes to cross-chain atomic swaps.
For one, the Lightning Network boasts a special payment type referred to as Hashed Timelocked Contracts.
They allow Lightning payments and even atomic swaps to be performed in a very different manner from regular on-chain swaps.
These contracts allow any party to cash out at any time as long as they broadcast their swap commitment transactions to the blockchain.
