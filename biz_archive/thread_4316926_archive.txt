You wanna make it out of this thing alive?
Hold a 50/50 split in BTC/BCH, this should already be the case if you didn't cave like a fucking retard and dump your BCH the moment you got it.
We are all being played like the peasants right now by the filthy mega rich.
We probably won't have a good idea of which of these coins will actually die until well into 2018.
It is all speculative bullshit so don't take any chances and whatever you do, do not commit 100% to one or the other.Also make sure you are holding Monero, NEO, and IOTA
Or, you know, just buy (t)ether(300usd)

>case if you didn't cave like a fucking retard and dump your BCH the moment you got it.
I did this, just as /biz/ told me to.They said BCH is worthless shit.
This was the general consensus until last week.
Wise frog indeed, I've took your advice as bitcoin cash worked its way back up slightly over what I bought it for.
It seems right now its struggling around the 0.3 mark so hedging my bets so I can relax is a great idea
I'm not to blame because I went with the herdOK keep that attitude in life
Where do I buy BCH?
