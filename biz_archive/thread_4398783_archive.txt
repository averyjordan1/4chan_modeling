I've been debating whether or not to help altcoin holders.
See, I currently hold alt pins myself and have been getting JUST'd.
If I sell my alt coins and buy bitcoin, then bitcoin will crash and alts will skyrocket.
But if I keep my Alts bitcoin will continue to grow until my portfolio is zero.
Either way I lose, but I hold /biz/'s destiny in my hands so I ask you now /biz/:What do you want?
buy BTC
