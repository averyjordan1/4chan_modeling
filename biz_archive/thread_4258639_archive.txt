I just bought this jacket with my crypto earnings.
jealous?
did you rob a homeless crust punk for this jacket?
Terrible choice, and this is coming from someone who used to be a homeless punk runaway
looks like something a junkie would wear
Im glad you got help anon...I feel bad for the mentally ill homeless but not the mentally ill homeless punks
OP you could just buy a cheap military surplus jacket and ruin it with sharpie if you wanted that
Guys can you help a newfag here?
I'd like to convert my ltc to btc on bittrex, but how would i do it so i have more value in btc then i did previously in ltc?
Looks like shit.
You have fucking terrible taste.
This bummy shit is expensive?
Now I'll check the pockets of these faggots after giving them a beat down instead of just whipping my dick out and pissing on them

You can't, idiot.
>opposition to capitalism becomes a commodified subculture of capitalismlol
You better live in a major city, NY, LA, etc.
or you will come off as homeless to almost everyone.
cringe
shitty ugly jacket - sorry bro.
Alpha Industries actually makes some decent jackets, but that specific one is shit.
Ron Paul should sue the shit out of this admittedly hilarious jacket's purveyors for that revolution logo
I would point and laugh at you in public.
I love how most people who end up making it with crypto have terrible taste, and will be broke faster than you can say decentralized cryptocurrency exchange
