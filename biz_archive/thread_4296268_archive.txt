this guy gets it
big fan of the company and it's initiatives but i don't see how they will be able to deploy it worldwide when banks could leverage their political capital against Ripio's network growth in foreign territories.their business model is highly contingent on localization and growth of co-signers; after all their value proposition is that of an agent that can absorb losses arising from default.
so i think in the beginning it'll come out as a novel success but definitely sell after making mongoloid returns.
Fuck off fake weights
you seem smart im just a pajeet, whats the difference between this and salt and what will bring more gains
I hold both but what should i accumulate more of
One BILLION token supplym circulating Don't see it increasing in value much desu Also >Crypto all about decentralisation >Ripio is all about working to the banks Nah.
Not worth an investment imo
Any of my salt bros feeling comfy knowing this knockoff posses no threat?
Stay poor
This is going to dip down to 1500 sats looking at the charts but I fully expect x`10 by end of the year.
