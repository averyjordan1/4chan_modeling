I don't expect BCH to take over but riding the wave is fun!Also, I got some live footage of whales pumping while I was watching the volume

How long this gonna go on for?
And is not just bcc pumping... btc gets dumped right before a bcc pump.. then vice versa
was so close to buying at $870 and riding the wave up, whens the next dip?
Good job op, now repeat this 30 times and you got 1k
Probably a week.
check www.fork.lol/pow/hashrate and compare it to BCC-BTC pricedunno, could dip or rise right now 0.135-0.17 I thinkyour're a poorfag too?
I'm also in some other coins just broke 1k :)
