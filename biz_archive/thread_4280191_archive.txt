Whitepaper revision coming in a few days.Not on any major exchanges yet.Sentiment is that its the next WTC/NEOUnlike NEO, people in China like it and use itHuge partnershipsChain release in 4 monthsOP, why are you not in NULS?
Because it was a coordinated PnD that's gonna dump any second now
Nuls is the next great moon mission.
I was in NULS and got about 40% profit.
Traded it for BTC then the BTC for BCH.
I am uncertain on NULS.
I made one of the original threads the morning after the first one (NO I am not whale OP) because whale OPs thread was amazing to me but I caught it late.
Still on BCH now should I get back in NULS?
Original OP said 40000% this week.
If you're still bagholding this turd, you have until sunday to sell at a negligible loss.
That is a personal decision The chatter I'm hearing amoung many influencial people is that NULS will continue to rise, especially as it improves its team, communication, marketing.
It was suddenly propelled into the spotlight; I am giving them a chance to change some stuff.
Scammy sounding overpriced token.
What do you mean people like it and use it?
What's there to use there is no product you fking pajeet.
% of supply was airdropped to pajeetfor that reason, I'm out
If Github and Whitepaper FUD couldn't bring the price down, nothing can.
No volume on this anymore.
Time to leave with modest loss anon.
Twentya I fucked up again.
Bought Nuls at 16k sold at 11k.
Gibs BCH pls.
