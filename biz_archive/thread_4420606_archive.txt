Why does Bittrex suck so badly?
I havent been able to make any trades for two days..
Anyone else having the same issues?
Yeah it's only letting me use one of my computers and it's not my main one so I'm pissed.
Also I can't even look at order books or see the price half of the time
Same....
I can only look at my wallet slowly creep down to my initial investment.
I missed out on so many moves that I planned on doing.
Turned $400 into $645 in my first week of trading, and now I'm down to $520.My last experience with an exchange was Coin.mx, and I lost two BTC to those fucking scammers when the price was $200.Is there no such thing as a decent exchange?
