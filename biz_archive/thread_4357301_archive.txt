I get this doesn't mean someone bought 2:1 btc but seriously, why the fuck doesn't someone just edit this out??
Actually, ye someone bought for 2:1 just a very small amount to fuck with the graphs
there must have been a trade for that candle to exist guy
I don't like the truth>Order someone else to edit it out of history
