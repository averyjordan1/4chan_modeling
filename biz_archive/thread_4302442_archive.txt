What did they mean by this?
bittrex will lock/freeze your account for using privacy coins, they locked mine after deposting $25k worth of aeon, its now stolen.
thousands of people had the same issue, check out their twitter.
the government is leaning on them for some terrorism/money laundering fears.
any DEX currently worth trading on?
my wallet on bittrex is working
probably just normal maintenance, happens to coins every day on every exchange
This is true.
I don't hold any privacy coins currently, but I have traded a few in the past.
I have had my account disabled.
I have sent all photos for enhanced verification but have had no answer.
I am a US citizen in the United States with no criminal background and no political associations.
Adding to my comment.
I have never sent a privacy coin to or from my Bittrex account.
