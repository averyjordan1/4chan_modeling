So I just lost almost all my money on POT and I need to 8x to get my original investment.
Since the 8x coin days are over I decided to go gamble on bitmex.
There is one problem though.
How do I use this fucking site?
Bump
Read their documentation and try on testnet first https://testnet.bitmex.com/
This will go well.
Just deposited and I'm just fucking around.
Wtf does long and short mean??
Where do I withdraw to my mew?I just bought long bitcoin I'm guessing that's the smart choice?
Wtf is ROE?
And why is it -6% already?So many questions.
lmao
AHHAAHHAHAHAathanks for your money newfriend
The most important rule on BitMex is that you always do x100.
Everything less is unacceptable.
Enjoy all your sweet gains my friend!
powr has a solid foundation.
seems to be on a steady rise and rumors of a pump tonight.
set your limit sells at 9.5k sats
