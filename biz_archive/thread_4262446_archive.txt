I noticed that over the last few days I stopped caring about fiat prices.
All that matters are gains in BTC.
I don't care if my coins lose fiat value.
As long as my coins gain against BTC, all is fine.
Am I crypto pro now?
smart.
but you will realise that nothing really outpaces btc in the long run.
(at least most of the coins) which will lead to more stress in flipping and rebalancing your portfolio.
(to keep your btc or gain in btc)gl ;)
Monitoring BCH/BTC closely
Could you be any newer than this?
Seriously asking.
I am new.
Only started mid August.
