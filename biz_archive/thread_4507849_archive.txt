Godfucking dammit, i lost 120K verge.
No transaction to be seen.
Just *poof* gone.
Anyone up for a class action lawsuit against verge?
considering they advised us to use coinpouch, it being the safest wallet?
I transferred 90k just fine
lol vergens falling for a scammy scamcoin advising putting your scamcoins in scampouch AHAHAHAHHAA
I forgot to add that its coinpouch.
Coinpouch got hacked.
The XVG from every single user there was stolen today.
If you had XVG on coinpouch, then its all gone.
About 126 mil sitting in ONE account atm.
It seems those fucking idiots stored all private keys on their goddamn servers.
Verge is run by a single developer retard.
That guy is living the easy life because of retards like you.He funnels every x transactions on his network to his own personal account.
Then converts it to btc immediately.You got fucking scammed nerd.
well, for what it's worth... i allready contacted the cyber crime division.
They want me to come in and file charges tomorrow.
It seems to me they're taking it rather serious.
We'll see where this ends.
Fucking verge.
