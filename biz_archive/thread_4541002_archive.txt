Hey omise/biz/brosIs going all in on an ico a good idea?
I don't have a huge amount of btc so the only viable option seems to be finding a good ico, throwing everything at it and wait til moons.
Even confido,a literal scamcoin mooned x10 ico price.Do you have any success stories related to this to tell me?
Xoxo
Going all in is a gamble at best, and doing it on an ICO is pretty much stacking the odds against you.
Do some research and find a coin you think is undervalued and not a chinese scam.
Remember ICO is a trash bin you throw unwanted money in.
Sometimes a hobo rises his hand and gives you double.
How often you find this kind of trash bin?Think about it.
not a Chinese scamCoins mooning are btg and bchI agree with the rest, its a bit of a gamble just like everything crypto related
