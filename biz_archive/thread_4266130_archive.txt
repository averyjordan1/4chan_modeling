Do I have to put money into crypto via a mainstream Canadian exchange like Quadriga then transfer it into some other account that lets me buy/sell ALTS?
What are the top ALT exchanges to use that won't Scam me and have sufficient volume.
Pls help.
I wanna participate in all these moon missions.
Bittrex, eh.
Or poloniex
just buy bitcoin and send it to bittrex and/or binance

Please share experiences (or info that should be common knowledge but is not for a brainlet like me)
Don't use Polo you spaz.
It's fucking shit.
And they will fuck you the second you try to move anything.
Bittrex and Binance are good though.
Thank you sir.
Best currency to use to transfer funds in?
Eth?
Or are there better options?
I am a leaf fag too.
I would also like clarification on this.
Should you just use the one which is below perceived value now?
For example, Bitcoin is now?
4266189Generally speaking, you should figure out what you want to buy first.
Then, look at Coinmarketcap under the "markets" tab and determine which exchanges and currency pairs have the highest volume and liquidity for that coin.If a particular coin has decently liquid markets in both BTC and ETH, I'd go with ETH just because it's somewhat faster and cheaper to move the funds.
But it depends.
