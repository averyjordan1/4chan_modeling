Hello /biz/ long time no see...Anyone want to talk about industrial property?I am in California, and recently started looking for industrial property in my city, only to realize the nastiest/smallest lot in our industrial zone was more expensive per foot than my moms nice house, on top of the hill, with a view of the entire city/ocean per sq ft... and this the industrial property was one block away from our notorious homeless shelter.Well I want industrial property for porter potties, truck storage, and possibly propane truck delivery in the future.I also want to buy a cheap crane to swap my truck beds around, go from septic pumper to tow to propane.
