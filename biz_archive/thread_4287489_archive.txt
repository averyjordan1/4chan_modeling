yeah you could have won the lottery yesterday too, kill yourselves hindsight fags
You and literally every other fucking person
you'd lost everything today either wayits going to tank to ~1k sat
Don't kid yourselves, every single one of you would've sold after you doubled your money.
the universe is literally handing you a second chance, BCH, which will be BTC by the year end, is only $900
I hope he chokes on a tranny dick
I knew about bitcoins when you could mine them on a shitty PC and get few of them per day.
But I dismissed it as a scam...
I got in at 700$ last year, and bought more at 3000$ dip.
Let's be honest OP, you would have never bought it back then, or if you would you would sell it too early anyway.
However it is still not too late to get into bitcoin, just catch the next dip or regret it forever.
Know I would have bought them if I had money to spare but I was just a teen in 2011 and didn't have a jobI know it's literally every other person too, but I can find the chat I had with a m8 back then saying I'd buy a few hundred worth of bitcoin for kicks if I was working and him agreeing.Fuck this gay life, oh well.
>could have dumped a 100k inheritance in BTC back in januaryJUST
rtyou can buy zcash now but probably do not, same story
