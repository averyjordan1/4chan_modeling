Not many of you would of heard of LINDA but it's a project that was disbanded but now the team are working harder than ever to work on the project.About : Linda is a hybrid coin with more than 70% pure PoS block reward phase and 99% APR.
It comes with a masternode which ensures lightening fast secured transaction, multi wallets, encrypted messaging and stealth address for complete anonymity and you get 50% block reward for masternodes.Current price is 3 sats but I expect it to reach 15-20 sats within the week.Inb4 pajeet
>but now the team is working harder than ever for nowHoly shit.
Stop this meme.
Esper coin and Moon coin pulled the same shit in June.
They mooned 100% a bit, but are now down 99%.
No one gives a shit about small no name developers in crypto anymore
this coin mooned to like 15 sats and then died.
