Serious talk.
Do you see it eventually making to the top 3?
yup.
well, at least top 4 in the $10 billion+ club.
yes, if ICO's become legal across asian.
Unlikely.Chinese users aren't interested in it.
It's centralized.
We already have ethereum.
This recent marketing stunt is backfiring, which will leave investors sour for the short term.
Long term, NEO core isn't being actively developed, just CoZ.Mark my words: It will never get government approval.
Not the way we want to hear it, anyway.
NEO will continue to operate, but you can already see they're stretching out internationally.
It's the only way they can grow, but they'll also run into stiff competition.NEO was great when it was the chinese ethereum.
Unless China accepts it wholesale, it won't amount to much more than it has already accomplished.
Impressive, sure, but not top 3.
Chinese users aren't interested in it.this boring stupid FUD based on google searches>It's centralized.
yes, with a plan to slowly decentralize.
it's all in the white paper and roadmap.
there are already 2 nodes not controlled by the NEO team that have been voted for.
kys.
not entirely.
lack of interest in chinese crypto forums and among other investors.google is a terrible way to measure interest in china.
that would be stupid.
