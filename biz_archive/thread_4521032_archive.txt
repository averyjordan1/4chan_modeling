Bump.
Well they have Ned Stark as a developer..
It looks OK, but why would a webshop use this instead of something else aside from just stats?
If the enduring survival of BTC has taught us anything, it's that people apparently don't care about technical side of things.
I'm thinking of just mining it for the first week or so (I've got 8 GTX 1080Ti's), although the block reward is small so the coin would have to be worth a lot for this to be profitable.
