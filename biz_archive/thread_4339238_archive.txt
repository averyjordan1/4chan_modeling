Thanks for the free 33BTC I got from this ride
no proof -> larp
Dont need to proof my wealth.
I just love how you faggots get scam all over again and buy the top.
Then make some Wojak threads here
I'm annoyed that I slept through the 2.8K.
I only have one BCH but that still was a 4K TV which I slept through.
you do if you want people to take you seriously, otherwise you're just some larping faggot who held bch through the dip and just made a tiny bit of profit instead of selling at the top point.
buying useless material posessions instead of reinvesting and growing your wealth
It's a LARP until the screenshot.
Enjoy being poor.
Well, we are talking about could have would have.
I probably would have put it back into BTC after not being able to decide anyway.
COPING
4chan (granted, /biz/ is normier than the rest of 4chan, but still)>"don't need to prove"Pick one idiot.
Pick one.
Spotted the ATH buyer
Buyer of what?
A Chinese rip-off of BTC run by two sociopaths and supported by autistic skeleton men?
