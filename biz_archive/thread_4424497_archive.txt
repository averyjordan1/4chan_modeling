Your loss senpai
this is as official as it gets.
Don't try to help the pajeets, they are hopeless
it's annoying.
they lie about everything because they think...no one here makes the market for any coin.
who do they think they're manipulating?!
their nonsense doesn't affect the price.
some retard with $20 isn't going to buy now?
they're no accomplishing anything
Don't tease me.
Still holding my small stack from ICO.
That's not really the same though.
We know that kyber team has been in Korea for 2 weeks now and they have said they will be making announcments in the second half of november.
i know they look the same but they're different gooks.
Bancor is unironically better, and more unstoppable than Kyber
Like witb qtum?
20$ guaranteed right?
Like monero or zcash brother>not realizing qtum didn't pump due to china fud
Why do you say today?
Why not during the week?
So that you can buy low
Bought a bunch let's see what happens.
Overall the price seems stable af.
Like a Korean tether,
Also didn't vitalik support this project like he did with OMG or something?
Vitalik knows the best pumpanddumpers, he gonna take this shit to fucking Jupiter.
He already dumped his OmiseGO and Kyber Network coins for """""charity"""""
I mean he gonna pump it because he wouldn't want to attach his name to a failcoin.
He didn't sell kyber as far as I know
buy this shit you faggots money skelly sez its only a matter of time until it hits $5
Money skelly what?
money skeleton = vitalik = kyber advisor
Even without vitalik its a solid project.
Bithumb pump will be the cherry on top
i bought 109
Good job but I would buy more.I only have 3000 I feel like it's not enough
I know but I mean>skelly sez What does set mean
