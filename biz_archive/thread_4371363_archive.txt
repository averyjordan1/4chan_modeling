Can someone explain how GDAX is free?
I see a bunch of videos on youtube saying its free, but this url and pic related says there are fees.
I don't get how these fees work, can someone explain for an idiot how it's free?https://www.gdax.com/fees/BTC-USD
It says if you are a maker, your fee is zero.
If you are a taker it's between .1%-.3%.
