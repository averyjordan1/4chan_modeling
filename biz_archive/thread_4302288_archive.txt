Hey /biz/ I want to commit to a private crypto group for $200+/month.
So far the ones I found are Francis Hunt's (I can't find any info on how to get into his private base camp and he ignores me whenever I email him about it), Chris Dunn's (no info on past performance), Jenkinsrm's (seems like his predictions are always lacking and he's way too conservative), Bitcoin-Fund-Manager (fucked me on his POT signal).
Let me know if you subscribe to any or can recommend one.
