When you get JUST'D, just remember that it is apart of God's plan and He wouldn't put you through anything you can't handle.
Perhaps you haven't found your lambo coin because your faith in God is lacking.
Why not start up a conversation with Him.
He is always listening :^]
I like this thread.
I was in my quarters earlier today saying my daily prayers when I heard Him whisper into my ear "Buy eBoost" so I said unto Him "Excuse me for questioning your will, but why eBoost".
He replied "eBoost will 20-40x in the near future"Do with this what you will.
I am nothing but an Instrument of God spreading, a Vessel spreading the good news.
Many of us are destined to never become rich.
This is because God knows it will destroy you.
For your own good, you are denied worldly riches that will rot and destroy your soul, for eternal gain in the afterlife.
