Am I the only one that has lost faith in everything to do with bitcoin?
I want nothing to do with it.
I think this is a common sentiment and is only growing stronger.
Now is the time to move into alts (such as vtc) before the average investor has the same realisation, causing a mass exodus of anything bit related.
I wouldn't be suprised if the other top coins are also affected.
These are interesting times.
I'm here with ya bud.
Haven't sold a fucking thing amidst all this insanity and VTC is my largest hold right now.
> VTC is BTC 3.0
My man.
And its correcting itself too.
I suspect we will see a bit of a ramp up now/soon with people collecting profits from bcc and getting out asap before the inevitable crash
Yeah thats the pattern I've seen these days, 2X between BCH and VTC sequential pumps.
Good times.
shit guys i purchased vtc at $4 a few hours ago, am i fucked?
Pretty amazing really to see this many people being played like a fiddle by some big guys behind the scenes somewhere.
Lots of people are going to get burned, which is bad for the overall image of crypto
No way, the opposite of fucked.
Prepare for an upwards trend
pfft
I'm pretty anarcho-capitalist/libertarian but I think there's value in VERT, DASH, and GRS giving the finger to the Chinese Mining Monopoly in the coming months.
Fuck yes I'm holding VTC for the sole fact it is resistant to these greedy ASIC fuckers
there are plenty of faggots like you.
I see tears i your future.
