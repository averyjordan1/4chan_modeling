Taxes?
Yeah right.
How will they get me if I:1) buy btc from bitcoin atm2) transfer to something like neo3) free gas currency generated from nowhere 4) filter gas through some sketchy site back into btc 5) sell back to fiat through bitcoin atm
Can we turn this into a full-on avoiding taxes thread?
This is something I've been interested in for year.
Now that crypto is out of Big Brother's prying eyes, what can be done to keep what is rightfully ours?
buy bitcoins with cash, thats it.
All the Bitcoin ATMs Ive used require you to scan an ID and give them a bunch of contact information.
Worst case scenario, if the IRS goes after the bitcoin ATM company you sold through, somebody might be knocking on your door looking for some unpaid income tax.Otherwise, they're still too stupid to link you to anything you do on the blockchain.
I would recommend localbitcoins (although ive never used it), or selling to friends in cashInterested to hear about what other ideas people have.
So far my personal plan is just leaving the US...
you can buy fake IDs with bitcoin nowadays.
On the other hand having a lot of cash isn't worth a lot.
oh, and tumble through monero before you cash out...
ETH/BTC pairs will open in a couple of hours on coinexchange io.
This coin gives you petrol at a 1:1 ratio if you get in before Jan 1st.
Interesting shitcoin to possibly hold.
Honestly, the fact people are eating this up is pretty telling of crypto as a whole.
Sure as hell better than a casino I'll tell you that.fellow gamblers I challenge you to drop an eth, or a few, on it.
Good luck
So far my personal plan is just leaving the US...Me too for my country though they might get their shit together and at least have a simplified initial minus losses law before the time I leave.
