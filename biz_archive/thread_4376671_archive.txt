So if I were to cash out some of my stack to pay for taxes this year, wouldn't that current crypto -> fiat transaction create a new taxable event and create an infinite loop of taxable events and never-ending money owed?
I know crypto is treated similar to stocks so it can't be that difficult but I remain confused by all of this.
Yes.
Taxes in crypto are pants on head retarded and everyone knows it.
Not necessarily.
Depends on the cost basis of the coins you cashed out for fiat.
>Buy BTC for $1000>Trade for $7000 worth of ETH while ETH is $300>Now you owe $6000*0.25= $1500 (depends on tax bracket)>If you sell $1500 worth of those ETH for fiat right away while the price is $300, the capital gain for that sale will be 0 because the cost basis was the same.>If you sell when the price is $350, then you will realize a capital gain on selling the ETH and will have to cash out a little more to cover the tax.
wtf do we do then
The new tax event will go on next year's taxes.
Also, daytrade less.
Locking in gains also means locking in taxes.
At least if you hodl you can pay the long term rate after a year.
I don't daytrade.
But I bought ETH back in March and have been moving it around.
