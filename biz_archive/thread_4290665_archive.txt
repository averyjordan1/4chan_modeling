Is there a way to buy USDT or BTC/ETH with Paypal that is not Coinbase?
I have a way to do some arbitrage but I need a max fee of 1% or so on the purchase.
I can't use coinbase because I'm not in the US and their fees seem stupid anyway (4%)
Skrill or Virwox come to mind
I checked out Skrill a few months ago when I wanted to deposit into a betting site but their fees are pretty high too.
Will check out the other one.
I tried signing up directly to Tether (I know, I am new) and their process is a nightmare (is obvious verification to buy tethers from the company is reserved for insiders and big money) and their fees seem pretty low (if you could somehow get access to their service).A good idea might be either making a contact with a local ether/btc vendor and try to come to a better rate than from exchanges (specially if you can promise him high volume).
If he gets his ether/btc from exachanges, he probably won't be able to give you a better rate than from an exchange.
If he gets his crypto from illicit activity he might be able to give you a better rate.Another possible idea is finding someone that has access to lower fee'd USDT/crypto perhaps someone from another country or a semi insider in this circle.
Give him equity in your business etc and hope for the best.
Your chances might be slim since anyone that is in the inside is already an elite and enjoying record profits, but if you can think of any creative business that deal can benefit them and you, you might have an way in.
