What's quicker/less random way to get rich on?
Low marketcap coins on Cryptopia with an actual future or margin trading 100$ at 50-100x in the big coins?Or I could just fuck off and start mining amber till I find an ancient dinosaur egg.
bump, I'm also looking for some answers to this.
My stack is a little over $100k, and I wonder if margin is a safer bet.
