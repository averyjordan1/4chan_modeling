Inflation rate for BCH is anything you guys can imagine.
It's at 180%.
At max inflation should be around 110% where BTC is at.
When it crash, it will crash hard.
Guys eventually all these sweet money will come back to haunt you.
Really becareful.
Note that im a supporter of BCH.
But inflation rate need to be readjusted somehow.
One really big deep before flippening can really occur
BCH hard uncontentious fork in 2 days to remove EDA
Jihan pumps his coin when we are a while from difficulty readjustment so he can get miners to switch from BTC for profits and make it look like the original chain is dying.
Then the difficulty adjustment happens, BTC becomes more profitable again, and BCC bleeds out for months.
And the cycle continues.
Fuck what should I do?
Give back the $12k I just made?
Guess any inflation is better than what central banks are doing around the world, right?
It won't magically become more profitable if the prices continue to get closer
