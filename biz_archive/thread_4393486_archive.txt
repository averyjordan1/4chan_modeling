Waste a whole day on bizStill don't know which coin I should buy Shit is exhausting !
I'm just gonna get back in fiat and kill myself because obviously I will never bet on the right coin and make it.
Obviously bitcoin u dumbshit
First post best post.
Fucking this
Zencash but only if you like money.
I'm in the same boat as you.
Ended up just putting 80% in bitcoin for steady gains and then buying some link for the memes and a small chance at lambo.
Link pay not be the only option but with my poorfag portfolio it's pointless to diversify because I'll be left with like $50 per coin
