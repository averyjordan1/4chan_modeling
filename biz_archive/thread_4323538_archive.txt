Disregarding price, which coin(s) are the most useful?To me it seems like:- Litecoin or ETH: Move around various places with low fees, and everyone has themor- Monero: Can buy illegal shit while hiding your identity.
BUT MONERO IS NOT PRIVATE IT LEAKS IP ADDRESSES FUCK YOU BUY OUR COIN WITH TOR INTEGRATION FAG
No opinions?
I'd say ETH or Litecoin for the reasons you stated exactly, but I don't see a future in holding ETH.Disregarding price, definitely not BTC right now.
when the networks for LINK and REQ get rolled out they'll be pretty useful
Monero is the only useful coin, period.
You can use it to safely buy stuff online that you can't buy with fiat, and not worry about going to jail.
No other coin offers that.
