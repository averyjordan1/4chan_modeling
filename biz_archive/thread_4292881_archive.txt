You deserve everything you get.
You seriously broke the number one rule of investing
I remember I really lost hours to do it, because I had to recover the private key of an old wallet.dat that was in .wallet format (Multibit classic) and then get muh free money on Electrum.And the #1 rule I guess is not even "buy low sell high", "don't lose money" or those kind of shits but something like "know the value of what you have", am I right?
