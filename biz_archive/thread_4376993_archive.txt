How do I actually cash out from crypto?
Do I go to USDT>fiat or do I just buy gold with BTC or what?
Why is holding on a centralized exchange bad?
Is trading just the ability to predict and react to other peoples inability to accurately access value and therefore overreact?
cashing out>everBut really USDT is a joke and scam don't fuck either that.
If you need to cash out you sell like altcoin>Bitcoin>cash.
I recommend gdax as you probably already have a coinbase account.
If your worried about taxes and your in the US get a Canadian bank account and learn to cash out slow and under 10000 with very random amounts and you'll be fine.
Yes unless you to plan trade rapidly and often using a wallet is much safer than holding on a exchange.
I think you already know the answer
