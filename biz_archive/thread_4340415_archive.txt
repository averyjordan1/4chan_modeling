>just swing traded my 1700 REQ for 1845 REQ
Sounds like the equivalent of finding a quarter on the street and doubling your bankDamn you are poor
It wasn't always like this...
I was a strong proponent of the hodl club.
Decided to try swing trading a few days ago.
I've gone from 0.44 btc to 0.9 btc since.
I literally started on November 10t at noon and spend a couple hours a day on it.Either I'm incredibly lucky or holding is a complete meme
Holding is a meme, especially with valueless 'stocks'.
Make your money as quickly as possible then get out of crypto (also a meme).
are you a genius?
