Post yfw when coinbase announces they will be building a dex powered by 0x.
Maybe with gdax branding, maybe not.
Post yfw coinbase lists req tokens and allows you to buy various coins via a simple REQuest
no interest in dropping my 0x bags until their exchange opens for over a year.
It'll probably drop after open but i'll keep buying it cheap.
There are too many ways to gain the system if there's an alternative coin w/ its exchange.
I'm in the earliest retirement club.
>Have 109k REQ.
Holding until it does the 5 - 10x mission at the end of the year once its website releases.>Also have 1k OMG, currently holding till mid 2018 when they'll move all of their current customers over to their chain, validating billions of transactions.
>moving those 5 - 10x gains with REQ over to OMG before mid 2018>Will have over 7,000 OMG when it does its 5 - 10xI'm going to retire by the end of 2018.
