So, fellow /biz/raelis, apparently I got some TRON dropped a couple of days ago, but I have zero idea what it is.
What are your thoughts and opinions on it?
you got 1 dollar from binance please go and kill yourself
TRON now in the TOP 50Well duh.
The price per coin has been going down, but the circulating supply has been going up rapidly.
65 billion tokens in circulation?
L O fucking L.
HODL til $1.00.
It's a Chinese gaming token.
Thanks for the totally worthless post and stating the obvious.That's just some random .jpg I found.
Well, I'm obviously not going to sell something I got for free, when it's worth literally less than dirt, but as that other anon said it's fucking 65 billion circulating supply, can this thing go to 0.10$ let alone 1$?
