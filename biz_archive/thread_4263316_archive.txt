IS NULS DUMPING?
>buying a coin that went up 300% in one day>wondering why its going down
Currently st 0.94 cents.
Seems like profit taking to me.
>Buying a coin that already went up exponentially>Falling for the 'enter thread about coin X and get convinced that you must buy coin X' jumboI'm pissed I didn't get in on it before it hit $1 and even higher, but that doesn't mean I'll enter a thread and fall for "whales are accumulating!"
and other pathetic excuses that every thread about a coin has no matter what.
Don't buy mooned coins.
Set a goal and when it hits that goal THEN you buy it.
Dropped to $0.75, almost immediately sprang back to $0.90.
Looks bullish as fuck to me desu senpai
