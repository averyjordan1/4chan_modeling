If you had bought EA stock after they were voted "The Worst Company in America" your investment would be up by more than 378% today
been thinking about buying some vidya stocks, but aren't ea a shit company?how much money
tfw actually wanted to invest in EA a few years ago when /v/ voted them as worst company>tfw was a young little neet with no cash at the timeI hate EA but man I knew they were going back up and when they got that Star Wars game deal it was too late for me to buy.
best hope they never have a shitfest with DICE
oh wow 378% lmao
I'd feel filthy investing in EA, fuck that
>not investing in shitcoins that 100% daily
