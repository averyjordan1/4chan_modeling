BTC going to dump, alts are pumping.
Back to alts not btc.
The moment I heard btc isn't doing the fork I went and did a 100% btc to alt because I knew that would happen
WTF not doing the fork?I thought it was happening
nooop, btc will dump to 6k and lower, go alts now, maybe you don't want to buy into a pump then go teather
So explain this to a retard normie.
Btc decided to not go through with a fork that would have made it 100x better by speeding up transfer times etc.
and they're sticking with the same old shitty technology, leaving speculation on alts the best place to keep money?
They cancelled because something about concsous
