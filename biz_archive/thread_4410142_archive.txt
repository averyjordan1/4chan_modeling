It means that Link bagholders believe that everyone who's not as fucked as they are (aka don't own Link) constantly think about Link in fear that it might actually moon.
Aka the Link holders believe to live rent free in their heads.
I don't know what that is, I just look up rent free and see apartment listingsOk anon I feel bad so im going to explain it to you.
Its because Linkies want an apartment instead of a lambo because they are supposedly smart money.
Get it now anon?
That's not what it means
this is it
Yes it is.
Dont listen to the other fags OP, their explanations dont even fucking make sense.
People holding Link will never be Rent FreeThis is what Rent Free looks like.
being homeless is indeed free
people who don't buy the dips before the next market cycle either can't add 1+1 or have officially been completely brain washed by Blockstream
I'm even more confused now
That get
Ok that gave me a good laugh for the first time today so I'll give the actual explanation During the high time of LINK fud/shill threads (literally dozens of threads a day where people were either fudding or shilling link) some linkie told the fudders that they cant stop thinking about link and link is literally stuck in the nolinkies brain, hence we live in their heads rent-free
If I think about you all day you live rent free in my head.Cmon, it's not that hard guys.
It means they will be poor forever so living rent free in their parents basements.
What happens if bitcoin dies though, doesn't this thing become a paperweight?
