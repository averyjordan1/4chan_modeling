Best exchange site?
Im fairly new to crypto, and looking to buy B3.
Anything other than KrakenCoinbase is good for beginners but they have high fees and not a whole lot of altcoins (though you could just buy ltc or something them convert to another coin using ShapeShift).
what's up with kraken?
/10 times buy/sell transactions fail Poor customer serviceWebsite goes down oftenThe only things it has going for it are the low fees and lots of different cryptos
