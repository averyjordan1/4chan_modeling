uhhhhh, what is happen.is btc kill?
core is going to need to look for new employment soon, should have hoddled their btc lmao
Wait so 2x is still happening?
Giving out free coins still, but you're unlikely to be able to even do anything with them.
Still, free coins has already made the price move up 1% in 30 minutes.What it really means is btc withdrawals aren't possible for a few hours, although trading can continue as normal on gdax.
Realistically it won't go anywhere but a select few miners are trying to proceed with it.
This is literally nothing stopping a fork from happening even if just one fucking person wants to do it.
4406084are you guys fucking illiterate?
just read the statement.
its nothing.
everything is still happening, because why wouldn't someone do another fork?

4406201Also, nice photoshop.
anon wants to know what the implications are
yo that's not a shop, literal email I got from cuckbase.
you do know Gdax and Coinbase are the same company, right?
Lol retard
Your email says they're stopping buys/sells.
Mine says they're not interrupting trades.
Maybe I'm missing something but that sounds at odds.I am aware ... where have I confused the two.
Didn't get an email, is that cause I hold ETH
Yeah my account with ETH and LTC didnâ€™t get notified.
