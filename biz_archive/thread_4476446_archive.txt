With the increase in crackdowns on scam ICOs, I believe this one should be tracked down and brought to a legal council.>$25MM in ICO funds raised, has investors pay to run nodes with their own money and overall software broken>edited whitepaper without a formal announcement, specifically on mechanism to reward users.
Drastically lowered rate>gross negligence in using ICO funds for project development and lack of funding for intended usageHow would I go about presenting this to a legal representative?
This kind of abuse has to stop and the team should not make away with 25 million dollars (not even including node operation costs and funds taken from market buys)
Bump
I submitted this form to the SEC.
I encourage anyone else who has been affiliated with to do so as well to raise awareness.
I sold my ico bags like a month ago, fuck those guys, especially that wayne guy
Why you have to be such a whiny bitch?>save me SEC I bought these tokens and they wont moonMost ICOS ban Americans because of you faggots
this fucking guy is the worst
theres a difference between not mooning and raising 25 million dollars to run a ponzi scheme with broken software.
idk how closely you follow the project but users are expected to buy in to run nodes and are rewarded with more tierion.
That is a ponzi scheme.
this so fucking muchand also huge thank you !
i hope these fuckers , specially wayne and that fat man with glasses gets raped in jail
That was an obvious scam since day 1.
They copied the idea and the whole site from Civic and I was repeating this like in every Tierion thread.
Bamboozled, haha.
Been wondering about this coin.
Had 6600 of these and lost a third of my money when I sold during the dead cat bounce.
lmaoing at the anon I distinctly remember that had like 35k and was bragging about how he knows shit and how to make money.
