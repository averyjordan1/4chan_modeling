My portfolio is something like 60:40 LINK:ETHAvg Eth price was probably something like $30Avg Link price is probably around $0.17/$0.18Thank fuck I took a break from /biz/ and missed the initial LINK hype.
It's a great idea and I'd have kept buying up to $0.40 or whatever it went to.
It will definitely break this price soon enough but I got a load more link than I otherwise would haveI don't even care if LINK goes to zero, the signs are so good I could happily live with myself for being so boldly bullish.
However, I'd be pissed off if it went to the moon and I hadn't bought enough
bought 5k at around 40 cents.
was almost my entire stack but luckily 1eth in the POWR ico was more than enough to save me.
at this point ill just let them ride as a reminder to sell when i'm ahead

I bought at like 14 cents sold at 30ish, reinvested those profits back around 19 cents.
Iâ€™m not even worried about it.
