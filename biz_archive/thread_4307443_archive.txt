What is the quickest way to access my bitcoin wallet from years ago with just the 34 letter key?
I have no clients or backup files left
convert your private key into a hash and search directory.io for your wallet address.
You can search by private key, but not address.
electrum.orgyou can import a private key with it im pretty sure
Look up bitcoin wallet, type in your private key.
Done .

I don't remember how this worked.
I used to have multibit but it's no longer supported.
