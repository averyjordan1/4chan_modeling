Been looking at this for a while.
It was at .50 a while back and has been coasting around .20 for a while now.
Is this trash?
no it's a decent project.
Ideal time to buy desu.

Thank you brethren.
May we get rich together.
It will pump each time a new DEX launches.This year I'm expecting Ethfinex, Paradex and The 0cean.That said, it might do fuck all.
Probably won't go down though.
