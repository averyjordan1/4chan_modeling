Does Hiro make a profit off this site?
If not, how does he make his money?
How much do you think he payed for this site?
fbi paychecks to sell user info.
You can see ads on this site so yeah dummy
Also this.
The old fat moot said on reddit that he gave a lot of users info to the FBI.
what was the reason moot left ?
Gamergate and the fappening happened around the same time, and both brought a ton of negative press attention to 4chan, and moot had had enough.
He left, took some ballroom dancing and cooking classes, and got a job at Google.
If he didn't make money off this shithole he wouldn't own it to begin with, whatever he publicly says is a different matter.In fact he's making lambo cash datamining alt-righters, potential shooters and pedophiles
Google owns 4chan and Hiro is just a front.
Isnt it strange that Moot went to work for google right after he sold 4chan but no one knows what he does?
wew laddy he works at google nowlmao
I wonder if they hate him for helping to create the "toxic" internet culture they hate so much.
Selling user info.
It's what he's known for.
What coin is this?
toxicthey should be thankfull for all the fucking banter 4chan created over the yearsdo you see this shit from Leddit ?
lmao no
he doesnt use adblock or brave browser.
Gookmoot doesnt earn a dime from me.
He makes a fraction of a cent for ever Google captcha you monkeys complete
this cant be real lol
they were probably angry at him right up until some madman emailed them the picture of him in the skirt.
now he's untouchable.
