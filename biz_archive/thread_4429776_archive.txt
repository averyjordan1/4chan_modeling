is it time?
Well, it's definitely going up.Super oversold and Bitcoin going down.But, NEO might be taking its attention right now.It's probably one of the greatest ROI coins right now but might take a couple days.
i made an ok profit on neo and then exited last night.
its up so high.
is it worth going back in at this point?
Nah, I'd either wait for it to come down and buy a significant dip or take your profits and put it in something thats undervalued (like Factom).It's not that it can't go up still, it's just that since it's already gone up 100%, the risk/reward is now off.
