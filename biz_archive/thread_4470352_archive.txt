I'm thinking of going x3 long on ETH once it breaks $390 ATH.
Is that a good idea ?
Who's with me bros
no, i sold at 340
420$ is ATH, retardcoinmarketcap is terrible at tracking peak prices
ok I see that now.
I used bitfinex chart and looked at the wrong candle.
So is that a good idea to go long if we break $420 ?
No reason for it to rise in the future, the volume send extinguished.
Good idea, buy high sell low.
Nah the fud game is always strong here.
Jump in now and hold for the long term.
play a few grand for fun in the shitcoin tournament but keep the ETH
Rules1.
Buy low, sell high2.
Don't buy at ATH
I'm already in from $330, I don't know if I should take margin long position or just enjoy my safe gains from holding aloneif it manages to break the ATH it will be $500 in no time, you twat.
I'm thinking of going x3 long on ETH once it breaks $390 ATHWhy not invest now when it's at a lower price?
Am I missing something?>Inb4 technical analysis superstitious babble
