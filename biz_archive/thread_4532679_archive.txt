>new Bitcoin fork in ~10 hours>not very publicized outside of a Binance notification>looks much more promising than Bitcoin Gold>all of a sudden shitcoins and BCC and BTG start pumping like madIs this just a ploy to rob people of their Bitcoin before this next fork?
I think Bitcoin Diamond could be big.
Futures have it going at $35 a coin and you get 10 Bitcoin Diamond per Bitcoin.
Pretty soon the entire front page of trading sites will be Bitcoin forks if this bullshit keeps up
bcc started 2 days ago.things dont start pumping just when you notice it
Another fork I can make free money on?Holy shit this is so dumb but I'll take it
Bullshit, it's been floating around .12-.16 up until late last night, who are you trying to fool?
It's another scamfork.
It's easier to get into exchanges if you fork Bitcoin.
is the mastermind and a bitcoin god.
Bitcoin Diamond is Satoshi's true vision.
Probably yes
