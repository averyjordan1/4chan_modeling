Why so much checking?Buy cryptos.
I hadn't invested so much this year because I have been busy at work so salary just accumulated.
I should have at least transferred it to my high yield (haha) savings account.

I'm genuinly asking.
What is your net worth /biz/?Net worth is assets minus liabilities, broheim.
Net worth is assets minus liabilities, broheim.Bruh, 0 credit card debt, 0 student loans, 0, business loans, 0 mortgage.
In many cases, you can get a passive stock market index in a 401k.
Combine this with the tax advantage, it the returns are quite impressive.
Definitely consider putting some more in it (but your right, you do lose the flexibility to potentially invest in higher returning assets)

13k Cryptos7k Pension fund (can withdraw for property purchasing)22 still an accounting student for 6 months and only on 32k a year but aiming for 250k when im 30 being realistic.
Not wanting to take too many risks with cryptos anymore since my initial investment is only 2.5k.
But holding btc and buying good opportunitues.
Any of you guys who think Bitcoins rise is over are fools and continue the biz tradition of buy high sell low.
Ill buy your cheap bags and hodl till bitcoin hits 30k.
Bitcoin is the face for the digital currency revolution so give it time and zoom out.
Hodl and buy the dips and we will all be ok. Fuds hurt us all.
550k trustAnd I have no idea what to do with it
