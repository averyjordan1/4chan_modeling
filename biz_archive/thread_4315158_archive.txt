This market is fucking dildos
Yeah, this fucking BCH horseshit just shows how irrational and immature the cyrpto market is.I haven't even logged into my accounts with this BCH crap going on.
I can't be bothered.
I didn't think anything would be funnier than Nov 8th 2016.This is so much better
I didn't touch bch at any moment, even I could have made some mad gains, I preferred to stay with btc and wait for the dip, but man, what the hell...
It's going back up already.I didn't touch it either.
I'm enjoying the ride.
Losing is fun.
Who needs drugs.
We can watch crypto charts.
BCH is what's necessary.
Core will not scale Bitcoin.
They opposed 2X which was a VERY MILD blocksize increase.I'm keeping equal shares of both, but rooting for BCH.
the fact that you chose btc over bch shows what an utter fucking irrational retard you are
wathcing two fucking nuiimbers go up and down and some lines is more exciting than any fucking sport or game or movie
Lives were changed today.
It makes it worth wasting my life on this site.
Everything's bouncing around like a fucking pinball right now.
I'm just gonna sit tight for a bit.
