Bitbay claims yet another portion of victims...
CAW!
Today I was using Bitbay for their faucet (100 free BAY).
Whoever runs that thing must be pretty dumb because instead of listing 100 BAY, he listed $100 worth of BAY.
So I used it and got nearly 2080 BAY for free.And then people dumped more so it's worth like $90 now.

It's an item on their marketplace, so you need to download the client.

"b-b-but you can have private markets anon, please, we promise it's decentralized, just don't research too much and just buy..." private markets!
surely the feds will never be able to look for these markets, or infiltrate the moderation team.
having a moderation team is decentralization, don't you get it anons?
please buy
I made money on bay riding the wave up in 2 winning trades.
Although I did have a small loss on the way down because I thought the new downtrend was a dip
