I just realized something.
POWR is the PBC pick.SLR coin is an absolute shit coin with no use or following.
The only reason it would moon is because King pajeet scam artist Teeka and his boiler room retards pump and dump it.Powr is the one that's leading the charge.
SLR's "MIT" website is fake as fuck, just like the Litecoin "MIT" website that gave it a lot of undeserved attention.If Teeka Pajeeka knows anything, he will pick POWR which should bring us to $2 tomorrow.
If he picks SLR then he is a fucking scam artist.Either way, the future is POWR.
Nice FUD, just bought 100k :).
This is MIT's website and it mentions solarcoin:http://dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/15.998_solar.pdf
King pajeet can buy your wife/crush/gf and mom and shit on them, thats how much scam power he has over you
that is not MIT's website.
Any student or faculty member can make a .mit.edu website.
Hence the litecoin site you fucking idiot.

http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/whats-happening-with-the-digital-currency-initiativeliterally mentions nothing about SLR, nice trips though faggot, completely wasted.
I imagine you'll say this isn't MIT's also?https://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/media-lab-digital-currency-initiative
"digital currency initiative" is MIT.
That's my point.
dci.mit.edu is all MIT
Didn't read, OPbut GOD DAMN I want to impregnate her
4467064AHHAHHAHAHA holy shit, thank you for sharing that with me.
Now I KNOW FOR A FACT Solar isn't associated with MIT.
All that "article" says about solar is that it's an existing energy currency to reenforce the article's point that energy currencies can exist.
LOL.You sure are extracting a lot from nothing.
Learn to read faggot
Yes thank you very much.
Solarcoin was mentioned on the MIT website, thus confirming that there is some "connection" between solarcoin and MIT.
Teeka never went into depth about this.
But the connection exists.
