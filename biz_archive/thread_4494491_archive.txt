finally reliaved from Reqed, sold all my req and bought 1000 xzc for master node.
current reward is 45 xzc, with current rate 1450$, once master node release next week price may bump above 50$, which is 2.5k.
feels good man, I done with stressful moon mission chasing.
this passive income I will put back to crypto again.
Anyone wanna bet it is going to be delayed
thats fine as long delay is not much.
but based on their track record, I expect they release by mid dec 10.
fuck idk if i should sell my req
How do you calculate the profits?
So I need $33k for a masternode?
last week it was just 12k, now price jumped to 33s, it will pump hard next two weeks.
xzc per month per master node.
so with current price 45x32= aprox 1400$.
once master node goes live, price pump hard lets say 60$, that is 45x60.
so the math.
this is more superior to zcash.
imagine it gains half of zcash mcap, which is 100$ per xzc.
WHY COULDNT THIS HAPPEN TO OBSIDIAN THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY MOON MISSION
not that I did not like req, but I dont have fait to buy zcoin, + I cant take the stress any more with this crypto fuck.
so my plan is just get zoin master node, every month profits put it in crypto.
likely I buy back req in couple of months.
nodes at $1400 per node per month costs $1.4M.
Who's going to cover that?
User tx fees?
it's how new coins are created into supply, like pow.
probably splits pow rewards or similar
coin is POW/POS Hybrid.Masternodes run POS and do not require powerful Machines to run but you will nees 1k XZC as collaral.Pow will continue as previouslt specified
by next week you may need 50k for master node, but reward also increase if price increase.
lately I fucked up with late night/ stress, lost some money in chasing.
I am done with that shit.
I will put back this passive income in crypto instead of chasing, 90% my chases end up even or loss.
so the stress is not worth it.
