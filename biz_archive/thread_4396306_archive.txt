You just got baited into the POWR scam.If you are not in some kind of pnd group, stop trying to daytrade.

Had a nice little trading stack and fun ked up by fomoing into Ripple and Confido :(
FOMO is the worst thing, and they know it, so that's why it works.
Bump, because the shillers are still going and people are still falling for it.
How can this scamcoin have a market cap of $9billion when it has $0 revenue and no revenue prospect in the future 12 months.
chasing pnd's are different than actual tradingboth work, but you learn nothing of real trading if youre only looking for the big pumps
