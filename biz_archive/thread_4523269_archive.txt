Holy shit
So how do we jump on this gravy train
How the fuck do I transfer BTS from Binance to OpenLedger to buy this shit?
https://openledger.io/market/ZEPH_BTSSign up on openledger then send BTS from binance to your username that used to sign up for openledger.
I believe to a test tx to be sure anon.
Blessings of kek upon you
I have tried.
It has a hard stop on the Label field on Binance.
I'm lost.
I'm going to go get fat
nothing opens up in deposits/withdraw on open ledger
I get a withdraw address error
On OpenledgerAccount name = AddressPassword = Private key
And I can't buy BTS on OpenLedger unless I do whole values?
I can't buy .05 BTC/BTS?
Sorry for the myriad of questions.
Ive been messing with this since last night and nobody on the bitsharestalk forum replied
