I'm going to liquidate my ODN.
Where do I move my money now?
Was thinking COSS
Coss is fine
Is it gonna take me 3 days to move from odn to btc and then to coss?
Margin.
Call.

Metaverse is being aded to Binance and Bittrex soon.

Transferring Eth to Coss only takes a few minutes.
>selling odn before decembersure, miss the last breath of life
Come, become one of us COSSdressers
Nonbelievers don't deserve the gains.
Coss is a smart buy right now if you can buy a bunch.
I'm not sure the weekly payouts would be worth it unless you can grab 100k+ coss.
If you buy COSS, do it in ETH.
The spread/volume is god awful in BTC.
I'm also selling ODN.
They are relaunching Dec 1st and on xmas they'll launch their app.
So there will be a huge sell on the news, better get out now.
They probably create a lot of marketing buzz around these events, and people don't like marketing, it's bed style and looks always needy.
That's why I'll dump my rest in the next days /s.
