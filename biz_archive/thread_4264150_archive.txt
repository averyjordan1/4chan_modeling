I just randomly got $0.47 AUD in GAS in my exchange wallet.I'm only holding DOGE, Verge, and Power Ledger.
Coinspot exchange.
Briefly had Monero also today.
Where did the $0.50 come from?
did you ever hold neo?
.47$ = 0.50$?
someone fucked up a transaction
They're dividends
Rounding.But from what?
?
