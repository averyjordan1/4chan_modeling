Is there any better longterm portfolio than BTC, XMR, and XRP?
Not memeing, I just can't imagine anything more secure and profitable.
Ark.
Ark.

no ETHwhat a fucking loser lol.
If you don't have ETH your portfolio is shit.
Simple.
Not Ark

Well you cant really buy in right now
NEO + OMG instead of xrp
If you want something a little riskier but still secure maybe Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash too
Unironically BTS or any decent DEX.

ETHNEO
Cloakcoin> Monero
Why ARK?
Can someone shill it for me properly?
It's a safe portfolio.
Profitable compared to a CD.
Lots of missed opportunity though and you will still wagecuck until age 65 with it.
Are you fucking kidding me?
ETH will be $1000 soon, almost certainly within the next 2 months or so.
You'd be an idiot not to buy in now.>You can't buy BTC above $100, that's just absurd.
no ETHthe state of this board
holding XRP, the coin that lost 50% in USD value this year, is comparable to a CDhahahahahahahahahahah you retarded fuck
thisfuck is wrong with you?also should have some NEOXRP should be at most 10% of your portfolioOP you suck at this
Ignore the SJW devs: IOTA.
IOTA AKBAR BROTHA!
THE INFIDELS WILL BURN!
not averaging with the other coins OP listedOh to have a simple mind like yours.
ETH and BTC are all you ever need OP.
Buy and hold for 5 years and get 10-100x your investment.
They're guaranteed money makers.
Blocknet is already working, heap of commits and building infrastructure.Iota is also fundamentaly a buy
Ark, seriously
I know Ark is a meme at this point but it's basically the ETH of 2018.
Great long term hold.

What if BCH wins?
I feel safer with ETH/XMR than I do with BTC right now.
