has anyone ever hit the jackpot on a btc faucet or are they hoaxes?
All hoaxes I think.
Hope is a great motivator, keeps people coming back to see the ads.
Legitimate operations like these will have a positive EV when the jackpot is high enough for games that normally only lose money like dice, combined with the free gibs you can get every 15 minutes it's only a matter of time.https://pastebin.com/Gi5DkFAP
whats best places to get gibs satoshis?i can watch ads all day.
https://pastebin.com/W6uwyiCtThe rest.Peanut Labs is the best earner on this site, they have dozens of crypto you can be paid out in.
Can also passively watch ads for shitcoins.
Dogecoin, Waves, Bitbean and a few other low fee ones are the most convenient to be paid out in then you can exchange them for whatever.A couple of other free schemey looking airdrops thrown in, I really don't know what to make of them but hey whatever, it just takes an email.
gmx.com offers free minimal signup info emails (no phone or verification) and it's the site satoshi himself used.
My favorite thing to do on that site is earn things before they appreciate in value.
Like if I had $100k right now to blow on crypto I know a bunch that will do just great in the next year, but I don't have $100k.
This gives me a way to accumulate that you can do while taking a shit if you want.
It's about as passive as poorfag income could possibly get until the human race reaches post scarcity through a massive die-off.My philosophy with this stuff is just to treat it like my addicted aunt treats stupid hidden object and deep-as-a-puddle town management games.
Just collect more meme points and sit on them, forget about them, loan a bunch out on various platforms, but just keep doing it passively with little effort expended and without stressing every day about charts and candles and crashes and moons.
