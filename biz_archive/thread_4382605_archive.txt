What will happen if I just never answer my phone or check my emails?
I don't really own anything other than my car which I was thinking about selling and ubering everywhere.
I live in NY parents Beach house and trade crypto for a job.
I don't care about my credit as I plan on paying cash for everything.
Can they fuck with me?
I feel like I'm unfuckable right now.
They might garnish your wages or tax returns at some point.
So if you dont have a normal job and if you dont get money back on taxes, the only other thing they can do is sue you if it looks like you have money in your bank account.
Hmm.
I guess ill stop checking my mail and answering the door.
Do you not fucking get it?
How stupid are you?
It's not really stupidity but I just don't want to pay.
My parents said they'd paid for it when I got the loans but I think that was if I got a job.
Seeing as I don't want a job I guess I'm stuck with it.
I should threaten them with a lawsuit!
I didn't want to go to college to anyways.
Just start getting paid in cash (that cannot be traced); save a bunch and use loans to finance living expenses.
Then file for bankruptcy (those living expenses you don't have to pay back are free living for 2-5 years).
You'll then have a stockpile of cash you can launder as profits and pay back your student loans after bankruptcy.
you'll get a great big WILLY in your BUM
You'll never be able to qualify for anything on credit like a house or even rent in most cases where they check your income/credit.You will get put in Check Systems with financial institutions and not be able to open a bank account.Lenders will just flat out not trust you.Troll or not, it's extremely stupid.
Hmm I suppose I'll just Airbnb instead of renting.
These fucks just can't keep up with this 21st century cyber punk lifestyle.
