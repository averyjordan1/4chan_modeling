We're getting cucked in so many layers because governments finds it easier to spend more (of the tax money) on spreading a 75% tax out in 6 different kinds of taxes than to have a simplified, efficient and less cumbersome to enforce one or two layers of taxation.Don't forget that we also pay sales tax when we finally decide to spend that money, and the corporations we buy from and the corporations we work for pass on their tax to us in higher product prices and lower wages.
By easier I mean easier to get people to accept it because people don't think of the overall big numbers when you put all these things together and actually believe "I am only getting taxed 35% on my paycheck so taxes aren't that big of a deal".

theres is no point in getting a job on welfare in the current system because of the way deductions work.
There are certain expenses that working can incur that the government doesnt think about, so its cheaper to sit at home and live frugally on welfare.
