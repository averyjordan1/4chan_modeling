Are you willing to admit yet that you were wrong?
Are you really going to sit there for 7 months while so many coins are mooning?
Linkies absolutely BTFO
I'm bad at trading and am emotional.
I know it's going to go at least 10X and it's only a matter of when.
I'm fine with waiting because trying to trade would literally just be me wasting money.
implying i can't trade other coins while also in LINK
same.
also technically as a burger I gotta claim every trade but it seems much easier to just hodl something I know is bound to moon

As soon as you sell your link, it will moon.Don't sell your link, keep accumulating.
Use a small portion of your stack to trade other coins and keep increasing your link stash.
