Disclaimer: I do NOT encourage FOMO.
Rushed decisions are usually bad.I posted last night that you should start acquiring ZEN, as TA looks very bullish and they have secure nodes release coming up soon (30th).We did have a nice dip to 275 level after I posted, which is great!
If you waited however, price is currently at 308-314, but the difference now is it looks ready to BREAK UP.If you don't care about this coin, no big deal, but if you want to acquire, now might be a good time with the breakout imminent.
We already know that when this coin does well, it does REALLY well fast.If it is your style, you can set stop losses at the 300 level, or you can just hold as this has a release coming up.
i need 42 for masternode no dip before 30th?
Could be a dip.
If so, Bitcoin correcting downward (or having another rally, but that looks less likely) will probably be the catalyst.Without a catalyst, I don't personally think we'll see 250+ levels for now, but in crypto anything can happen
I worded my last post a little poorly, so to clarify, I am not expecting a dip but with bitcoin acting bearish we might get one, depends on the timing.
As for what I did, I bought all the ZEN i want to now (as well as some last night) since I tihnk it is breaking up that is the only logical thing for me to doI will buy more if it dips (make sure not to use too much of your portfolio on initial buys to maintain flexibility)
I got my 42 zencash locked and loaded
