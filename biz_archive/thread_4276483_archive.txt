A few hours ago when eth was at its most recent peak, the price started dropping.
There were several buy orders for over $325 on my exchange, with around 60eth among the top 10 buy orders.
Then someone posts a sell order of 500 eth for $321 -- essentially ensuring the price never got above $321 again.
What the fuck?
Can someone explain what these high players are doing when they try to sway the market like that?
maybe someone was trading and hit their exit position?500 eth is fucking nothing btw, so definitely not a whale
