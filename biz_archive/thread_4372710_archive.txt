If you feel bad about missing the bitcoin dip you can always feel good about not investing in Ethereum since their dev team just came out as commies:>https://twitter.com/leashless/status/930563910679322629Vinay Gupta:>Gab should be apprehensive.
>We will not be good hosts.
Fork off!
Or use Secure Scuttlebutt or something, they're free speech fundamentalists I believe.
But not Ethereum.
We are all communists.
"Would you build on a protocol where leadership could hard fork you for hurting their feelings and having a frog logo?"
GAB:>Who would win?>A $32.5B digital currency or a bunch of cartoon frogs?
Vitalik reportedly made some weird comments about CP too.
We need to shill this shit.
We can make so much fucking money off them it's not even funny.Actually it's hilarious but that's besides the point.
We need meme makers pumping out tons of ProCommie/ETH content as much as possible.
Info graphics that show people how to buy and why.I was planning on doing this with RDD when it drops below 10 sats but this is a fucking goldmine opportunity with ETH that we cant pass up.
43727214372752Are you getting the feeling that no one cares yet?
Well you should be.
This actually makes me want to buy Ethereum more.
Thanks OP.

Hahahaha deal with it.
Soon to be a bagholder, I see
Either Trump-style PR move or lucky coincidence since ETH is about to moon.
I'm guessing it's a coincidence since the ethereum dev team is a bunch of autists.
About to moon.
Such fucking science.
Nice answer.
Vinya Gupta>"we"So tell me OP, what role exactly do you think he has within ethereum?
The only thing I can find is that he was on the team to help "smoothen" the release of ethereum years ago.
And by team I don't mean dev team, he was just playing support.
These comminiggers need to go.Send letters to the Ethereum Foundation and to members of the EEA saying you are worried by the leadership declaration of Ethereum after the declarations of the CEO.
