What do you think about this chart?
Anyone else here shorting oil right now?
they don't allow underage on real exchanges, so noprobably no one else here does that
Probably a good idea to do so, but i would keep a bit since the current situation with the saudis.it's sad to see 99% of biz threats about some shitcoin.. i understand talking about BTC and maybe ETH or BCH but there is a threat for every fucking coin now and it is shitting up the board
get this real world shit of my /coin/
Big supply area pushed it down before on the left.
Might be too early though.
5 waves on the daily, but you have to think they'll push it further and take out some stops.
