The road-map is a very crucial piece in any crypto project.
It keeps the devs focused on what needs to be done and investors can see where the project is heading to.
isnt there an entire reddit thread devoted to pointing out this is a scam coin?
Maybe I'm missing something
still waiting
A seemingly legit team kicked out the founder, who intended for it to be a PnD scamcoin.

There is very little Chancoin beings traded right now and the BUy orders have 3x TRIPPLED in the past few weeks.
HOLY SHIT
very little volume?finally there is almost 1 BTC worth of market depth
i was thinking of exchanging them to Monero or something desuI can see Chancoin reach 0,4$ but that's it.
Well, what I meant was that there is only 490,000 Chancoin left to buy on the exchange.
It is in low supply.
You can sell at $0.40, I am selling 25% at $1 mark.
Just get the fuck out the way with your bi-pedal when you hear an engine roaring.
fair enough
I'm not selling for a long time, until the devs have finished many of the things they're doing
Write your Chancoin wallet address in your name field to support the project.
You can get a quick online wallet address by joining the Chancoin Dsicord and tpying !addrWhen you post in Chancoin general threads with a Chancoinw wallet address in your name field, you will receive free Chancoins.
Can you do it, please?
How many coins per post?
Are you retarded on this.
Seriously.Whats the point of making one month rent money form chancoin?We HODL the fuck out man !!!
Lambo or no sells.
easy way to get some cheap chans , mine it with nicehash...
i am a whale... i aint selling.. if this project survives first 6 Months... then more to come.. We need more honest Devs joining ChanCoin Mission to create a new social web that stores his data into Blockchain.
Decentralized Forums.. and more...
chancoin is a ponzi scheme

since when does the wallet have that image of the coin on it?
I'm glad this site has it's own coin!
Looking out for more coins!
love this coin
What the actual fuck is this?
This is the most autistic thing I've ever seen.What exchange is it on, I only have ETH on binance right now and want to buy like $20 of this as painlessly as possible
BUY HIGH
Hiyoooo
No shut the fuck upI'm guessing the best way is to buy some LTC with my eth, transfer it to cryptopia and buy there, right?
Sounds gay but eh
This is a scam right?
Also I may be retarded but how can I mine this shit?
Is this even CPU/GPU minable?
I read about cloverhash so I really hope it's not an asic shitcoin
I'm wondering the same thing.
Confirmation times are horrible and I want to help speed it up, as well.
Chancoin goes for just 323 satoshi on Tradesatoshi, while 350 on Cryptopia
spicy as heck
its on cryptopia and tradesatoshi
im just here for the free coins
i wish to receive free money online no scam
Getting some good ass dollars from my friend on discord, future is looking good.
C H A N C O I N
Seriously, is this viable to mine on a gaming rig, and if so how the fuck do I do it?
I'm a /g/entooman so I'm allergic to discord

damn it i ment to say not really i tried running in a pool for 8 hours on a 1070 and got nada
That's kinda gay.
I'd hoped that being such a small meme I could actually meaningfully contribute.
its scrypt base, aka the same algorithm as bitcoin, the asic miners have control
coinz
gimme that chan
Nice wallet immediately flagged by virus scanners
someone kicked out scammer Gossamer?
when?
Hey, Andy here.
Going to dump 200k coins once the price rises a bit.
So if you are looking for cheap coins then Ill be able to provide them soon.
THE BLOCKCHAIN IS NOT MOVING FOR 5 HOURS
Thats pretty much every wallet or application that does what wallets do.
Get in the discord and ask this same question.
if i see you in there, i'll be happy to sell you a few coins to hodl or play with
wewewew
Trying to ditch your bags huh
nah, im a hobbyist and i dont see a reason to not sell you some.
I'll figure out a fair price and sell to whoever really.
I dont have much and i didnt buy my bags, i earned them by being in the community and stuff like that.
Chancoin is the /biz/ness.
The only mining pool we have is stealing all the hashpower

wait wat this coin is legit
