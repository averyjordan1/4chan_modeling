When will ETH be under 300 again ?
Never again..
It will also surpass BTC market cap next year
Looks like itâ€™s just uphill from here.
NoAlso no
that is literally bullshit and you know itwhy would ETH be worth 130 billion a year from now.
fuck ETH it's even more of a meme than bitcoin cash
When tether collapses and takes bitcoin with it, ETH might drop under $300 momentarily as well.Otherwise, it can only go up.
It's been trying to catch up to BTC for a while now.
It will hold over $400 by the end of the week
(ETH MC>BTC MC) =/= (ETH MC > 130 b)
For starters, BTC will be worth a lot more than 130 billion next year and ETH will be number one spot.
Sounds fucking crazy but this is crypto
Unironically never, just like BTC is never going below 1000 again.
