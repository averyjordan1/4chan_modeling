It has been brought to my attention in one of my crypto investment groups that there has been a back room deal between Waltonchain (WTC) and 5 major retailers that it set to be in full effect as soon as the block chain is released.
Because if the patents owned by WTC with regards to RFID tech, there’s no other way these retailers would be able to shop any competition as the execs have already voted and agreed to WTC tech.
Partially because the tech is legit but also due to the fact of a major voting bonus that has been paid out to them by an “anonymous” backer to secure their votes.
Word on the street is they were given in excess of 2m worth of various cryptos for their participation in the plan.
This backer already owns in the millions of WTC in various wallets.
Chances are if you’re planning to pack your bags for the moon, pack them quick and get them now sub 5 if you can then be sure you watch for the great Korean dump at the top of the hill.
Do not FOMO this one above 18 to be safe.
Target apparently is 22-24 for the first wave then a buy back at 12.
