>buttcoiners will defend this
Government can print thisVs>Government cannot print thisI wonder which one would be better for the average personReally makes you think
we're nearly at the point in history where it won't make sense to measure things in usd
this.
china's taking a run at it, and they're fucking chinks
if it doesn't even work to use for trade what's even the point.dinosaurcoin is living on borrowed time.
Can someone explain why if btc crashed the money wouldnt just flow to eth, xmr or whatever?Why would it crash the whole market?
Uh...OP, you are retarded
It would only crash in Fiat rate.
In BTC there is 3 scenarios :1.hodl like retard2.sell to usd(more likely to fake tether iou) 3.
Buy altsIf tether fails as platform , there will not be possible to trade to usd as most exchanges does not provide fiat/crypto pairs.
Panic induced traders will start to start buying alt to hedge loses, crating self fulfilling prophecy and creating second alt bull run
That would be good if your holding alts though, no?eth can easily be converted to fiat too, I'm basically speculating that if btc goes down eth would become the next go to normie crypto (because its worth the most) and stuff would continue much as normal.Am I worng?I'm just trying to get my head around the whole "if btc crashes it's the end of crypto" vibe I'm seeing here today

BTC is store of value.
The average person doesn't give a shit who printed it, as long as he can buy his fucking groceries.
You can spout bullshit about "digital gold" or "muh store of value" or anything else that doesn't appear in the whitepaper, but as a digital currency, bitcoin is completely unusable.
It's garbage.
The average person doesn't give a shit who printed it..but how much of it was printed and at what time.
Why do you think /biz/ is all up in tethers ass and people have been yelling for the federal reserve to be audited for ages?
