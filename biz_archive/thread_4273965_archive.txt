 I can actually agree.Tokens go up without an actual product...the more incentive the devs never finish said project.
Most of these tokens are cash grabs.
Autistic fuckers
Monero is superior to Bitcoin.

This.
Remember for most altcoins, you're basically a slavecuck making the person who made the coin and his team rich.
Pretty much every single altcoin I have looked at, roughly 50% or more of the total coins belong to the top 10 wallets.
Sometimes they belong in the top 100 wallets.Still that's pretty fucked up if there's like 50,000 wallets
You misspelled ARK, faggot
Those wallets are exchanges my man
Nooooo.
This is an incorrect assumption to make.
I've taken a close look at some of the top wallets in many coins and most of them do not move.
No transactions for months.Most wallets are actually labeled, and I would still say most of the coins are owned by whales.
One whale owns one huge address.
Altcoins are a zero sum game.They provide nothing new or valuable and everything they claim is a feature, is actually a design flaw.
Don't they siphon value from BTC, which is essentially just the black market and chink money laundering?
>Greatest transfer of wealth in the history of ever.
should i buy some ripple???
Bitcoin is the only crypto with a $5 transaction fee
People are in for a kick in the balls when they see BTC surprise everyone and keep going up.
Everyone thinks it's about to fall off the cliff, I doubt it
