Holding 20k REQ till q4 2018Hopefully end up on the moon
I kind of understand how it works, but i dont see where from token derives its value?
Why will it rise in price?
How long do I have to accumulate?
Should I get rid of my BCH bags now or can I wait till say, the end of the month?
Working product eoy so think for yourself
im about to buy $200 worth of REQ,hope it will moon next year.atleast, $0.1 better if $0.2thats the realistic price i can see for now
Their working product is by eoy so it could happen before the end of November, at which point I’d guess it’ll trade around $0.12-0.15.Personally, I try to buy 5-6k whenever it drops to around $.045-.05 which is where it’s at now.
don't understand its value PayPal trades around $75 on the JewMarket.
If you're getting in at any point under ICO you'll make it.
Just remember to take profits and not be married to the little Reqs.
Why not just buy it in one go?
Seems more simple to me
because you don't know how low it'll eventually drop if you're not fucking nostradamus
oh I usually just put one big buy order to where I predict it will drop the lowest and then sell it in one go at the highest peak.
Its more efficent this way
ah ok so you just buy it at the lowest point and sell it at the highest point?
nice, never thought of that
Read the white paper but it has token burn.
Meaning there will be less and less of them
works out for me...
buying low>selling highyou're in the wrong place for that m8
