>no whitepaper>chinkshit>shilled for no reason with stock reaction imagesYou deserved it
We need chinks to pump this
Whitelist is being released today desu senpai
its so hard to find any info about this coin or their team... their facebook links to a shady profile, I got in and made a quick 3x on this but I don't see why anyone would invest back into this given what little we know about it.
It's the inchain team.
FUD.White paper is in English on their website as of this morning.
Price is stable at .80 to .90.
Also, some of us bought at .30 or lower
it was a clear PnD shitcoin
source on this?
when I research inchain they're based in England where Nuls is based in Singapore.
buy high sell low again.
One Belt, One Road.
actually a pretty good coin, we will see another big spike tomorrow, maybe today, look at buy orders, there is serious accumulation movenemt.https://steemit.com/blockchain/@nuls/nuls-whitepaper-betav1-0
