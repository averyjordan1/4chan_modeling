Alright autists if you can break away from your BitcoinCash shilling for TEN SECONDS I have a ligitamate question.
I just bought 25k Enjin Coin.
I think it has huge potential and it's at a price where practically any poor fag can buy a ton with $50-$100.
Do you guys think this will succeed or did I just lose $400?
no
