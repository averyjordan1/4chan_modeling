I put in $46K into BTC when it was $5.9K.
Had nice gains just HODLing, and like a fag I made every mistake in the book.
FUD’d into BCH, FUD’d back into BTC, FOMO’d into a horrible crash, and now I’m left with 4.5 BTC from around 7.7 BTC.Idiot, I know.
FUD, FOMO, all eggs in one basket, day trading with no experience.
Every mistake in the book, when I should’ve just fucking HODL’d.
Any suggestions to just make it back to 7.7 BTC?
Besides kms, though that doesn’t sound too bad right now.Not looking for anything overnight, but at least making it back to where I was would make me feel like not such an idiot.Well, learned the hard way by going all in and making every mistake possible.
Any suggestions?

I lost 4BTC after Buttcoin Gold dumped hard on me.
I've mostly made it all back in the last two days though.
you've had enough time, let this anon in on the moon mission
Just hodl ETH and watch your money 20X every year
you'll recover eventually>suggestionswait until btc/bch debacle is over, then buy rdn/sub when they dip about 20-30% and hold through December
Learn TA, Learn market sentiments, Be alert to price changes, Invest in good coins.
Dont get meme'ed into coins.
Dont FOMO, Take profits
Just buy android HODL LINK
You fuckers have been accumulating for months.what is the problem with Cosstards?>investing in a shit binance>ignoring that DEX’s will take over in 2 yearsCoss is literally the worst investment OP needs to keep 3 Btc and put the rest into potential moons like REQ / LINK/ SUB
