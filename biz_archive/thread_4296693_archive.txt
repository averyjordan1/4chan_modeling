I've heard some Vanguard funds can bring pretty reliable returns of 10-15% annually, is that true?
if vanguard partnered with a coin i would put my life savings in it

A 4-fund portfolio is nice (Total stock market, Total international stock market, Total bond, Total international bond) and covers all your bases/properly adjusts your risk profile.
Bonus points if you have Admiral shares.
