Told anon about this like 2 weeks ago when it was like $.20 and now it's what's $.70 odd last time I checked?
?Biz likes to stay poor then post FMLs.
P.S can also be bought on ED, prefer that than the exchanges they're currently listed on
Currently $.62, so a nice time to hop on.Some additional infoThe Japanese are going nuts about Alis on twitter.They are especially impressed with how seethrough the team is and that their questions get answered by the CEO and other members of the team directly.
They are saying they have become fans of the project and are not planning on selling anytime soon.CEO will speak on an event organized by Business Insider Japan the 4th of December.People are planning on flying in from all over Japan in order to join the Alis meetup to be held next month.
I hate my life for buying bcc instead of this.
I can’t find the specific trello card anymore on the roadmap, but they have approached these exchanges in the past and “negotiating with exchanges” is still on On-going currently.
>pic related: the list of exchanges.
Had this in my photolibrary still.
True, so an easy 3x already in 7 days, my current bags are now just profit and I've reinvested my initial into ENJ which is going to explode soon so it's only green from here on for meYou're right about the team, most open and good communication via twitter, Japs love that.
They will adopt this no question and only time until the Koreans jump on board too then we're off
Good project but its up 300% in the last week, be aware biz its priced in
Not too late yet.
