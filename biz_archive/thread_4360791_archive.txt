Be less blatant about trying to trigger sentiment analysis bots, OP.

You should be.
Blockstream Coin's chain can easily die.
The real Bitcoin has more advanced DAA algorithm that makes chaindeath impossible.
Unless there's some radical change in prices, BCH will be the more profitable coin to mine very soon :)
