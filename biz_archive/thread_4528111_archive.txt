Ethereum will be $700.00 before the end of this month.
thanks just shorted 5000 ETH
Nice just lost 100k
Congrats on that, seriously.
It's probably going back to $300, just like the last time it hit $420, except faster.
Dead coin, next shill please
Those digits Trips
Nice just bought 100k
No-coiner jewfag detected.
could happen, this is nothing like last time though
Agreed OP im guessing $728 by the end of december.
Very undervalued coin.
Easily repeatedly hacked commie pedocoin with openly racist devs fuck it.
I've been saying this here for a few weeks now, since it hit $330, it was such an obvious moon mission, that I don't even know how anyone could miss it.
It's going to $800-$1k by january
Why aren't you openly racist and pedo if you're here?
just sold 15 ETH.
Will wait until tomorrow, seems like there is resistance at 425
It fucking better be.
ETH has never had a security problem you retarded fuck.
The people who make smart contracts on it are bad at coding smart contracts.When BTC has smart contracts you'll see the exact same security problems, because the problem has nothing to do with the coin.
hahahah its dumping why did I buy this shit
>hold ETH for 3 months straight without any mentionable shifts weeks ago "fuck this, i'll just sell it at 300 even and invest it in something else"
Do I sell?
Is it going to drop lower?
bought just shy of ath, holding and buying more at 300
What?
That makes no sense?
If you believe it's dipping to 300, wht not sell now then buy again when it dips?
Yeah why did you buy at an oath if you think it's going back at 300?I bought in at 366.
I just was wondering if I should sell and buy in again if it dips lower?
Or if it's going to go back to 425....should have sold at 425 but I thought we were on a moon mission
Just sold at 410.
I think it might dip for a few hours.
