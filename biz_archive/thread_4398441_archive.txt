Can someone explain Ripple?
Looking at this chart, if someone bought $1000 worth in Feb of this year it would be worth around $45000 today?????
Or am I missing something?>https://www.worldcoinindex.com/coin/ripple
Nigga I have 25k xrp I bought under 5 cents a pop.You ain’t missing shit.
XRP is probably the most FUD'd coin out there, so it was easy to miss.
There's no excuse to miss the next mooning, tho.
Xrp is going to be huge it’s just a sleeping giant right now
there are people who got in in September on /biz/ and people who have been in long before.
There's a shit ton of difference between their accounts right now.
fastest transactions, can handle more than visa and mastercard, tech is ready and used by banks
They just partnered with Amex
YeahAnd?
Sleeping giant>Top coin on CoinmarketcapLmao at you right now, everyone knows about ripple
Yet according to biz it's a scam and a shitcoin
Yeah, but it's still asleep.I'd invest now, you're going to get a good return (probably).Yet according to biz it's a scam and a shitcoinHas /biz/ ever said something wasn't a scam?
Look at any other chart anon.
April was when we made our money we are gambling away now
Thank you all for the replies.I'm too old for this shit.
Sticking with boring index ETFs for now.
Holy shit y'all are retarded... ripple is an okay long term hold, but if you want to cash out in the next year pick literally any other coin.
They could announce that God has chosen XRP to be the official currency of heaven and it would barely budge.
