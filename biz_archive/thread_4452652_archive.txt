I mean I didn't buy but wtf /biz/..Well at least you didn't relentlessly shill it here.
Its primed for mooning, man
That is the thing.
No matter how good or solid something appears.NEVER BUY INTO SOMETHING THAT WENT x20 WITHIN A MATTER OF DAYS YOU MORONS.Boy, I did endless FUD and discussions to save some of you assholes some money but nobody even wanted to listen.
Even without that legal piece there was simply no reason to buy before a correction
Kek'd at this.I hope this guy lost it all.
Well, now would be a comfy buyin I guess.
