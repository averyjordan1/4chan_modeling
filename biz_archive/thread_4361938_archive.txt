Am I getting goxxed or what?burger here, be trading BTC/BCH.
Have withdrawn 20+ BCH multiple times over the last few weeksbut suddenly since this weekend I've been unable to withdraw, it keeps saying I'm over my daily limit even though I haven't withdrawn anything.
I've tried withdrawing 10 bch for 3 days now but it won't go through
I have basic verification btw and have never had problems withdrawing up to 3BTC worth of crypto a day until nowalso I get auto-forwarded to the enhanced verification bullshit every time I login but I'd rather not do that at least until I get my money safely out
Send me a selfie bob sagget
why should I have to if I am still basic level account tho?
I should be able to w/d 3 BTC a day
also what else are they gonna want for enhanced?
selfie, id scan and utility bill or some shit like that?
