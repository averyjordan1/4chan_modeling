tfw deluded mETH heads are defending Vitalik's position with even worse arguments.
Pandora's box has been opened today
What's the context of this?
/BIZ has became /B?
ETH is fucking finished
Vitalik has so many big name partnerships in ethereum and he says shit like this on twitter.He's his own worse marketing nightmare ffs, he needs to contain his autism
>mfw companies start leaving the ethereum alliance because of vitalik autism
It's already too late imo.
You can never do shit like this as a public figure
