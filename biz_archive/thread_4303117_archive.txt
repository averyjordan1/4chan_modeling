You mean it just hit the $120 price it was a day or two ago?
people are finally waking up to the potential this has
Coinbase follows monero on twitter.
And they only followed btc, eth and ltc.
You mean it just hit the $120 price it was a day or two ago?you mean two days ago when btc was $1k more?
What monero wallet do you use?
What kind of argument is this, you don't need BTC to buy XMR
just the standard desktop one, takes a while to sync, but it's pretty good
If you set this you don't have to sync all the data yourself.
I'm aware, but thanks regardless
Monero is love
all fiat pairs are pumping son,its a prelude to the next alt wave
