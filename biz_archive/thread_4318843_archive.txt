So now that this shit fest is over what ALTs are you jumping into?I'm thinking ARK and LINK.
Req and Link.
I took big positions with my BCH profits on their dip today.
Feeling comfy
Are you fucking retarded?
Its just getting started.
already bought into Ark
You are retarded.
Bitcoin is whatever coinbase says bitcoin is.
Muh flippeningget out of my thread you cuck
You're not /biz/ if you dont have any LINK.
I fud constantly, but you'd be stupid not to have a little bit
buy req and link
Tempted on Req.. Not 100% sold on the way their token works though.Reckon 42k is a good buy?
I don't know, got 51k Link but totally lost hope already.
I can't even shill this anymore without having a bad conscience.
Why buy in now?
Bitcoins about to go back to 8k and alts will bleed.
k Ark...?
That's like $110,000 worth
Why would it do that?I feel you, I have 10k from 20 cents.
Should have sold at the top but averaging down isn't a bad idea right?
lol
k sats*
Ah, my bad.
I would try to get it at 40k if you can.
go all in on omg.
omg is already expanding their polish team as promised in the whitepaper.
they are going to actually release the wallet and dex in q1.
don't be an idiot and go get your easy 9x right now.
well, it depends if you are a sinner or not and if you heed father's warning.
I TRIED TO WARN THEM FATHERTHE FLOOD IS COMING
BAY, ETP, EMC2.
Its just getting started.
So now that this shit fest is overkek it hasnt even begun
Has fantastic resistance at 42.
It could potentially go down further, but I'm not sure.
I am sure that once the market stabilised it's going to stabilise over 50 though, at the very least.
So if you're looking short-mid term, go for it.
Anyone got a screenshot of that swift.smartcontract.com page that was up momentarily?
short term go in Salt, mooning in December coming
yep gonna be a big one.
