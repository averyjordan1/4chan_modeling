Maybe google first what you are going to buy.I can just tell you that 1$ in the next weeks is not impossible for that one.Oh and btw, today their RCN network goes live with an sleek app.
Why do you think this could hit $1 so soon?
I thought they weren't launching their main product until april?
Will their customers be able to start using the alpha that's coming today?
I'm not fudding, already bagholding this coin but it seems like more of a long term hold.
I would be happy if I'm wrong though.
Users from Argentina can start using the alpha once it is released today.
They are targeting Brazilian users soon after.
right, currently it will not be usable for everyone, but it will attract much attention if the site is live.
bros. look @ the depth
