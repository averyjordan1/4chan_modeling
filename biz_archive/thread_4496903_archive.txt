I am too autistic to figure this by myself.
BCH is supposedly trying to attack BTC during block difficulty adjustments.
What would change if they timed this with the halving of BTC mining reward?
read this thread 
skimmed.
nothing was mentioned about the reward halving.
if I missed it, link the actual post
You do realize that would require a fork, which would attack Bitcoin right?Holy fuck some people.
I am talking about the event when the bitcoin mining reward gets naturally halved.. it occurs like every 4 or so years
that's not necessary for chain death spiral, the exit of all btc hashrate because bch becomes exponentially more profitable to mine will kill btc
