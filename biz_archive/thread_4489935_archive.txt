Found the problem.
Coinbase always says go have a fuck when you send in coins from an exchange.
Coinbase is a really shitty site and are paranoid, I can see them getting shut down by the feds
Scenario hypothesis:Tech guy in customer support at bittrex sees your LTC go to coinbase address.Looks up your login and password on bittrexUses said login and password on Coinbase in attempt to hack your accountCoinbase sees suspicious activity and shuts it down.
