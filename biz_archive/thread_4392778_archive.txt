You're a fool if you're not buying now.
One of the best prices to buy in.It's an easy x2-3 coming
LOL more like zencrash.
I don't care about the coin I only care about money btw everything is crashing today but this coin is going to hardly rebound
More like zentrash.
Yeah I forgot the official strategy of /biz/ is buying high selling low.Then, you should have bought at 0.05 and sold right now
BTW it's good that biz is hating on this coin, otherwise I would have sold all my positions.Thanks boys your analysis are always working!At least, don't buy it at 0.008 when it pumps
Hope you're in if you bought when I've made this thread (295k) you're already making money.My sell point is around 335k
rather zcoin but bros
The secure nodes are going to pump this coin bro that's why I'm not in zcoin atm
Btw I've also made like 10 calls on this coin, this one is fucking easy to daytrade.
But /biz/ is always laughing at all my calls it's funny to see that.That's how you know this is a good coinI fucking like zencash for this reason!
