I would like to make a steady income with trading crypto but so far i've only made about .09 btc in the span of 3 months after investing about 0.9 btc.
What am I doing wrong?Should i hold or should i trade frequently?If I should day trade, how do i know if im at a dip or not?
what are the signs?Help a brainlet out thank you
that fine considering most people here lost 70% of their satoshiyoure doing fine dumb faggot
yeah but i wanna make enough to live off of so i can stop being a waiter
if you are a fembot, consider sucking dicks and invest those money into crypto instead.
trading small amount is hard to get a good profit, because you dont have much capital to diversify.
buy high sell lower
if you live with mommy and daddy just stay there and work your waiter job until you get fired
i dont
Duh, you need to have more money to do that.
Keep up this performance for the next year and you'll have almost 30 btc, that's about enough to start trading for a living.
