If I had only bought BTC in August, I would have 2 BTC, $14,000 in October.
If I exchanged that to BCH that would be let's say around 25-28 BCH....
Instead of this I have $2,000 in my wallet right now.
Well... fuck my life.
There's stocks that 20x literally every year retard.

I was going to, but now I feel better.
I could have been a millionaire by now, goy.
Why didn't I buy paraiba tourmaline in brazil in the 80s for pocket change??!!?!?!??

I am mostly angry with myself I guess.
I knew something was on, as soon as I've head Bitmain is only accepting BCH.
I've had 4 BCH earlier this week and foamosold when I've heard about 2x being cancelled.
WHY DIDN'T I GO BACK IN TIME AND PATENT THE LIGHTBULB!?!?!?!?!?!?
