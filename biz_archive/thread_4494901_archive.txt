this is the lowest bch will ever be
it's gonna move either straight down or straight up.
I'm all in, gambling for the latter.
I'm all in
if it doesn't move up crypto is dead, unlikely
Can you explain your memelines?
They don't even intersect the BCH price
brehs...lord give me strength
delusional bcash cucks LMAO I mean if you post it every single day i'm sure one day it will come true
wait what were we talking about again?
oh yeah, the way things have been going--a likely shallow dip to the mid .13's as BTC climbs to 8550ish with ETH testing 380.
and then a MASSIVE erection, i mean btc dip back down to 8k.
if it doesn't move up crypto is deadBTC will be okay friend
All that and she didn't manage to squeeze out even a turd.
I'm glad taking a shit for me isn't a tenth as bad as whatever she has.
I hope it moves up to 1600-1700 so btc will finally dip for me to buy
That's literally just a line drawn to the arbitrary corner of a chart tho
we have this thread everyday, I guess it's a meme now, just like LINK
