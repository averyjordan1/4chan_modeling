Coss.io is a crypto exchange just like binance/bittrex.
If you buy the exchange coin called COSS and hold it in Coss.io, you earn dividends which is just payouts from the fees people paid for trading on the exchange.The more coss you own the higher your payout.Dumbed down example: So if you were the only COSS holder, and someone sold 100 ARK on the exchange for a fee of 1 ARK, you would get paid 0.5 ARK.
If someone sold 100 BTC for a fee of .5 BTC, you would get .25 BTC.
WAIt so surely this is a nobrainer?
Pretty much.
The only problem is that the exchange is pretty new so there a ton of money being traded and thus the payouts are kind of small.
However it has recently grown to reach the top 100 exchanges.
For now, it is good that there is not much volume because COSS coins are dirt cheap, around $0.08.
Once it gains significant traction this shit will explode and the dividends will come flowing in, AND the exchange coin will increase increase in price as well.
Coss is a fucking scam u mouth-breathing neet.
You provided some good evidence in your post so I believe youJust sold all 150,000 of my COSS thanks to you, thanks man you really saved me
How exacly do the pay you after buying the COSS coin?
The coss.io exchange has a dashboard where they tell you exactly how the dividends were calculated, your payout for each week, your total payout, and the valuation in dollars.
You can then distribute them to your wallet by clicking a button
All in LISK.
