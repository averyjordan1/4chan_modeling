Digibyte fully completed its pump and dump cycle, and is now ready to begin a new one.
The joke of the community was never a bad coin.. that's the joke.
I know it's against biz protocol but if you want to experience the joy of buying low for once in your life, buy DGB now.

Holding 50k from 105 sats.Will i make it??
WARNING, PUMP AND DUMP IS IN EFFECT.
DO NOT BUY.
Lol as if u can manipulate such high volume
Digibyte was below 30 satoshis early in the year and can easily fall back to those levels again.
After the marketcap of crypto has gone up 150 billjon marketcap?
I doubt it.
100 sats was the bottom
Yea id still hold it dude, just based on the fact that it was worth many millions even before btc pumped +100 billion so its due to at least double unless BTC crashes back to like 2k..
