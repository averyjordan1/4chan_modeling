The current Chancoin is little more than a Litecoin clone with some very small changes (diff retarget time is 2 blocks, testnet min diff, etc).
Obviously, in order to actually provide features and usability for the coin, we need to change that.
Andy decided to fork a very old version of litecoin (0.8.7) which doesn’t even have the features we want, so we’re going to need to change that as well.The biggest point on our unannounced roadmap is updating Chancoin’s codebase to the latest version of Litecoin.
This will allow us to actually start doing stuff, and name has gotten a pretty good beta version working already - we just need to squash some bugs and that’s it.
Once we have the updated client, we can start working on real features, most notably, blockchain-based data storage and Cloverhash, our new mining algorithm.Cloverhash will solve many, many issues, most notably the complete domination of ASICs.
In the current chancoin mining scene, it’s practically impossible to get a block mined using a regular GPU.
Cloverhash, based on Dagger (the same mining algorithm that Ethereum, Zcash and many other coins use) and Lyra2RE (Vertcoin), makes it extremely easy for the end user to mine chancoins using their normal graphics cards and immensely helps with decentralization of the network.
who is actually making these threads?
Whats up with payouts from the mining platform?Im waiting on 4,8k appx4CHN to the moon tho
wtf u smoking
I am suspicious of you since you do not have a Chancoin wallet address in your ''name'' field.
I recommend joining the discord and going to the ''mining-help'' where you can find answers the quickest.
There you goNo suspicions bruh
It is still in alpha, afaik the payments have to be made manually.
Blockchain-based data storage is another very interesting feature we are exploring.
Using OP_RETURN and transaction metadata, we can store long strings of information on the blockchain, without any central server.
With this, we can then develop:- Tripcodes and usernames stored on the blockchain!
This eliminates the need for those huge ‘$4CHN:’ names on imageboards and allows us to link usernames on other websites (Twitch, Youtube, Twitter, etc) to a specific Chancoin address, which can then be sent coins to using the tripcodes stored on the blockchain.- A blockchain-based chan archive, in which users pay a certain amount of coins to upload a post to the blockchain, thus effectively archiving and storing it *forever*.- An imageboard, or forum, stored completely on the blockchain.
YEs its alpha.How manually.
There is no option to withrdraw yetI mined 4,8 k, so far got paid 184 coins.
bump!

You dont have to use it for tipping, use it to receive free money.

The buy walls are MASSIVE and they are many.
This means that the value of the coin wont drop below these numbers and it will go only up from here, because the MASSIVE buy orders also indicate large interest in the coin.
tl;dr here you witness the early investors who buy LOW.
Buy Low!
I love this concept

Us chancoin holders are going to make it big.
