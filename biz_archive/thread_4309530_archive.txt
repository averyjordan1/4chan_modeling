I wonder what price BCH has to hit before BTC cultists finally admit that this isn't just a pump and dump.
I'm guessing they will be too stubborn to switch because they missed the chance to do it at $500, then at $1000 and now $1500.
Maybe at $3000 they admit defeat.
We shall see.
haha yea ok bud only people who want this are chinks and it's a facade.
knock it off for a bit jfc
There seem to be a bunch of core holdouts who would ride BTC all the way down to $1 because it's "the real bitcoin" lol.The rest of us know that nothing lives forever.
>lets destroy coinbase and bitcoin so no institutional investor will dare put their money in crypto for a long long timeGreat plan my east asian friend
what goes up must come down
If BTC dips below 6k and BCH breaks 2k things are going to accelerate at a rapid pace.
yeah I'm on the BCH train right now.
I really believe in the flippening, or at least the idea that bitcoin cash is the real deal.
>tfw 1500 is now the new floor
Coinbase already announced plans to support BCH starting jan 1st.
A great deal of long term normie investors still have their BCH waiting for them on coinbase from the split.
Only newbies and morons who sold their BCH for more BTC will get fucked.
The rest of us will continue on and those of us who bought BCH early will make huge gains.
Get cucked.
i bet someone said that about bitcoin at 50 $HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH
