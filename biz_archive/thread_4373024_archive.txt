Around 8mhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aeron/
Seems to be a good project and not too much volume for now

If you enter the market now, you will be bagholding...
Hype is done - you are too late if you read this msg.
You think it will stay at that price ?
it could probably go 2-3x more.binance always pumps coins.check the history of coins like Nuls, etc.
all get boosted.
On which time frame you think ?
Volume is relatively low on binance
what hype?
retard.
it just got listed hours ago on binance.
this has got at least 24 hours left to pump
look at the chart idiot you see when the "news" came out and how the chart pumped?
that's it for now.
Stop convincing ppl of buying your shit!
i bought on ed 3 days ago, it's a good fucking project.
why all the negativity?
if you don't want to be a part of stay out of the thread fag.
maybe other people do want to know about it and it hasnt' been talked about at ALL on /biz until tonight.
honestly this guy drives me nuts.... rektaly born people like you are the root problem for other people with good intentions but they are making wrong decisions because of statements like yours.Look - "listed hours ago" what do hours in crypto mean?
1 hour is relative to half a day of 24h in "cryptospace" if you are not there in time, you missed the train.
plain simple.
now he brags about a 3 day advantage and still trys to make ppl think that NOW is the time to enter the market....

Hmm some pretty heavy bags I see...
unironically just bought 1000 ARN.Lets ride this Anon.
I saw a few posts here when it was on ED.
I've been too lazy/paranoid to make an ED account.
Seems like its worth it to get on the ground floor more oftenIs your next focus Publica?
Holding 1300 coins.
Not in a hurry to profit.
ICO buyers were under the water, so they're getting trigger happy to sell slightly higher
Bought 1500 hopefully iâ€™m Not going to hold this bag too long
