Pumping very soon
you doing the pre dump now?
Gonna have to be a hell of a pump to get anywhere, there is a mountain of bags holding this coin down.
Does the average /biz/tard even bother looking up what any of these phrases mean or how a pump & dump works?
pnd groups purposely dump in mass, then start again buy in when it hits a low.
then other people jump in and make the price go higher.this tactic has been used in the stockmarket for years.
and when will dumping very soon?
Nigga, is you retarded?
We back in the $7-$8 swing period like it was before the pump to $10 plus?
I think so.Set your sell/buy orders and get ready for the fun because these waves are the shit.
