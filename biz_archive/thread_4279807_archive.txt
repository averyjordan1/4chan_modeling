Price dipped tonight.....this is only 2.3x from ICO price.
Volume steadily going up...Do you really believe garbage like gnosis, iconomi and dgb deserve higher mcaps?
ok keep buying link
There will be a round 2 tonight and who knows what will happen once it reaches Polo and Bittrex (confirmed polo had some of them on its account).
My bags are full from the ICO.
This hold is comfy af lads.
where did you see it was confirmed polo had some?
Is it even worth it to buy now?
Looks way too high at the moment
The token is useless
