pol got Donald Trump elected through meme magic.
Why is biz so divided?
Why don't we just band together to meme coins into 10000% gains?
We are already meming link, and to a lesser extent BCH, the real bitcoin.
The prisoner's dilemma has people shilling and FUD'ing their different shitcoins instead of collaborating on a single coin.
LINKYes>BCHFuck no
I say we start meming BCH it has potential for gains right now link is a long play and the BCH VS BTC battle will probably destroy crypto meaning it will never moon.
I say we just fucking sink this ship with BCH and bail
/reddit/BCH will replace BTC as the one real bitcoin.
