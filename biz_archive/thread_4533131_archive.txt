Ride the chink pump/dump for BCH, sell at 4k, then ride the SALT launch and sell when it hits $15
It is already at 1700 sub levels, do you think risk reward is there ?
Put it in ETH right now.It's going to 500 by the end of next month.
risen another $30 since you posted thatthey clearly think the potential is there or they wouldn't recommend it
Any alts do you recommend.
Don't listen to anyones advice on alts, check coinmarket cap and investigate all the top 50, then compare the fundamentals with the meme lines.
You can play ADHD games and try to play minute to minute lotteries.
Or you can man up and ask one simple question: "Will BCH become the major chain of Bitcoin and replace BTC?"
If it's yes, then it's a simple buy as you're headed to $8000 and well beyond.
If it's a no, don't buy.
Buy or sell only when information other than price changes your assessment if this.
Buy 5k set of kneepads>wait two weeks for value to appreciate>sell for 10k
This is solid advice but be quick on the trigger if you plan to fuck with BCH
no way its going 4k wtf
All I know is ethereum is up like 20% in the last week.
Give it time.
Can see it hotting .351 by end of day
True, that's not my exit point but im a pussy
isn't SALT like bcc?
sounds like a ponzi?
HST
Possibly doge
