I've seen this pattern before.
BTC has not properly broken through 8k yet, and the investors are diversifying with a false sense of confidence that BTC has stabilised.
As much as I hate this POS coin, something tells me BTC is going to go on a ATH breaking rally before it stabilises into alt season.Be cautious, don't be overconfident biz.
I hope you all make tons of money.
