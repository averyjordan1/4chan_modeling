Fine by me, don't say I didn't warn you boss.
Regardless if it's getting pumped or not, there is news and it is in the early stages, this stock has had previous increases before.
It's simple T&A, it has plenty of potential and I'm glad I'm in.
LOL wtf?
dude no joke, have no idea who this is
4469053are you new to the internet?
every fucking person on /biz/ is in 1293812938 pnd groups.
you dont need to shill it here.
you fucking cuck.
Honestly I wish you guys luck with these literal shit tier 'pump and holds', I hope some of you get a bit of profit, but don't cry when vizard jews you and the coin either doesnt do shit or dumps, like every single time before>n-no we pumped just fine it went up 10 satoshisYeah and then viz and any other bagholders dump immediately telling everybody to hold so nobody else dumpsAgain I still wish you success, but don't cry when you either get burned or your lower-than-pajeet level shilling doesnt work
They are rebranding to fucking BEANCASH...
Seriously... BCASH, BITCOIN CASH, BEAN CASH.
Advertising themselves as bitcoin cash's little brother.
This is a disaster.
Anyone who doesn't want to lose money please do yourself a favour and stay away from this pile of garbage
BEANCASHoh pls be true...
