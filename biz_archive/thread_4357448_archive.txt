REQ
Don't be a fucking pussy faggot.
DO IT.worst case - lose 1000Best case - make shit loads
But REQ will likely use LINK lmao.
LINK speaks for itself if you read the whitepaper.
Doesn't really determine which would be the better investment.
Arguably the token mechanics for REQ are better than Link because no one really knows how impactful the tokens will be for Node running and what the demand would be for the current circulating supply vs what Sergey will provide out of the teams supply.
Any coin that gets shilled hard by biz is shit.
Just buy BTC and chill.
crypto prices are about technical aspects Lol.
Remember ur friend held ETH 4 years faggot
Whatever you do don't be a faggot that sells bc your investment went down some percentage.
This is crypto and if you can't stomach the losses you don't deserve the gains.
Yeah glad I didnâ€™t buy eth when biz shilled it every day for 3 years
why the fuck isnt it on bittrex?
Yeah im so glad I avoided buying ETH and NEO in early 2017.
Man think of how much money I would of lost if I listened to /biz/
