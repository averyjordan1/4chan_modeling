How can we test if an anon is a shill or legit?
Are they giving actually logical reasoning on why you should get into something, or is it all just hot air 'buy or be poor' garbage to try and get people to FOMO buy.
That simpleAlso run people's logic through your own head to see if it actually makes sense
you=shillme=legit
The shills know about as much as the 'legit' guys so always assume shill.
Posting style
Just ask for logical arguments.
If they respond with something like "Huuuuh (put a ridiculous prediction here) by EOY 2017!!!
Don't be stoopid!!!!!!!"
then you know it's a stupid shill.
Make an AI program to analyse people's posts.
Sometimes shills have premade texts and don't answer.
Some users have legit posts with similar texts and they get hated on.
Lose/lose?I'm leaning towards being a grammar nazi.
