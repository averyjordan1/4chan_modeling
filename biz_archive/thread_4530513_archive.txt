I want to know a good time to sell bch?Catching a buzz doesnt help I feel like I'm going to fuck up and become a bagholder.
I bought at .16 clean
Hold everything for 1+ more year.
It will be worth much more.
Kek chill, it's not even at 40% of where it will end ;)
Im seeing around 1850 is resistance should I sell there and but the dip?Serious question is that what you are doing {biz]?
yes retard if u cant buy the dip then u lose a pit of profits but better than getting stuck
only a pothead or neet actually thinks botcoin is worth anything
Sell fucking now you retard don't get greedy.
This can dump 50% in an hour
You're gonna hold mad bags, terrible buy
I sold at .21What do I do now.I made 3200 off this pump I'm just shy of 20k help me out.Eth or btc buy the dip?btc long?
Hold the fiat dumbass until the next bear market
I have .5 btc in eidoo but thats not doing anything.That was an actual full btc at the time I purchased it it ico.
Eidoo is actually quite low from ico maybe I should buy more.
>selling right before operation dragon slayeranon, grats on the gains but you're about to see some serious shit
I would have to tether up to do this.
No.
I'm holding BCH until information changes my opinion that acceptance, adoption and support will continue to grow.
Don't play ADHD games.
Im setting a buy order for bch at .16
All this noob money that flooded in to pump bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
You canâ€™t just magic a market cap like that out of thin air.
Something has to snap.Ethereum is gradually rendering bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies obsolete.
.999999999
Hold until the difficulty adjustment for BTC.
That's the main reason for the pump right now.
If nothing ends up happening with that then BCH is gonna drop like a rock
setting buy orders
ETH as a currencyNope
Degenerate
Go to sleep
