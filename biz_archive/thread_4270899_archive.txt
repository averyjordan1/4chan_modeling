redpill me on REQ /biz/Why I should I put my money in it?
it's a shit, do not put money there.
You will regret
thanks pajeet
should think twice before investing your money in crypto currency.
But there is one project in which you can invest.
this is Diamond (DMD) diamond-info.github.io
thanks pajeet
sort of agressive logo's on the pictures with money skelly.
theres so many posts about req if you still haven't bought in you deserve to stay poor
investing in /biz/ memes
if you were intelligent you would've bought when everyone were making REQT memes and its still going to go up from here on out
please for real stop shilling it.
please.
just stop the fucking threads and stay out of REQ.
buy link or smth like that.
xvg maybe too.
If you wanna stay out from pump and dumps, shitcoins and all that, buy REQ.
Wait a year and enjoy your money.Thats all
Req is the closest thing crypto has to a sure thing.
But for this security you will have to hold longer than the average pajeet attention span.
Depends on your investment strategy.
But REQ will slowly moon til' Q2.
No need to chase 24 / 7 pnd coins.Read the whitepaper.
Read the blogs and i would even dig deep into the burning mechanism.
Pajeets on this boards wont understand it anyway, but it is more valuable than staking.
Vitalik did a good blog article about the tech behind the burning mechanism.
