TFW I found out that a handful of my fucking teachers actually own bitcoin, and not even few.My sports teacher has 3.2 BTCMy history teacher has 5+ BTCThey are all complete idiots and have no idea about anything whatsoever, I am guessing their IQ is maximum 90.
It's going mainstream!Just another sign that the king can never be fucked with.
fucking normiez have more btc than md
its been mainstream since 1k crash when every news outlet reported on bitcoin "death"
Who cares, they prolly bought the shit at 7k and are going to lose it all anyways.
Just load up on ETH.
BTC will go mainstream and then normie money will flood the second coin in hopes of BTC initial gains thus pumping up your ETH.It's right next to BTC on normiebase.
I dont see this happening, I see normies trying their best to cut and run without looking back once btc crashes
