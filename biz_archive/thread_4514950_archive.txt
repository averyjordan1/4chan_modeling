What is nuls guys?
Why did that whale say it was a good 15x?
I can't read chinks language.
Is anyone else buying this?
What made you invest?
gay
I bought a bit over 1000 at $0.30.
I hear it's going to be the next ANS/NEO.
But even if it makes it to $5 I'd be pretty happy.
The marketcap isn't huge either, so it has the potential to go there.
Idk but I'm 60% in on it at this point >What made you invest?The girl on their team was cute
NULS is a chinese Point of Credit Blockchain.
Instead of having one chain employed for multiple different uses like ETH NULS is looking to use consensus protocols to utilize multiple chains for specific functions.
It was overbought due to the Binance competition and will correct for the next week or so.
Under .0001btc is a high price target.
Looking to buy more at .00008
well, someone just bought a few thousand at 0.00008.
You?
Pick up a master node or two if you can.
This’ll be big over the next few months.
I dont remember the prices but I got in just at the big pump then sold near ath luckily.
I'm staying away from NULS for a while, I still have zero idea what it is or what makes the token valueable
NULL NOTHINGNULS EVERYFING
NUL IS LOVE, NUL IS LIFE
Nuls will be the block chain solution of the Orient.
NULL way overpriced for being miles away from doing anything.I will buy a MN at .35.
It’s rape at $.75.
POWR>does nothing M market cap >OMG>does nothingM market capSo why do you think NULS is overpriced at 25M?
How many for a master node?
That's one hell of a shitcoin lol.
