Probably drop down to 6000 again this weekend during Jihan's second attack.
This time there will be less panic selling, people have seen it before, so the price won't drop below 6000 again.And if you don't think there will be a second attack, have you ever studied Asian warfare?

Well, I kinda agree.
But the asians are not by themselves.
They need the whole world and I doubt they will get such a strong momentum again like they did on a second attempt, due to the lack of panic sale you mentioned.
