Can someone explain to me how the "12 word phrase" works at a technical level?
For example, if my computer messed up and I wanted to get my cryptocurrency back, how does the 12 word key relate to a private key?
The 12 word key is work as a private key for your own private key...
Oh I see, so it's basically a "key for your key", so even if you lose your computer data - as long as you have your 12 words you can re-create your private key and thus have access to your crypto?
you can use your 12 word seed to recover your wallet even without knowing the password.
Think of it as something that generates addresses directly.
That's why you need to be super careful while dealing with it, if anybody else has access to it, all your LINK can be gone in a matter of seconds.
Yes, an algorithm takes the 12 word phrase and decrypts, recreating your private key.
