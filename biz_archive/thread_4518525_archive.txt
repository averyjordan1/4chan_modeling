I'll put my 2 cents in... Looks like it's pooled hashing on the same machines.
Host can buy a few good machines and just guarantee the minimum hash rate and that would only go down if the host loses a customer.
The cost they're selling at looks like you could just be investing in the cost of the hardware therefore after all the hardware is paid there's no need for customers and that's the out.
IMO pass and just buy an actual miner for that price.
If you don't live in a country with cheap electricity there's no way for you to compete with Chinese mining cartels buying your own miner.
Fair point electricity costs aside there's no real guarantee this site will be live upon ROI.
