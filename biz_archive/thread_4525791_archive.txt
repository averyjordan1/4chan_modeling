Stupid bullshit like tangle, what's wrong with a blockchain
I had looked into it a few months ago, has to search a while to find all the githubs and (self-written) Wikipedia pages about it, and a few collegues and I judged it to be not relevant and not sure to be functioninghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Hashgraph,As a side node, a graph of hashes exists for decades and goes by Merkle tree.
A git repo is also organized like a blockchain.
Proof of work and to some extent Smart contracts are from the 90's too, btw.
