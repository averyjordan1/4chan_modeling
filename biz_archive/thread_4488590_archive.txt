Should I throw my shickles at QSP?
I want unbaised opinions please, I just want to make money, do you see this going anywhere?From what I have gathered their ICO discounts was insainly large for the people who got into Tier 1 presales, 1 ETH = 10000 QSP while the tier 4 and crowdsale costed 1 ETH = 5000 QSP, this to me was really ridiculous.
The projects fundimentals wasen't good as well as its for secuirty audits for smart contracts which no project will likely use as they are their own testers.
Their team seems not good, below average and their website is not appealling.
Their name is okay and logo looks good.
Their comminity manager is an Smug Indian.
The Token allocation is pretty bad with only 65% in the token sale and the rest to the company.
I see this ICO failing firsthand with a 33 million starting marketcap just for Auditing smart contracts.If you guys have any thoughts on this can you tell me?
their team seems pretty good, same university as money skeleton except they are phds.seems like a lot of demand cause they closed ICO early and price is 35% above ICO already.
This might be a moon mission...
Anyone who got into the tier 1 discount had to split their investment into the other tiers to get the tier 1 discount.
No1 got full tier 1 discountProject is good, will be useful when/if smart contracting becomes more mainstream.
Remember pajeet kid locking a few millions$$ in ether a month ago?
cant happen with this techAlso, team is ok, and public interest is high, as guy above me said, 35% above ICO and we barely started yet.
I was on Reddit and everyone was bitching because the CEO is a hard core memer and is focusing on memes and shit instead of a working product.
They literally hate it.It's /our coin/.
I bought in at 1.1k satoshi.
