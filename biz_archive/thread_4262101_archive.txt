a half hour before you made this post I converted all of my bitcoin into ethereum for safe keeping.
My theory is that bitcoins price is artifically high due to anticipation of the fork which didnt end up happening.
And that this in turn has been keeping the price of ether down.
Im the proud new owner of 40eth.
Volume is picking up, this might be the breakout u are waiting for.
