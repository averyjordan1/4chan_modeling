btc goes down alts go down now because no fork?
>shitty BTC fork everyone buried in August moonscan't win
These forks have raped the alt market.
Fucking BTC insiders are killing real innovation
Oh wait wtf I just noticed, the money is flowing back into bitcoin cash from other alts and bitcoin
I fucking hate this meme market, you'd expect money to finally flow back into good alts, no, instead we get another dump to buy that shitty bitcoin chink imitiation.
stay calm my friendsany coin on bittrex is a pump and dumpBCH will face the same outcome.people got a little FOMO'y, took out their BTC money and put into BCH.BTC going back to 7k, BCH will dump, then BTC steam will run out, back to 6.2k, alts pump
