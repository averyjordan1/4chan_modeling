>yfw he hasn't dumped his BCash yetHow high will it let it go?
I've had this trigger over the sell button for like an hour now lol, can't believe this runI'm just waiting for the lag to start and then its time
There is no flippening just a chinkening
I have been too lazy to move my BTC into another wallet to access my Bcash, by the time I get it sorted the Bcash pump will be over, better luck next pump I will pass on this one.
