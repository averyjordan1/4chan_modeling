dumb newfag
hey at least you could withdraw from kraken, ive been getting "this feature has been disabled" for about a week now
Why Kraken orders are failing at a 7/10 ratio with 30 sec timeout between them?
How comes this crap gets away with it
you need to refresh the new order page just before sending the order.
