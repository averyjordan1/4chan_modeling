correct me if im wrong, but as opposed to the stock market, futures trading, etc.. there is no military industrial complex investment when it comes to crypto.
RFID tech with walton is the closest i can think of.
I frankly find that aspect incredibly comforting.
Solar coins seem to get some pretty large and consistent support.
THE DARK SIDE; what do you think the military industrial complex involved, or roughly equivalent will be in crypto?
Factom looks to be the government insider and military industrial complex coin
wow, i legit bought half of one a while back, then sold it.
from their logo and all around aura, i honestly thought they were harmless and never looked into what they did.
you just blew my mind a little bit anon
They've got grants from border security and other governmental agencies.
I have not followed the project for a while but they do have a powerful product.
Is factom about to moon?
DESU, i have watched its charts here and there since i sold at .016i can say it looks like its inevitable.before this year or beggining of next??
time will tellPersonally, my theory is that the whales are PND'ing shit coins to eventually buy the good ones low because they were overlooked because of their PnD's.
fatcom is on my radar as one of the meta game coins for these behemoths.
ZCash, obviously.
