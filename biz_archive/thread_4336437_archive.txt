ooh.
oo-okay
Came to /biz/ for advice on cryptos in March when I was just familiarizing myself with things, and some guy conviced me to daytrade because "you can only make so much with hodling", so I daytraded Ark, PIVX, ETH and Ripple, making a total of 6% in BTC value before falling for a PnD and losing half of my stack.
Could have made made over 10k just by holding those coins even though my investment was pretty modest.>JUSTI know you're out of ETH, I just wanted to share because I got JUSTed pretty badly
same.
i could of made 60k but i leaped at a 3k gain and pissed away lots of coins in quick trades.
i only invested $300 to begin with.im just going to build a small portfolio this time and leave for a few years and consider the money burned.
hopefully be pleasantly surprised.I mean fuck man I had some MONA from 2014 i mined sitting on some old usb drive, then suddenly wow i can get $ out of this?
fuuck.good things come to those who wait.though im so broke now its hard to get back into this shit.
I actually came out green but I was in very serious need of money so I cashed out all my crypto in august.
I originally put in less than $500 and was able to cash out 900$ so at least it was worth it, but I think about what could have been every single night.
I was able to put in $200 since then, and now I'm just looking for good alts to hold for long term.
I also mined an ETH fork called Ellaism for about a month before the difficulty went up, got about 700 coins, and sold them at 2500 sat a piece a month later when it showed up on some pajeet exchange.
ok fuk itgimme ur eth wallet boyo
i had like 200 ETH.
mostly mined back when you could GPU mine solo.All of it sold for a measly $3000.
lol fucki mean i didn't lose anything i made money.but in retrospect i could held on to that for a few years and had 60k instead.
x288CEd11Ffbbe2933791c34B4e4edE2A2FDE0cbEThanks anon.
My stack isn't even tadpole level now so I appreciate whatever you can spare Damn, can't say I know that specific feel but missed opportunities and "if only I held" has pretty much been my year so far even though I made a bit of money from crypto.
sent anongo and make 7 million out of these blessed 7$
I bought into ANT...I've done nothing but lose in this coin and watched everything I have go away.
Now I don't touch anything besides the big three because of this stupid investment.
Best part is after I sold at a major loss, there was a significant bump (albeit wouldn't even break me even if I sold at the peak).
God is laughing at me
yeah man.
this next year i'm eating less and cheaper.
not buying bullshit thats not needed.
and everything i save is pumping into crypto for the long painful hold.i would of suffered anyway so might as well suffer a bit harder for the hopes of a huge return.
Bought SIA, REDD and DGB at ATH.

Broke for 1500 bucks with Pot Limit Omaha Poker0xa94501263cec35ce351fb81af0661f828abf39e6
Thank you so much anon, I'll try to make the best of iti would of suffered anyway so might as well suffer a bit harder for the hopes of a huge return.Amen.
I feel like the only way I'll ever "make it" is if I can get good gains from crypto, otherwise I'll just be a depressed wagecuck for the next 35 years, so might as well be a slightly more uncomfortable but way more hopeful wagecuck for a while

None of you can compete with my story: in 2011 I wanted to sell my World of Warcraft character which had everything you could ever imagine to the max, all of it.
Someone offered me 200 BTC, but I refused him, demanding either 100 USD or my local currency equivalent.
Even though I had heard of BTC before, I've never looked into it, thinking that it's just a meme.
In fact, if I remember correctly, I didn't even check the price.
But I did check it, out of curiosity this midsummer.
And you know how much it was?
Between February and April, it was ~1 USD.
One.
O-N-E, mother fucker.
Now multiply that with 7,000 and see for yourself why I'm considering suicide.
The worst part of it?
I was playing on a private server because I couldn't afford it on retail; I gave up playing shortly after, never sold it, the server is gone.0x50Aaa2c85dFAa365004F96A83Ed0236EcE841F60
