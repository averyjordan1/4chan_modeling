This is probably a stupid question, but does my signature need to be my full name?Lets pretend my name is John Jordan Smith, Jordan being my middle nameI've signed most documents and contracts using just my surname and middle name most of my lifeBut last time when renewing my passport the lady there was giving me a pretty hard time saying that I needed to sign my full nameIs this true?
have I been fucking over myself for half of my life?
have I been fucking over myself for half of my life?yes retard youre fucked
:(so I guess I just start signing my full name then
No.
You can sign a happy face for all you care I think there are just specific regulations and rules that apply to certain things like state issued id
i was just kidding dude god fucking damn.
dont give me that sad face.
im literally shaking
Most people just scribble a bunch of loops and lines dude.
Don't be so fucking autistic about such a trivial thing.
You're signing for your strawman anyways.
jor is dat u?
thanks guys, I was getting paranoid, guess I'll just keep an extra eye for those pesky requirements then
signature is just supposed to be something that is 'your mark' in terms of lawthat is, something that generally looks the same and can be attributed to yousome govt shit require a legible signature but thats just them being bitchesgenerally you can get away from doing the same scribble each time
