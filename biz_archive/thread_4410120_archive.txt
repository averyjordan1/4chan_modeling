Hello,I am just so freaking confused.
I started getting into crypto a short while ago and have gotten myself a ledger and bought my first parts of a Bitcoin.
Been holding for a month or two.
I have no decided to try and get into alt coins, but where should I store it?
I realise I Ledger doesnt support all altcoins.Whats a good wallet and what is important to remember not to jeopardize my money.Also, moving my BTC to different exchanges to get into different alt coins and then possible move back some BTC to my ledger etc.
etc.
seems like a pretty costly way of doing business... Am I missing something?Would be so grateful for answers, thanks!
do you even use 4chan
Nice meme m8
Get a usb drive.put your wallet on it.It's not going to get corrupted, OP.
It only happens to really unlucky people.
