Droppin in for a legit shill on this stuff.
I think this coin has great potential.
It's DPoS and follows in the model of ARK and LSK.The key thing to mention is that it is relatively new, and has had one major pump/dump.
It seems to be leveling out after six months of downtrending... almost where it was pre-pump.What gets me, is this bad boy has an EXTREMELY LOW circulating supply of 11mil.
Compare that to ARK/LSK which are around 100mil.
Now look at the price difference... here you have a coin that has been hovering around the $1 mark for months.
I think it is supremely undervalued.Thoughts?
the devs are shady as fuck
Care to explain?
I'm not 100% on board yet, I just look for good opportunities
there was some internal drama and they postponed their product release to 2018 or sth, so you will have to hold till then.
this is 100% a pnd coinevery few weeks i see a shitload of SHIFT threads flood /biz/ for 8 hours
can you substantiate this?
I'm reluctant to just take anyones word for it with all the fuding and shilling goings on
Yeah, but most people said that about ARK too, when in actuality I was posting a lot of the "shill" threads for it (back when it was 11cents/coin)
There is most definitely some bot activity on this one... this reminds me of a very early ARK.on the downside>"devs are shady and its a pnd"which is basically everyones argument against any coin they don't like, right?
I've been watching this one and I think I'm gonna pull the trigger... its too great of an opportunity to miss out on and my fomo may be getting the better of me, but fuck man, this could be legit.
