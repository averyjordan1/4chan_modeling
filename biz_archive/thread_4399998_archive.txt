No, he does pnd for himself and get's paid by his slaves when he orders them.
Additionally, the articles often leak earlier than when the subscribers get their hands on.
He says he doesn't buy the coins he recommends to avoid conflict of interest.
But I'm sure he just 'loans' his buddies a few hundred thou to dump into his coin before the pump.I don't even care, good for him.
I'm subscribed and so long as he can deliver a solid 1.5x for me once a month, he could make child torture porn in his spare time and I'd turn a blind eye to it.
He delivers the gains and that's all I give a shit about.

He "leaks" em himself.
