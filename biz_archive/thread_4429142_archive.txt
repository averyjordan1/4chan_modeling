Can somebody confort me?
I bought bcpt before the binance competition at 0.36 and then it got dumped to 0.20.. i lost 50% of my portfolio because i thought a buy competition will boost the price.
Do i just kms?
ty for your money man, without that the price wouldn't have gone as high at is should be.
Need more people like you in crypto to keep doing this until I make at least a million then I'm out
I hope you get cancer and die slowly.
I guess thats how most people will feel about me since I'm getting gains of their losses.
But remember, you made those trades so suck it up and get better or I'll just keep taking your money.
I will accept my loss, waiting for the end of the competition so maybe the winner pumps the price as he wants the most profits.
Then iâ€™m trading eos, iota only.
