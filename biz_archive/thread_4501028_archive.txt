We should ALL be invested in POWR.
In the future you will be able to transfer powr tokens and power your house, car with powr.
The future power grids will be built AROUND this technology, not the other way around.
We are looking at something bigger than Ether.
You will essentially be able to power a car with powr tokens once the world catches up.
This is the /biz/ coin.
The philosopher's stone.
Don't miss this one, Anon
If I go all in on POWR now will Jemma send me pics of her huge milkers?Will only buy if I get Jemma tit pics.
Is it even worth buying in now though?
