$300 bankroll>bankrolllmao>a.
underground poker, have a night out.
I win 50% of the timeIf you're gambling to have fun then ok whatever do that.
Gambling to make money however, is fucking stupid and a sure sign of someone who will remain poor.
And winning 50% of the time isn't actually that good.
The average player odds at major casinos is higher than that, not something to brag about.>bitcoin miningBuying a GPU is a good idea, but mining bitcoin on a $300 is a waste of time.
Mine an altcoin that can actually make you non-trivial amountshttps://whattomine.com/

You are so wrong on basically all levels one he said poker not gambling and if you don’t know the difference you’re definitely retarded.And two there is no casino in the world that gives the player 50% or better odds i think you’re the dumbest person on biz congrats
I actually made 4k from $500 on a certain site, stashed away now though since the price is falling.
There is money to be had in mining.
