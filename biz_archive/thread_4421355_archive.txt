What price does /biz/ see this coin going to?
$2
Probably 1$ 3-6 months.
As an Australian I do not believe this coin will go anywhere soon (unless on hype).
Australia is too backwards.
It will go to a dollar within a couple of weeks.Tesla announcement would have it reach $7-10>government backed>https://medium.com/power-ledger/australian-government-awards-grant-to-8-million-project-in-the-city-of-fremantle-using-the-power-2dbadfad50ae

eternal slow bleed like every other shitcoin
5000ish sats but still 4x the current value thanks to more BTC mooning next year
Based on what?
Shitter coins have made it far further based on far less.
$2 by EOY 2018 is extremely conservative
