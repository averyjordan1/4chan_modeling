Taking a break from crypto for a minute to discuss something a little different and more business relatedWould it be worth it to open a local Japanese import shop?
And sell things like anime/body pillows/onaholes/figures/dvds/blurays/manga/magazines/japanese treats, etc.
?Could this be profitable or is it more trouble than it's worth?
Going to the mall is always boring to me because the most "obscure" thing you'll find is a Star Wars or Game of Thrones t-shirt.
But I would enjoy going a lot more if they sold things I liked.
How big would you say the market for this is in a medium to large sized western city?
I live in the United States, by the way.
