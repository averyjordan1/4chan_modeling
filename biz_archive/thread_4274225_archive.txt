What's stopping me from placing high sell orders on etherdelta and then just buying them to inflate the price of a shitcoin?
Nothing but the transaction fees.
Can small fish like myself do this profitably or is this a Whales game only?

the last trade price has no impact on the next trade price.
it's baffling how ED confuses you goofballs.
you probably think you have to buy an entire order too.
