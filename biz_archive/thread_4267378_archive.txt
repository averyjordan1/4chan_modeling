I will quietly leave this here, while linkies and all you null marines look past this and I accumulate to run muh nodes.Crown has released Systemnodes.
In this release, Systemnodes act as incentivized full-nodes much like traditional Masternodes.
These nodes require only 500 CRW as opposed to Masternodesâ€™ 10,000 CRW collateral.
Systemnodes will receive 10% of the block reward which is a proportionately higher payout percentage than Masternodes.
This has been put in place to incentivize the creation of as many Systemnodes as possible.
The goal of the Crown project is to provide a decentralized platform that enables individuals to build a future as they envision it by making use our platform to build cloud business applications.Systemnodes provide a way for smaller holders to get involved by providing network infrastructure and the resources for a future layer of utility services for the network, beginning with time keeping servers but is expandable from there.
Systemnodes are the first piece in a series of updates that will allow this vision to become a reality.
Systemnodes are a key element in the network features that will drive Crown Atomic (read more: https://crown.tech/atomic).
