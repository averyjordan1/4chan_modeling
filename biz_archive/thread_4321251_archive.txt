just bought enough btc so that when it hits 10k, eventually, I will only then make profit on my initial investment.
crypto is just not for me, im not gonna make it
Just stay out of altcoins (until Hashgraph goes public)
yeah altcoins were one mistake.
another was actually believing the flippening.
lost 2k because of those fucking gooks
Me too OPMight put a bit in alts but I'll pribably just hold.
My initial investment wasn't high to have taken huge losses last night.Glad I'm not the only one
Why would you stay out of altcoins?
Only to make real money.
Wtf do i want with 20% btc gains?
You're going to make it as long as you remember you only invest what you are comfy leaving out on your front lawn over night.
