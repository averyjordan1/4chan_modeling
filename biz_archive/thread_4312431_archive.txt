ETH Classic riding on that BCH wave.
ETC should be more valuable than ETH because immutable blockchain.
I’ve been says ETC for a month.
It only goes up as long as you hold it.
I made 40%+ in last 2 days alone.
It’s literally BCH2.0 in the making to ETH
what's the difference between eth and etc
What will happen after ETH forks again due to Parity fuck up?Will we get ETH, ETC and ETCH ??
XD
But the price is way too high to buy now.
ETC is the real Ethereum.ETH is a fork of Ethereum that was created after a hacker exploited buggy code written on Ethereum and stole DAO funds.The literally turned back time to make the hack undone.
The went to a block before the hack, fixed the bugs and forked from there.
ETC going to $40 by this time tomorrow.
Will overtake LTC in 2/3 weeks
It's Ethereum's Bitcoin Cash.
