This is serious thread.Read other threads where people laugh at Confido holders for losing everything.Now, THINK.If you check developers comments history, yesterday he was discussing partnership.Today, he suddenly announced that they have legal issues.
ON A FUCKEN SUNDAY HE ANNOUNCES THEY HAVE LEGAL ISSUES.Now THINK SMART ANON --> no reason for devs to run out with their money right now.
Trend was bullish, people were buying all over, new exchange was listed just recently, they could have waited a week and cashed out 2x unless.....
UNLESS TODAY IS GOING TO BE BLACK BLOODY MONDAY OF BITCOIN TOTAL COLLAPSE.These guys have some insider info and they have cashed out everything they have had.NEO devs FOMOed AS HARD AS THEY NEVER DID to cash out as much money as possible.
They have even spread fake screenshots of a WHOLE WEEK of great announcments.We saw LAST 35 MILLION of TETHERS issued for BITCOIN to be pushed above 8k to force uptrend.ANON, THIS IS SHADY AS FUCK.Tomorrow BItcoin is probably going to collapse.It is up to you to decide what to do.
I don't insist that you should fixate a loss but if you can to sell now and buy on Tuesday.
DO IT.Something is going to happen tomorrow.
This is not a coincidence.
This is not a joke.
There already tons of threads of upcoming Bitcoin crashed due to GOX 2.0 but this CONFIDO team run away at last moment RAISES SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS.
Never pass up any opportunity to push whatever you're pushing, I say.
thanks about to sell all my crypto.
wil buy back in after crash
Delusional you been blazin too much bro
Yeah, it's weird.But if it was true then instead of only two teams doing unusual things these days we would've seen hundreds of teams doing similar weird things.
Unless.......unless whole altcoin market is tanking for 1.5 month not only in Satoshi but in USD 2-3x less for most of the coins.
Considering that most of the hodlers & whales do not sell at such a huge loss... Who is selling?
Hmmmm....
Yeah, confido crashed because the devs are Bitcoin insiders, not that they are possibly going through an exit scam.
>When you hear hoofbeats...
CATASTROPHYIf you're going to use fancy words like CATASTROPHE, at least take the 5 seconds required to spell check it.
Even my browser is telling me that the word above is wrong.
Carry on.
yeah this 7 digit exit scam completely verifies it for me.
this is the trigger right here.
short btc 100x leverage no stops
Phew, that's rough.
I am sure glad I have my money in something safe like LINK.
I suggest you all buy link and bunker down to ride out this storm where it is safe.
The Lord Sergey, KEKs disciple, will protect us.

>Be confido Devsm marketcap>Sell confido>Tweet "legal problems">Confido tanks to sub-1m marketcap>Buy Confido with 10x purchasing power days later tweet "it's fine its over we fixed the legal problems">Confido shoots up and then it hits exchanges and shoots up even more because the circulating amount of Confido is around 10% of the original amount after the devs bought almost all of it.
Tfw confido is now 800m marketcap and it was one of the biggest heists of all time, triggered by a single tweet.

Link has become such a /biz/ meme.
But I really don't see it going much lower.
2000 sats seems to be where it likes to sit other than a couple spikes downward.
Probably is a good idea to hang out with the deluded linkies for a bit.
r-r-rolling!
