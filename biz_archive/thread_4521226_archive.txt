how much do i need to retire, considering inflation?
2 million USD?
There is no retiring from crypto, ever.
You are never going to get amazing returns with the money you take out, so you just keep rolling from one moon mission to another.
Forever.
Nonstop.
Depends on the life that you want.
At this point I’d be able to live the life that I want for 1.3 million but I don’t have lofty ambitions.
I want an old Victorian home in Astoria OR with a wife and some dogs.
300k for the house, 1 million invested to live off of.
Maybe I’d need a little more depending on how aggressively I’m investing.
Obviously more is better but 1.3 is enough for me to not have to worry about wage cucking anymore.
