big dick coins only
I sense a dump coming :*(
why a dump?
Monero will probably be ok. Last night as everything went to shit during the panic Monero randomly mooned.
It seems like a fairly safe harbor right now.
it will dip below 130$, r-right guise?
i could've bought this chadcoin for 130$ yesterday but i though it will dip today.
TF you mean.
I put my money in monero last night and when i woke up i was 5% poorer
Below 130 yes it easily could.
But I don't think we will ever see sub 100 again.
near term, it's going to be stable and slightly up.
i'd accumulate anywhere under 142, long term anywhere under 170
