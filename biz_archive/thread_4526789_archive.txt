How do you enter all those trades into blockfolio?
is there an api or a simpler way than typing numbers like 0.0111289351 a hundred times?
No.
It's why I stopped bothering with it.
This, if you're highly active don't waste your time.
already uninstalled that bs.
It should synchronize with your exchange acc or something.
I just use it as an easy phone app for monitoring prices quickly, and some alarms.
Still need an actual computer to do anything more than that.
That's a shame.
I was an easy way to track profits How else can I track my profits?
Binance only shows total account.
How can I see individual coins?
You usually don't wanna know overall profits but single trade profits.
So i delete old trades and input new ones.Only bigger or risky ones though, so i can watch profit and don't have to use calculator all the time.
Oh jeez, doing this will be a nightmare for my taxes.
Do you register your profits in USD or BTC?
I have no idea what the best approach is here.
honestly, i prefer USD, because remembering differences in 8+ digit numbers is not for me.
Manually, but I don't do it after every trade.
I update the values of my coins about every month.
Wish I knew there was a way to delete all the transactions fast, so I don't use calculus inside my head and just type out values from my accounts.
