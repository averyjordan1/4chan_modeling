Anyone got news from this shitcoin?
Blog seems dead and i got kicked from their SS telegram chat.
Bags are havy right now.
Glad I dropped my bags in time for yesterdays alt rush.
Same goes for LAToken.
Any infos?
Threw 1 ether at their ICO.
So far ~60% down.
Gonna keep holding and see what happens, at this point I consider it lost money and won't bother selling at a loss.
