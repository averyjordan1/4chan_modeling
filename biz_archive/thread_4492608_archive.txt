So how much longer are we going to keep ignoring the 800 pound Gorilla in the room?
Bitcoin's high transfer fees, long wait times and fundamental difficulties in its infrastructure from the increased complexity in mining are all pointing to one thing and that is a great exodus from Bitcoin to "the new Bitcoin"If we think in terms of market cap, the obvious competitor to Bitcoin would be Ethereum however its creator is unfortunately an autistic manchild that has posted questionable comments regarding children that may come back and haunt him.The runner up is ironically Bitcoin Cash after a Fork was implemented in an attempt to solve and rectify Bitcoin's problem with mining difficulties and congestion in the blockchain; moreover BCH seems to be pandering to those who wish to mine and become part of an infrastructure in a blockchain with attractive hashrates and rewards to those who give computing power.Last but not least are the altcoins such as Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Zcash, Ripple and other coins that have proven to have a team of active developers and a community in favor of the growth and expansion of their currency.Bitcoin has had its moment in the sun, and it is dangerously blowing out of proportions in terms of price.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall and it may reach over 10k before it finally blows up in a glorious event of pink.Don't say you weren't warned.
I'm making 6x mining BTG with 1 gpu compared to bitcoin.
BTG will replace bitcoin.
