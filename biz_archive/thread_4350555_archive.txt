I've done some research on a newly released coin that's gone under the radar for a while.
Do your own research, but I think it's a safe way to make 2-3x gains.Unikoin Gold is a esports betting coin that already has a working product (www.unikrn.com).
It got venture capitalist funding, including Mark Cuban, as far back as 2014, which shows how legit these guys are.
(It's estimated to be 25x harder to achieve traditional VC funding then ICO funding).The token sale was undersold.
They raised $30m, half of which was institutional investors.
This led to them releasing 125m tokens, at an average cost of $0.32 per token.
The downside here is that there are a lot of tokens sitting in reserve, but much of it will be sent to cold storage or for betting reserves.Now here's how you can make money: the coin is sitting at $0.20 right now, making the circulating market cap around $25m, which is extremely tiny for such a high profile project.They're releasing on a major exchange within the next 2 days (they said "10 days" from Nov. 5), and with their connections I wouldn't be surprised if it's bittrex caliber.
Binance at the very least.
Also they have major announcements this week, which should bring the hype back.
It's sitting at all-time low, and I doubt it goes any lower, so there's very little risk.https://twitter.com/UnikrnCo/status/929081977470443522
