I lost 2 BTC on bitmex because some motherfuckers decided to pump the price from 7500$ to 8000$ in less than 10 min.
Honestly, fuck these dudes.
So much work taking small profit after small profit for it to go up in flames in a matter of minutes.
That was about 30% of my portfolio.
I'll survive but a lesson was learned.
