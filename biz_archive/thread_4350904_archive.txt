How does one prevent their company from being acquired by another?I attempted to do some searching and only came up with people looking for how to get big corporate senpais to notice them, but nothing on how to maintain control if you want to be a focused, independent player to put specific products to market/meet a specific range of demands of consumers or industries.Are all startups just gimicky schemes to get investorbux nowadays?
Needs to be a private company.
More than 50% equity and you remain in control, any less than that and people can uplndermine your board and exacutive selections with proxy votes
