600 euros == 550 btceuro stronk
In English Grammar, we do not refer to each individual dollar as 'them', we use the plural 'dollars'.
Please apply this template to 'euros'.

bought bitcoins for 600 euros>>only 550 of them showed up on my accountIts the same as with computers or phones.When you buy a PC with a 500 GB harddrive, its always something like 460 when it gets to you.Its because the manufacturer count them as 1000 bytes = 1 kilobyte, but your PC uses the 1024 bytes = 1 kilobyte notation.Same with bitcoins.You'll get advertised 1000 sat = 1 BTC, but when you get them, you'll realize 1024 sat = 1 BTC.Something to do with how computers work.Just get used to it.

We are witnessing a new meme in the making right here lads
Funniest post of the day XD
4339788I'm no programmer, but it boils down to something like 8 bits = 1 byte, due to some maths or something, instead of 10 bits = 1 byte, as it "should" be.So due to this a kilobyte (kilo = greek for thousand) is not 1000 bytes, but 1024, but (((they))) conviniently use whatever representation makes for higher numbers if you introduce easer units (e.g.
1 GB = 1000 MB = 1000 * 1000 KB = 1000 * 1000 * 1000 * 8 bit = 8e9 bit, or 1e10 bit, when using 1024)So you see the 1000 notation, because its easier to use and more convinient, but (((they))) use the 1024 notation to sell it too you, because it make sfor higher numbers, and higher = more better.And for bitcoin:600€ = 0.1024 BTC = 0.1000 BTC = 550 €You just fell for the marketing trick.
Forgot to add:Since bitcoins are mined on computers, computer counting applies to them, whereas € or other fiat currency is just printed, so they can only use the kilo = 1000 notation, whereas cryptocurrencies have to have their kilo = 1024 notation due to being from computers, so ((they))) can use the same tricks as with harddrives and iphones.

Can't believe it is 2017 and some people still don't understand the difference between kilo-satoshi and kibi-satoshi.
No wonder it is so easy to make money in this market.
