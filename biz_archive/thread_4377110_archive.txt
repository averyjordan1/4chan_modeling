Do you NOT want a piece of LAND in the future metaverse of humanity?
Do you want to stay stuck in your decaying meatbody like a normie?
Join the future today, as RIGHT NOW a 100 m2 plot of land will cost you 10$... that's 10 cents per 1m2.
Do I have to remind you that the island of Manhattan was bought for a meager 60 guildens in 1626, that's 24$ back then, ~1k$ adjusted to inflation in 2011?
Do I have to remind you of people becoming real life millionaires by trading goods and services in Second Life DESPITE it being a centralized MMO instead of an immersive decentralized VR environment?
Jesus Christ!
I know they are shit at advertising but COME ON PEOPLE!
You are smarter than that, no?!
The open sale of LAND will take place some time at the end of December and you can be sure as shit that the price of MANA won't be anything close to where it sits now (~160-250 SAT).
To clarify, 1k MANA will buy you 1 LAND, which is equivelent to a 100 m2 piece of land in the limited landscape that is Decentaland.

Oh, and to add to the Manhattan comparison, 1m2 of property currently goes for ~10k$
Digital land??

Wow!
How well informed you seem to be good sir!https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/there-never-was-real-tulip-fever-180964915/FYI, this digital land is as limited as BTC just for the sake of scarcity.https://wiki.decentraland.org/index.php?title=Buying_Land#How_Much_Land_Will_There_Be_in_Decentraland.3F"If all initial Mana was converted at 1000 Mana per Parcel to DCL Land and it was arranged in a big square, it would be about 16 km or 10 mi on a side.Hence the land area in Decentraland will be something less than:the size of the original square of land allocated for Washington DC (10mi on a side)twice the land area of San Francisco1/3 the size of Singapore (719.9 km2)17% of the size of the land area of Hong Kong (1,649 km2)7% of the land area of the Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (3,830 km2).In other words, land in Decentraland is scarce, limited, and valuable."
And WTF are you doing here anyway if you have the audacity to compare flower bulbs to the future tech of decentralized P2P crytographic solutions?
Veg much?
FFS Do I have to spell it out to you dweebs in a language you understand?!
