So I see a corrilation with coins mentioned on here that just go down in price when people talk about accumilating it, e.g.
link req.
But are very good with swing trading which I've been doing on them, they seem very easy to swing trade on.
I ain't looking to accumilate them though.
They made my consatantly nice gains
How many % on average do you gain anon?
Do you have any tips.
around 10% gains, for req I just buy around 740 sats and sell around 860.
Its easy because when it comes low I can buy and it instantly goes up fast, probably because people want to accumilate it, makes things easier for me
I've actually have more coins I do this on but link and request are the easiest because hurr durr "deluded" people keep buy them up when its low making things very consistant for me.
I always smile when I see people talking about accumilating them.
What percent of your stack do you use anon?
Do you use you're whole stack?
Also which is easier?
LINK or REQ?
about 10% of my whole profotilo, suprisingly when you put large sell orders someone just buys it up in on go sooner or later.
Request is easier for bigger gains.
And you gain 10% of your trading stack per day?
holy shit
Look athe request chart its flutucations are insane lol
How about the volume?
is it good?
I'm only going to start now so i cant tell if the volume is good or something or if it matters at all.
Volume is around 80 btc usually, I don't really look at it but its fine if you're using something like $2000 to swing it.
Just for request its a little risky because it still has the potential to tank all the way down to 400 sats, so while I'm just making the best of this opportunity right now
