How rich will I get in two months?
Not very rich
Losing everythinf PnD shit
You'll half your initial investment, then you'll attempt to win it back by margin trading and after that you'd end up with a net worth of $2.50
4292189You're kidding, right?
he fell for the PnD of the month
4292272Buying something after it rose 80% within 1-2 days is rarely a good idea.Just remember that everything written here is either shitposting or shilling from people who already invested and want you to push up the price.
The shills turn into fudders the second they sell.If you get in early enough you can make a decent profit, you may even make profit now but the risk / reward ratio is rather bad right now.The same BTC / BCC "flippening" shilling already happened in August and vanished just as fast as it came.
best post I have read all day.
