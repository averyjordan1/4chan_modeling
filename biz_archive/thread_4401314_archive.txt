In just under 2 hours this competition is beginning:https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002790072-BCPT-Trading-Competitionwhat's the plan to stock up?
May the best bot win.
this shit will go parabolic
you think they will be fighting over supply or is there another outcome im not seeing
BUY NOW people, it’s at 0.30 atm and will go to a new ath 0.50 in the following days.The competition clearly states you must buy and not sell the coins and the winner surely wants it to be high value before he jumps ship.
looking at the ENJ and NULS competitions it usually rose the price by 50-100% for a few days
The NULS trading competition ruined the coin for now.
Don't expect anything except narrow trading margins for the entire competition.
nuls is for volume, this for total net purchase
No, after the first few hours, NULS tanked and has been stuck there.
Thanks for this information.
I ended up selling my NULS because of the competition.
Hopefully they won't have one for ARN.
it has a much smaller market cap, do you think that would have any effect on the price?
I don't know, honestly.
I will probably get one of the prizes for NULS just for selling my holdings.
Ha!
pissed me off, so I am bitter about trading competitions.I know that the purpose is to reflect a larger trading volume, but it ruins the natural progression of the coin/token and then it has to recover.
It’s going up boys.
Buy up before 0.35 At midnight the pumping begins.
I figure people might even buy a bit early on spare accounts so they can eat up supply because you win by having the most net purchases so selling doesn't provide any incentive
things are starting to heat up with less than an hour less
Ye but there are big sell walls.
Tho i expect it to grow over the days.It got dumped today already so thats good.
i guess we will see in 30 mins if the whales come out or not
