I fucked up and bought BTG.
Wait, or sell and take the loss?
Bought at 0.037
>buying free money
You were supposed to sell dummy
SHUT UUUUPPP & HEEEELPPPP MEEEE
Did you research this at all?
You know the dev behind this premined tens of thousands of coins and also changed the fee code to send himself money everytime a transaction fee happens.
Good buy there buddy.
Enjoy those bags.
HELP!!!!
No, I saw -100% and thought 'oh boi I can swing this' when it goes back upbut am dumb cuz it might not go back up
Can you still claim BTG from the bitcoin you owned before the fork?
I had mine in exodus wallet at the time.
Is there an exchange I can move it to to get it like with bitcoin cash?
and yes I guess I had done some research when it flopped on it's first try to enter the market, I had no faith in it, just wanted a quick buck
