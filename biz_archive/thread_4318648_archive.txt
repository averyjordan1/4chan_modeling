I noticed a lot of you guys didn't know what ChainLINK would be actually useful for or get too hung up on the "banking" premise that was shilled a lot on /biz/.
Let me explain the TRUE merit of ChainLINK.Bitcoin was the first decentralized currency that was trustless in nature.
Ethereum was the first decentralized smartcontract service that was trustless in nature.ChainLINK is the first "bridge" between real life data and crypto that is decentralized in nature.What does this mean?ChainLINK can take real time datastreams like Sensor data/non-crypto financial data such as real time interest rates etc and combine it with smartcontracts.https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaperhttps://www.americanbanker.com/news/the-race-to-connect-smart-contracts-to-the-real-world American Banker
