Reminder: 60M tether printed yesterday.

Do you have your BTC at the ready to be sold then moment that happens?
Because BTC going down is going to pull everything with it
Must be hard being a brainlet.
Thing about BTC is that you cant time anything anymore due to poor transaction times, im thinking about going out of btc and hedging with futures as OP, im just to fucking greedy to do it today, or tomorow i guess :(
