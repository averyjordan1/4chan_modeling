If you have a liqui account you should have another 500 from a while back.
Just forget about them.
I think TRON is legit but it's going to be a while before anything happens.
It's not worth selling them for a few pennies now.
Is it worth buying?
Just "a few pennies", as you say.
why were they given out in the first place?
i don't have a liqui account
this is what i want to know
I also have it in my binance.
Checking liqui now
Me too
Oh shit, yeah I have 500 too.
Sweet, free internet monies.
I'm really starting to like Binance.
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?
its an airdrop to promote their coin, not worth selling it for pennies.
be happy you have it and hold for a year or two
thank you
This thread kek
got it on liqui and binance also.
