So this coin already got pumped on the weekend but it stayed solid on 0.00075/0.00080 after the massive dump in the last days.Their community is still thinking this is something huge, lets pump the shit out of this one again.
(Circulating supply 2,010,000 ZCG) tomorrow they will burn another 500k of their token supply.
LEEEEEEETS GOOOOOO https://etherdelta.com/#ZCG-ETH
I'm ont it
NEO Gold is way better, and already on coinexchange just waiting activation.
I've made so much money off these "gold" scamcoins this month.
NEO Gold is tempting but the market cap already seems quite high.
its not even on CE yet, once it gets activated there it will x10.https://twitter.com/NEO_GOLD_com/status/930465734572027904
Market cap is already over 2 million.
This thing isn't going to a 20 million market cap.x2 and x3 are definitely feasible, but it's always a big gamble with these types of shitcoins.
I made x2 on ZCG but the market cap was extremely low when I bought it.
devs will burn 25mil tokens so supply will go /2
