I have a bachelors degree in Finance, I have a job that's good for now, but it's kind of a dead end and nothing to do with Finance.
Would it be a good idea to go to community college and get an associates degree in Information Technology?
No, IT is a dying field
is it really though?
no kidding?
wtf is IT degreeDo an actual engineering degree if you're going to touch computers properly.
CS/CE/EE/SE/etc.
Go get a Finance job then noob
he's right.
it's basically a service job now.
figure out a way to get into crypto with your degree.
a lot of institutions are getting into this sector.
Don’t do it I just finished my associates in Information Technology with recruiters lining up with job offers.
I took the one that paid the highest and so far it’s been pretty comfy and I feel bad for people that went and got their bachelors because I make more than them.
I work in IT, never bothered with the degree.
read 70-640 or whatever the current edition is.
build a home lab.
if you don't enjoy it don't work in the field because it can be hell.
You would be better off going to a reputable coding bootcamp for 3 months.
I know so many people that have done this and have gotten amazing jobs.
this really isn't just a meme?
