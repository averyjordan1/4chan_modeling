Would a friendly anon be willing to explain Tether to me?
Curious to hear the opinions of detractors and defenders.
Is it a ponzi?
Is there a concern that the money is not actually being held?
If Tether falls apart, what happens to the price of BTC, and what kind of an event would cause it to fail?
Every tether is "backed" by real USD.
But they were only audited when they were small.
Now many people are curious who is suddenly betting against BTC to the tune of 170 mil in a day.The problem with tether is we basically have to trust they aren't doing the central bank thing and just printing more tether.
It makes me really nervous because it's just the kind of thing that is ripe for abuse with no one knowing.
Thanks anon.
So they may just be "printing" bs tethers.
Seems scary indeed.
In the event that they just dip out Mt Gox-style, and tethers are no longer redeemable, how cataclysmic will the damage be given their 600 mil+ market cap?
