Does anyone know why Binance does this?
It lets me buy all I can, but only lets me sell to rounded numbers.
So fucking obnoxious.
It really bothers me too.
They need to fix this.
If they won't let us sell whole thing why are they making us buy it.
Open a support ticket everyone.
Tell them to fix this shit.
I wish there was a way to just burn the balance in the wallet if its , so hideous to look at
This really fucking bothers me too
Not sure why they opted for that system, but they are implementing better ways of handling it.
"Dust sweet" allows you to convert you coin "dust" into other coins for example.
dust sweep** According to their reddit ti should be implemented soon enough.
how I can snort this dust?
