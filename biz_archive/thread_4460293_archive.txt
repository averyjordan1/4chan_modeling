Buy the dips if you like money.I have nothing to gain by shilling a $1B+ market cap coin on biz.
Just saying that this has gone up about ~40% in a week and keeps finding new levels of support.
We'll be reaching new ATHs within a week.
I want biz to succeed.
Quit buying total shit coins and buy something with a clear and obvious future.
