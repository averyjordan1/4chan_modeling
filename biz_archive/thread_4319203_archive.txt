I dunno, btc is slow as fuck and it's losing big name supporters, i think bcc can challenge it a little more, remember we had another bcc pump yesterday, actually there's been 3 bcc pumps in the last 3 days so it might not be over.
it isnt.it will pump again today and Monday it will finally crush BTC in the GRAVE

idiots.greed and stupidityi mean crypto is so fast if you missed your rocket and haven't bought on a safe level just wait a week and get in another oneit's not like you have to wait months or years for another opportunity like in regular marketsright now there are dozens promising coins to buy cheap - all that bch volume will flow somewhere else in a few days
>tfw don't even have $100 to afford crypto>people bragging about spending $2000+ on crypto makes my heart hurt
Big name supporter
nigga you stupid and poor.

I bought at ATH last night (700 coins) and it's at $6200+ already!
I heart BTC!
im not a shill, i just have an iq above 60. look i feel for you really i do, but you have to do better in the future
Bought at 2500, spent all my 15 bitcoins, I really hope the flippening is happening or I will have to off myself
sure it'll probably go back up to 2k, i wouldn't even be surprised.

The two on the right are fine, would bang any one of them desu, including the one on the left.
BCH will hit 3k in 2 days, screencap this
Next year yes it will.....
I believe bitcoin will go up alot more in that time as well
>bitcoin cash ATH @$2700Am I missing something here?
Coinmarketcap says the highest it went was $1953
BCH will be at $600 in 3 days.
Screencast this.
I bought BCH at 900 back in the last pump and watched it go down to 300 but now I'm swimming in gains.
Just keep hodling anon.
