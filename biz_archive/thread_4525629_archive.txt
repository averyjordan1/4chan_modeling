Is it too late to buy Ethereum, how high is this shit going to go?
$
300, whee it belongs
Its not late - perfect time to buy - especially with institutional investors jumping in a few months
Do not buy.
It'll be dumping soon enough.
It will be the backbone of web 3.0.
Didn't you fucking do your research?
It's going to be the biggest shit in crypto.
And you retards sold it below 300$
Remember when eth was .15 for the longest time?We're going back to the good ole days.
going back to .7 then eventually to break ath of .15, im thinking .2 within a year or two is very possible.
espcially with pos sharding casper raiden all the goodshit.
by then dapps that been being developed for over a year or two will start coming out.
eth will be the crypto for everything
BUY HIGH
I just bought ETH at ath so it's going to nose dive.
Sorry guys
