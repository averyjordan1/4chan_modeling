I hereby pledge to never buy Confido the scamwho is with me
If you missed the ICO 10x, there's no point.
>Buying anything when it's already some 10x the ICO priceHitting myself for not knowing it existed until earlier today, but it's still principle to never buy high.
I bought at 10x ICO and sold at 17x ICO.
sucks for you guys.
I'll buy back in when it drops to 8x ICO too.
Literally accumulating, most people had 2 ether in it, so what.
