To do trades only using Shapeshift or is it better to use an exchange?
I know that Shapeshift has higher fees but is it still possible to make a good profit using it instead of a regular exchange?
dunno sounds crazy to me
You mean like with Exodus/Eden?
I do it sometimes.
But I wouldn't use it to day trade.
