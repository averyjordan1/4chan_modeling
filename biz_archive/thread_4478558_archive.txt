no
imagine trying this hard to make an unfunny shitpost
Chainlink is expected to exceed the current ETH marketcap in about two years
It's pretty sad when a literal scamcoin BTFO LINK.
only really good coins get beaten down this hard initially.
big money is as patient as they are allowed to be and doesn't pay more than they have to.
the insane hype for link made it even worse this time.
I still think it's THE next thing (just hard to say when)
expected
Chainlink beats eth>Confido rebounds to 160b marketcap in 6months>bitconnect becomes the new btc>Warren Buffet's mentor is resurrected based on blockchain code > recommends to buy ODN, verge, Ark all > 30k per coin in Q1 2019
