But this is the crypto world and the crypto world does not make any sense.
Bitcoin is a true shitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash is in the midst of a breakout.
Now the price moves in narrow range between 1200.00 and 1120.00 levels.
MACD lines stay at the signal level and itâ€™s an additional confirmation of range market conditions.
However, on Nov. 25th, a major portion of hash rate will be moving over to BCH.
We should be ready to see a breakout above the borders.
It will give us a new trading opportunity.
As we can make profit, we should place buy orders to break 1200.00 resistance level.
once past the 1200, the first profit targets are 1400.00 and 1600.00 levels.
So the BCH trolls are getting ready again
I like that they can't use the "expensive fees" excuse, since now the fees are like $0.5 or less (as long as your wallet is not retarded at calculating the fees).Network hashpower is now normal, so transaction fees are also back to normal.LN testing is also going well, and we might see it much earlier than expected
>Satoshi's vision

just a remind, OP is a raging faggot.
Bcash is not the real bicoin.
It's a fork.
It has no devs.
It has script kiddies.
it has faggots.
You're a faggot for falling for this trash.
your leader is a faggot who sells shit on ebay!
he is not technical.
He knows nothing about how bitcoin actually works.
