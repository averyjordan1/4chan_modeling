Started with $400 in May and been adding 1k monthly.
This is the get out of workforce card.
Got lucky with NEO.
Congrats OP.
This is the larp card
why aren't you collecting gas?
converting to NEO
i've been at it since 2014

Quite a bit of my stack was acquired through trading.
Got +17% by flipping BCH 20min before fork
Why?
Elaborate?
what part?
NEO = Get GASSell GAS = Get more NEOMore NEO = Get more GASSell more GAS = Get even more NEO...
on what exchange?
I have dot-something NEOs left on bitfinex and was thinking about doing the same to have at least a whole neo to move it on my wallet
I made a lot on NEO but sold at $34.
OP where do you see the price next year?
can someone explain how this is sustainable?
what happens when all the gas is generated
answered your own question
eventually NEO holders will get GAS not through generation but through fees of people using the network
