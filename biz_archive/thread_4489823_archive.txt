You gonna have to carry that weight first if you want to be rich.
>tfw calculated all the money I "could" have made this year
 It's depressing desu.
I could have retired instead I gambled my life savings on shitcoins and now I've nearly lost everything in the wake of this seemingly perpetual bitcoin bull run.
All I had to do was hodl my btc and id be rich.
Instead I gambled my btc away on worthless shitcoins and now ive lost all my btc and with it my will to live desu.
Im hanging on by a thread as I desperately cling onto the quickly waning hope that someday my shitcoins will recover.
I bagholded a coin for 3 months but I eventually recovered.
Just be patient bud
iktf
I'm in the same, I should have never fucked around with shitcoins and stayed in BTC.
All you fucking faggots got spoiled because of late last year and beginning of this year with your fucking 10x profits fuck you
the brainlet mindset
You missed some good shitcoins that has mooned like XMR, BCC, and BLOCK.
Now's the good time to dump BCC if you still hold those.
You don't have to stay in BTC.
Lots of excellent concepts now compared to altcoins 2 years ago.
Next year might be the lucky break for altcoiners if they're willing to wait.
