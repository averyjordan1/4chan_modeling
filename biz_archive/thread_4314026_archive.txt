+$350 in one hour.
If you had bought 1 hour ago, you would have made $350 for each BCH purchased.
This shit is going to be at $7k in 1-2 days.
If you're still holding bitcoin, you're retarded.
Up another $150 since I made this post a few minutes ago.
Anyone who isn't buying right now is being left behind.
I feel now is the time to sell, and usually the advice I give anyone other than myself is spot on
ETH is going down btc will go up
Yeah now would be a good time to sell bch and move back into btc.
You're crazy if you think the bch will take over.
and they call linkies deludes hah
advice I give to others is spot onMfw told all my friends bch was a good buy at 900 and I didn’t buyMfw told everyone bitcoin was going to 5k the moment it dropped under 7Mfw I’ve been sitting here staking ark for the past two weeks doing nothing else
this ain't your blog, faggot
tfw you're rebecca's diary.
I said it was a good buy at 700, after S2X was cancelled the writing was on the wall.But /biz/ would only go on about how it was a shitcoin, and how it was a pump dump.
