Why the fuck so you think he's gonna dump it?
Maybe he's just going to buy a shitload of BCH.
Thats a dumping
he is a huge supporter of BCH, he is going to sell all his BTC for BCH
Here is what he is going to do:1. long BCH/BTC pair with 12.5 K bitcoins2.
then dump 12.5K bitcoins to make huge profit from his long position
What the hell are the withdraw limits on Bitfinex?
That's 151 million dollars more or less depending on how he trades.
Wait what does this mean?
Roger Ver owns bitcoin.com and is a huge bch supporter, it means he is about do dumb all that btc for bch and end this shit
*dump :)
good time to enter bch now?
I don't think Ver and Jihan are done yet.
being this obtuse
Worry not.
Tx won't confirm
it's already confirmed faggothe paid a very high fee so it's processed quickly
More than 70% of the hashrate are moving to BCH after the fork tomorrow.
This was part of a behind-doors deal between miners if 2X didn't succeed.Bitcoin's going to have it's tx capacity slugged out for two weeks.
Severely.
It's confirmed.
Did he already sell it or nah?
How else did it get to 3000
Now we need to know if he's gonna buy ETH or BCH.
He already bought BCH with it.
He's withdrawing the remaining BTC so he doesn't wind up homeless.
See this tweet:https://twitter.com/windsok/status/929626408753627136
The price is dipping right now if he already bought this shit is done for
