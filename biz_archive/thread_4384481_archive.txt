So now that LINK and REQ are in regular communication with each other, any chance we can make/force the LINK team to communicate like them?>Anon: Why dont you guys follow the REQ team who has weekly updates and actively seeks exchanges?>Rory: You see, we prefer to act professionally and focus on launching the main net>Anon: Rory just said the REQ team is acting unprofessionally and isnt focusing on their product!>Rory: No.. no.. i didnt.... ok we'll start acting like them too.
Stop expecting daily detailed updates about everything.
This isn't how investing works.
That's sometimes how scammers try to string you along actually, lol
Really?
not even actively seeking exchanges?
Why does the REQ team do it huh?
The REQ team actually has more than two people on it.
I'm fine with little communication from the LINK team
