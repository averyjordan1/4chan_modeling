What do you guys think of Stellar Lumens?
My brother is looking to invest in them as a high risk high reward type of crypto.
Market cap is too big to be high reward.
Medium reward, maybe, but high reward no.
Just because a coin is cheap doesn't make it any more likely to double than a big coin, it is all about the market cap.
If you want a high risk, high reward coin, look at a coin with a low market cap that looks promising
DisagreeThe total circulating supply is 1/2 of Ripple.
It could be & likely will be in a 20+ cent per coin range by early next year.
FWIW Ripple was .007 this time last year.
I think your brother is correct and it is a great investment.
bought 300k myself, would buy more if I was richer
