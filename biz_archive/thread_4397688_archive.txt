How long does this last?
I'm just about over it.
I made 20 ETH this week off shitcoins but all my med-long term hodls are dying.
Next change I get I'm getting rid of all these shit alts.
Big money doesn't care about alts.
Which is absolutely retarded as its theoretically the best way to accumulate more btc.
Unfortunately, the big money views it as an investment and not fast money.
