WHY ISNT THE METAVERSE WALLET ON HITBTC WORKING?!?!?!
I CAN'T MOVE MY META FROM BITFINEX AND THEY WILL BLOCK US CUSTOMERS FROM WITHDRAWING TOMORROW!!
WHY.
No fucking Way
works fine for me?do you have a negative balance on bitfinex?
if so you need to sell some ETP to cover the negative USD balance.
put it in a personal wallet until it's fixed at hitbtc.
or sign up for the webwallet betahttps://www.reddit.com/r/Metaverse_Blockchain/comments/7bju7g/volunteer_recruitment_for_metaverse_web_wallet/
NOT THE BITFINEX WALLET, THE HITBTC WALLET ISN'T WORKING!!
IT SAYS UNAVALIABLE
HELLLLPPPPP.....
HITBTC NOT WORKING = PEOPLE WILL SELL ETP FOR USD.
HUGE CRASHING INCOMING.

I TRIED AND SENT 2 EPT TO TEST BUT 4 HOURS LATER ITS STILL NOT SHOWING UP FUUUUUCKKKK
