>he bought bch at 0.3
I bought it at 0.38 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I bought a lot at .08. and more at varying levels up to .3and I'm not fucking selling
You will sell soon kek.
There is "some" hope if exchanges add markets for BCH/BCC that would make it not dependent on bitcoin anymore.It also needs hashpower to survive, the new fork should address some of those concerns but without mare trading pairs this coin will get nowhere.I still support them regardless of price, I want nothing to do with lightning BSThe only markets right now are:BCH-ETHBCH-BTCBCH-USDTBCH-LTC...It needs it's own market
>not buying it at 0.459 to sell it at 0.2205
I bought at .1 still holding

At least you guys aren't that whale who bought 1000+ at .50You think you lost a lot of money?
That guy lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions
