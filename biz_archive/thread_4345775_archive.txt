I've found a forex trading strategy with at least 66%, and up to 92%, success rate.
AMA.
how does dick taste?
Except fine details of the strategy.
I won't give that away.
coarse details then?
Which indicators do u use and which trading pairs?
So when are you going to jail, and when will you tell us about it?
Why the fuck would you be posting here?
You would be busy man.
Indicators are bs imo because the only input into them is what is going on in the charts.
Every pair where a perfect open position is occuring.
Highest success rates, above 90%, are in USDJPY and EURJPY.
Lowest in NZDUSD and EURUSD, around 66%
So Ichimoku cloud on 4h?
