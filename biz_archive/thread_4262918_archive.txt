>TA doesn't wor-
I've seen this kind of thing before.
How can you predict if its going to break up or down?
bitcoin is dumping faster than when china banned exchanges the flippening may unironically occur
It's a continuation pattern.
u dont.. u only know that once it breaks out that pattern, a new pattern has emerged.
so if ur smart, u can make a stop loss below that pattern.
BTC price estimate by 2019LOW:3500HIGH:85000Now.
The real question.
Are you willing to risk a 4k loss?
Anyone know why it's being dumped this hard?

Sometimes it works, other times it doesnt.
You're better off knowing it than not.
Obvious bear trap
the only reason BTC went parabolic was because dipshits thought it would be BCH all over again and wanted in on that sweet B2Xnow that segwit2x is not happening there's no reason for BTC to even be at this price in the first place, it should be like ~$5k right now, hopefully it crashes back to that range soon
You can't.Look up apophenia
congrats, 50/50 chance and the 50 event took place.
breathtaking.
the chances are never 50/50
