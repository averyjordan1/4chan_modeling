>letting normies have my BTCnot likely
I bet the startups cut is astronomical.
The only problem I see it... why would they pay with a debt card and wait for the BTC transaction to happen?
it takes ages.
And on the internet, why not pay directly with the wallet?
this is the only problem I see.
Are you fucking retarded?
There are dozens of companies doing this already.
Monaco even has the card out.
Which only works in Singapore
