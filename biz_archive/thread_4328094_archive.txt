How do you guys keep track of prices?I still have no idea how people find it easier to talk in sats instead of USD or some other currency when sat prices are always changing relative to BTC changes.
Do you guys always just have a satoshi converter open or am I missing something here?
do you know how to do math?well, do some math
Just don't even look at USD prices.
Accumulating btc/eth is all that matters
quit trying to measure things in dollars.
BTC or whatever replaces it if there is going to be a replacement, is the future of currency.
You will buy things in Satoshi.
Reeeeeeeeeeee
What math am I looking to do?So it's less about net value in currency but just more about BTC amounts?
I've never really looked at it that way
I don't know what you mean.
1 sat always equals 1/10,000,000 of a bitcoin.
To determine what the dollar value of 1 sat is do (coin price USD*.0000001)
Actually I think this is missing a digit.
add a zero before the 1
Btc price is starting to matter less and less.
Better to look at USD price at the moment.
Once most exchanges have BCH trading pairs (probably 6-12 months) BCH price will be the standard.
jihan pls go
That would make sense only if the prices are stable, but the fact is BTC's price is very unstable despite having the largest market cap of all crypto.
Once most exchanges have BCH trading pairs (probably 6-12 months)Very likely> BCH price will be the standardVery far fetched.
