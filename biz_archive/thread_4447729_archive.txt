The FUD is that the recent pump is because of government speculation and that it is likely that some american faggot will get access to that information.They basically confirmed that it isnt related to the government.
How is that fucking ending the FUD?
This shit is going to dump.
Sell the news is fucking real.
Sound like gas is a better buy
*it isnt likely
the real news is going to be about a partnership with LRC and the launching of the new exchange.
smart money is loading up on that
H7LCmNOJIt was pumping before the meme of the government lifting ico bans came out.
This.People sell the news even if its good news because thats what has always happened and real investors dont want to get dumped on.
If you are a fanboy, just pull your NEO out for a day and buy MORE tomorrow after the news.If you are in this for the pump, get out soon lol.
The majority of the pump is finished and all thats left is the correction when NEO doesnt announce they are the sole crypto of China.

In neo and gas atm, gas always folllows the neo trend, but in bigger swings.
Neo is the safer buy, but if announcement is actually big, there's money to be made in gas
