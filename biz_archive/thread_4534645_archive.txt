But eventually this coin will take off just like NEO.
The $4 previous ATH was just the beginning.
where to buy?
It's NXS on bittrex
want makes you think this will moon again?
seems like typical hype to me
Because they're going to launch a swarm of satellites LMAO.
Actual frequent updates, working on getting added to a lot of exchanges, lots in the pipeline, and it's a low supply coin with a lot of people watching it waiting to see what will happen.
It's definitely one of the more interesting/unique cryptos, the 3D blockchain will be much bigger than the satellites
its mooning rn
