how do I know who is shilling and who is helping?
/biz/ is all shills and thrills
Pick 1 random comment out of every 100 you read and trust them.
good to see which ones to avoid
this.still better odds than the lottery though.
Buy kneepads, suck 5 dicks.
Divide the number of dicks you suck by the number of dicks that cum in your mouth within 1 minute.
Then, multiply 100 by that fraction.
That is the percentage of posters that you can trust.
I will always have a teal ID, so you will know it's me when I post LINK threads
They say, it in the thread if they are shilling or if they are real.
you can trust al of these anons anon,
Do your own research.
It's quite obvious to see what's being shilled.
>Check how active the development of the coin is>Check how active and supportive the community is>Check the legitimacy of the future prospects of the coin, eg partnerships and government support>Check the teams qualifications out>check if the coin itself is undervalued.
If you see three or more threads using the coin's logo and they are shilling, then don't buy.
Does someone tell you to buy something with zero actual logical reasoning?
They shilling bruh
nobody here does any deep research or they would have bought SLR way before PBC shilling.it's about as good as a project gets and these fools call it a shitcoin every day.
laughing all the way to "low earth orbit"
