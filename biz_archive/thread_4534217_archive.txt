Hey all, new sub to here but have been trading for a bit now.
I've searched high and low for a good litecoin specific discord/slack and haven't found one.
I've found quite a few crypto discords but anything that was or could have been specific to litecoin has been converted to a generalized crypto discussion and trading platform.Talking about trading litecoin is too slow via reddit, 4chan or other forum type communities, having a chat will help everyone be aware of trends and possibilities.After searching for discord channels via the subreddit and google I figured Litecoin could use one for traders specifically.
One where traders could discuss the market, trade fills, and general direction.
I have really enjoyed trading thus far but have realized there's so much to learn and this would be a way to help others like myself learn and help contribute to the growth of litecoin overall.The idea behind this isn't to have a litecoin pump and dump, it's more to collaborate and call out signs of a good market to buy or when it's a potential buy/sell opportunity.
Anyways, i'm running out of steam here but anyone is welcome.
Ideally it isn't a place to spam, shill, or distract but to learn and profit together.https://discord.gg/DJ6jdMFHope to see you there!
