guys pls helpi just sent a substantial amount of USDT from hitbtc to some other exchange, the USDT went out of hitbtc but never arrived...did i do it wrong?
are USDT even meant to be sent like that?pic unrelated
>he owns USDTWhy not just ethereum?
It's always worth at least 300USD.
i sold eth into usdt and wanted to send it somewhere else to buy it back cheaper
Send 1% and wait to see if it arrives.
If it does send the other 99%.
Sorry.
It went to my wallet, thanks OP.
but fucking exchange fees, i hate that shitim sure someone else has done this, did the funds ever arrive?
what do?
There's some weird conspiracy that Bitfinex counterfeits USDT and they will exit scam some time in the future, idk.Better don't hold or try to send USDT, that's all I know.
so noone has ever done this to shed some light onto it?
