I agree with you, we have to give the team much time for development in accordance with their road map.
We must aware that everything can't be done at once, we must be patient and keep monitoring the progress
The great project CND will soon continue, we will get many surprises, let's wait and still keep our CND and see what will happen.

I have a very big confidence in this wonderful project we need time , the developers I trust with my money
It is time we are patient, can only wait CND will go into the larger exchangers and we see the price will surely increase ;~)
It is a smart move to wait for other big exchanges!
I am very sure they have a delayed release to go on this nice exchange (aka Binance , aka Bittrex) so they can create some hype :-)
