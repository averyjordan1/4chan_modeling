Hypothetically let's say Bitcoin starts dumping and never stops.
What does that mean to the rest of the crypto market ?
Same crash, but worse.
we'll tell you when that's going to happen https://discord.gg/tdNw5Vp
If Coinbase/GDAX delivers by offering more fiat pairs for alts, who knows?Bitcoin could fade into obscurity without crashing the rest of the market if it stops being the primary base pair.
Pajeet pleaze
Realistically, I think it's not the end of crypto but a transformation.
BTC has the most recognition, but I wouldn't call ETH too far behind.
It would be a slow bleed, maybe 3-6 months to go from ~$8,000 to something like $2,000 realistically.
In that time, any intelligent investor would realize that this would mean ALTs would absorb practically all of the market cap contained in BTC.
ETH would probably take on an additional ~10-15 Billion market share, putting it around ~45-48 Billion.
finally BitConnect scam would die, that money too would be evaporated into ALTs.
Good day for NEO.
Overall market cap of crypto might fall, but I would be highly confident it would only transform into an ICO golden age again.
Crypto winter for another two years
Alt coin revoluci√≥n
we will do our pump and dumps even harder lmao motherfuckershttps://discord.gg/NsUxZn9
