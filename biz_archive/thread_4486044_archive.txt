Modum or Vechain?
VEN has better partnerships.
I sold my Modum as the only use for the token is the dividends.
Dividends aren't set in stone and are decided by the board.
If you're going to hold a security you might as well be in the equities market where there are regulations that protect the investor.
Out of those two it’s Modum, but you should check out ShipChain as it already has billion dollar shipping corporation partnered with it.
ICO isn’t for a few months tho
Mods, this girl not Asian.
Please ban
