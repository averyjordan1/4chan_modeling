Why can't Bitcoin swap to a proof of stake system like Ethereum plans to?
Because it won't be BTC anymore.
It will be just another fucking fork.
And even if the ppl that claim to be the current BTC devs support this decision, there'll be a chink who'll claim that *it is no true BTC anymore* and fud the pos transition claiming only pre-fork technology supported by him is viable.
meanwhile, the *original* BTC guyz will say that they think otherwise now seeing the community has split.
Normies lose their shit and go in alts, all btc and forks die out.
The end.That is why not.
Normies think there is something magical about the way BTC without actually knowing how it works
there's nothing wrong with PoW.
i love when people whine about "muh energy consumption" like they would ever give a shit about it under any other circumstance, like their A/C in the summer.
I'd choose the A/C that consumed 1000x less energy
what about the recent highs of $20 transaction fees?
The thing is pow makes you lose money to get money.Pos rewards you with money for having money.You see why ppl think pow is wrong?
