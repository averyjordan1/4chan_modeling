wonderful coin for short term and especially long term compared to steem such a beautiful market cap definitely undervalued atm thank you for the informative post coin burn will surge the price but long term is also ideal
I'm holding a lot of this.
It has decent volume on even low-tier exchanges.
Once it hits a better exchange, or especially a Japanese exchange, this price will look very cheap.
Just look at the MonaCoin chart.
Yup I'm thinking of holding a big part till they add on a japanese exchange
