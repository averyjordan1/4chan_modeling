watch VTC jump 10% in the next 30min.This coin will not stop, get on for your own financial safety
Skeptical but watching
Don't watch other wise it will be too late
Can confirm don't buy if you hate money
If you don't buy VTC then you obviously hate money.
Dev team is awesome and plenty of potential.
It broke north of its meme triangle, but it's still slow.The massive sell wall is probably pretty intimidating to most people
Internet cares about my financial safety.. so cool!
halving in december btw so get in before
grs better version of vtc desu, the supply inflation is way less, first to have lightning first to do atomic swaps first to have segwit activated.
grs > vtc

What, BTC is preparing another inside fagottry like yesterday?
People are getting tired of that shit thats why projects like VTC have future.
When btc start crashing vtc and all other alts will follow.
It's inevitable and happened time after time.
not necessarily, VTC's pump prior to this one happened during a BTC crash
