kek, it's unironically the best exchange though, just wish they had more volume and coins.
yep just need more time for the volume to get better and im impressed with how often they add coins.
its been daily new listings for a bit now.
4390368I find the interface cleaner and faster than a lot of other exchanges as well.
I'm pretty happy with them.
BTW everybody get the airdrop today?
It was my first!
BNB is the easiest coin ever to swingtrade.
and the waves are super big too
No matter how many times it happens, I'll always be amazed when I get an airdrop.
It's just a shame that the TRX or whatever it is, is too small to trade
between what range?
Zero fees feels pretty nice too, shame it's only for a week
How and why airdrops happen?
Sometimes it'll be because you're holding a certain coin when big forks occur and other times it could be from promotional things which is what I think TRX is since you can't actually trade the amount that they give you
>Binins
.5$ to 2$
>binanceoh fug, he's right!
pink interface, doesnt zoom out all the way>no stops>cant set the valur of either trading pairits shit
It's certainly better than Kraken.
Is anything as shit as Kraken?
Only thing holding them back is that terrible chart.
They need to link up with trading view
>binanceAbsolute shite Can't make huge gainz like bittrex
IS BNB really mooning finally??
kek this thread is still going?
quality shitpost
binance really needs to implement stop orders.
Only then will it be truly great
