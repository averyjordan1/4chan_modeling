time for another "what you gon do when you make it" LINK thread.me?
I'm gonna take a loooooooong vacation.
Should we just have a /LINK General/?
Buy a new apartment and car.
Probably get some new clothes and computer/phone
No one is gonna make it holding this shitcoin, ICO to $0.50 was your only chance anon
Hopefully my brother and I will have enough money to go halves on a 4-600k house for our parents back in our old hometown, where they were happy and had friends.
Then I'll travel the world with my comfy stack, search for love, and hopefully settle down.
My life will be an endless vacation
