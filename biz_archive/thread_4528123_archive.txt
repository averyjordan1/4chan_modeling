I believe Moirai is no scam, I conclude this based on their LinkedIn Profiles, the founder has according to his profile extensive experience with trusted brands and a solid educational background.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-taylor-a2bb54151/He also has people who ''testified'' for his skills , over 50 people have.
I think there's a lot of FUD being created by competitors.
I must admit that I was already invested before reading all the scam accusations.
I haven't been scammed so far so lets hope I'm right.
