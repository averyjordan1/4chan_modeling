lying this much to appease cognitive dissonanceSAD!
The 3 hours / avg block is false, but the unconfirmed transactions increase is true.
The queue is insanely large now.
If hashrate drops further there's going to be a massive problem.
Imo there already is a massive problem, but a few more large pools and/or mining farms ditching BTC now could be chain stalling to the point that people panic sell BTC while they still can.
miners flexing.we have a secret up our sleeve the chinese dont know about.
12-24 hours if it keeps up like this.
DELET
