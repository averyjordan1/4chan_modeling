DRINK FOR LINK

I think it is time we seriously look into charging Sergay and Rory with fraud.
The lack of updates suggest no work is being done.
They had no team.
This most likely is a huge criminal en-devour.
Also look at the evidence.
At the last conference it was obvious that Sergay used the 33 million he stole from us to buy twinkies.
At least when they go to arrest him he can't run away.
