Is holding Bitcoin safe right now?
tether if normiebch if big dik btc if cuck
truthExcept you probably want to use (t)ether(300usd).
Tether uses the bitcoin blockchain and there's something very fishy going on in general with issuance of tether.
no hashrate can permanently leave btc meaning you will not be able to sell you don't have to go in bch but holding btc is legitimately dangerous at the moment
it has probably never been more unsafe
also truth

I suggest you cash out to USD and wait until this whole shit blows over first.
nothin personnel...kid
Safer than selling at a loss!
Just sit tight and ride out this madness.
All will be well again soon enough.
You better at least make sure your BTC is on an exchange so you can be ready if you need to sell it without having it lost in the blockchain forever (give it a high fee)
Probably the most unsafe time to hold bitcoin.
Your options:1- Go fiat or get tether.2- Buy eth (pretty stable right now)3- Keep your bitcoin on an exchange and wait.If bitcoin fails big, then option 2 and 3 are still unsafe.
Think abour your faith in crypto.
