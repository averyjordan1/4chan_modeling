mean chainlink will moon?
I THINK he meant etp can do all of those things

Except the built-in ETP oracle (assuming its finished in 2020) requires you to use the ETP blockchain.
Enterprises cannot use it unless they build the smart contracts on top of ETP.Meanwhile LINK currently allows you to use the BTC, ETH, and Hyperledger blockchains.
