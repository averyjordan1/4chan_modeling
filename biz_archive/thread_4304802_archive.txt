Makes sense to me
I literally have never sent a letter in my life where the fuck do you even buy stamps
But then how will he find them???
what is a stamps?
post-office
How many years will this boi be doin?
His bail was revoked after he posted a tweet offering $5,000 for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair.Corrupt judge called him a "danger to the community"
Jesus dude how old are you?
So i have to go and wait in line for ever just to buy some fucking stamps?
How has this system not been upgraded
Looking at least until Jan 16 of 2018 in this facility waiting for sentencing.
After that... could be as much as 20 years.
Hahahahaha 20 years, albo anon will be free in 2018.
Send him some lube... Hes gonna need it
bittrex doesn't even list stamps lmao
DESU i might actually try and penpal this guy.
Truly a patriot.
line?
Lmao nobody goes to the post-office bro just go get a few stamps.
I thought the same thing but he is going to get so much hate mail from poor people that he will never open our letters expecting them to be written by stupid barely literate people.
LSD in prisonSounds awful.
Although there probably isn't much else to do.
