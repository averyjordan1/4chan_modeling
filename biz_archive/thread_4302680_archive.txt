Time to move from B Cash to Eth?
nah, it's xmr's turn bitch.>inb4 ICOs dump eth back to 300
ETH has been range bound oscillating around 300 for awhile now.
Reliably enough to keep buy/sell accumulating.
I've made a couple thousand doing this the last month but I wouldn't just park my money there expecting it 2x.
