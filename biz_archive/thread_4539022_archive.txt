Since christmas is coming around and I'm a rich fag, I would like to give my best friend some crypto currency as a present to fuck around with (maybe 50€ worth in total).
What kind of portfolio would you set up for that?
Just BTC?
A stupid shitcoin?
Some OMG and Lisk maybe, with a bit of NEO?Also the Ledger Nano is on sale, is it worth it as a present?
But that shit alone would cost me 50 €, is there a cheaper way to give them the coins in a physical form?
ledger is awesome, although I doubt you'd end up getting it by christmas, I had to wait two months for mine
is there a cheaper way to give them the coins in a physical form?Make a paper wallet and teach them how to use it
Damn that's fucked up.
Why does it take so long?Thought about it as well.
What about a simple USB stick with the private keys on it?
What about a simple USB stick with the private keys on it?That could work, but I would recommend something a little more secure if he intends to get into it on a more permanent basis.
Good point, USB sticks don't last that long right?Thanks man.
Good point, USB sticks don't last that long right?Not only that, but having a private key just sitting there in plain text form can be a security risk if a hacker gets on his computer, for example.
Make sure that after giving him his initial gift that you help him set up a proper wallet with a 12 word phrase etc.
maybe create paper wallets and make sure they know how to actually use it before they use them
BTC paper wallet
