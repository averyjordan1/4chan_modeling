Does this board do anything other than talk about crypto?

They should rename it to /crypt/Nobody care about something else anyway.This board is all about making money, and crypto is the best known current way to earn shitons of it.
Look at how high stratis ripple eth and neo went and you'll see why this board is so obsessed with crypto
MAKING SURE YOU DO YOUR KEGELS EVERY DAY IS IMPORTANT OP.
PRESENTATION AND EXECUTION WITH ANOTHER LOVER CAN DESTROY PARTNERSHIPS AND DEALS.
DO YOUR KEGELS.
Well usually crypto is only 95% of the boards but it 100% on weekends because other markets are closed
people that are "into business" just want to make money.
its only natural that the board ends up being a crypto board
