Hi, Where is the best place to get update information on whats happening at ground level of the S&P500?
Also where can I gain the best understanding of the crypto currency market?
I hear so many people saying the bitcoin/ lightcoin/ wrongcoin market is not worth diving into, but consider we do move in that direction, then which tickers are worth buying?Any other hott rumors I should know about before I go throw all my moneh into waste management?
what does ground level mean?
wtf are you talking about?
you don't "buy" crypto tickers, it's free.
go to the exchange and see the trades real time.
wtf are you talking about?waste management?

Probably Reddit, not trolling either.
by ground level I mean, the most current market happenings, where the wisest tradera hang out, it seems they all hang out here...
I mean what forums web articals and newspapers are best for keeping ahead of the game.
