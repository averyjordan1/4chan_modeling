How long does it take you to choose a coin for short to mid term?
I tend to go all in but it takes me hours every day to rake through the information, the Pajeet hype, the Pump n dump shills.
It ain't easy.
But if it was everyone would be making it.So for me it probably takes 3-5 hours to find a coin for the next day or two.
What about you?
Also do you have a process to sort through coins?
Mine is basically a rotation of Twitter, telegram, slack, and Biz until I find just the right coin.
Same as you anon,Takes me less than two hours because I'm still slightly emotional about it.Rotation between telegram and biz.
Any good twitter or slack resources you know of ?
5 minutes, see coin on /biz/ check graph to see if it is on an up tick, market buy, set sell point 5% higher.
Rinse.
repeat.
Could you share your sources please?It is actually very hard to see if any tip on /biz/ is solid or just pure autism.
>pick random coin from binance>if it dips more than 2% - sell>if it's up less than 5% after 24h - sell>if it's up more than 10% - sell
This is the only Slack channel I browse.https://join.slack.com/t/cryptodogpound/shared_invite/enQtMjU1ODc4NjA4MzU5LWY1OWQwNjRiYjcxYzEzZGM4MTQ3MWU4MGE4OWE3OWMyZjA1YTdmN2U3MTE1MmEwNDZhZDBhMGUxZWYyNWJkMzkI usually just use the group for bitcoin watch channel.
The active traders give good picks every now and then.
Then on telegram.. Pic related.
Twitter I follow @cryptomoriarty @mpovolotski @crypto_brahma but most of my research is looking through the cashtags
