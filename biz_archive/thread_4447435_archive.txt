Flippening requires a flippening in hash rate, not price manipulation.
And it needs to be consistent.
Yes its a second rate coin, just like BTC.
So delusional.Bitcoin Cash is is only non-zero because it's riding on the coattails of Bitcoin's success.
Most of the top 100 coins are many times better.
That means if BCH hurts BTC in an attempt to 'dethrone' it, it undermines itself by harming the confidence in the brand.
And brand is why it has value at all.There is no victory condition with BCH.
The only thing you're doing is sending money to the Chinese.
The win condition is freeing btc from (((blockstreams))) grasp
The crypto market is almost completely valued based on perception.
Bitcoin knockoffs (and the FUD they spawn) undermine the perception of stability in the value store.
There may be well-intention people championing all of this, but if the 'war is won' than there will only be kings of corpses.
