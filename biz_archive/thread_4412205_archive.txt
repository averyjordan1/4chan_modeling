The inevitable rise is in the horizon.
Why haven't you accumulated QTUM yet?
I'm really surprised at how little attention this coin actually gets.
I'm not saying that's bad in any way, it just makes the inevitable mars mission so much bigger when it finally happens.
New people will flood into the market of this coin and finally realise what get they've gotten to know.i mean just look at the volume, the majority comes from Korea and you know who the first people that got hold of Ethereum was?
The Koreans.
They know what's up, and you'll know soon too.This coin is a perfect implementation of both the smart-contract technology of Ethereum and the transaction system of Bitcoin.
That's what we need in the crypto world right now.And I'll also tell you this, QTUM is the Bitcoin of Asia.
this was pumped like 1 day ago, trying to sell your bags?
A coin like this that hasn't been shilled on /biz/ to death yet is always a good choice.
Do you really call that a pump?
