Hello all,I am the legend (some call me a pajeet) that brought you some of the very first shillings of gems like MOD, DOVU, POWR, CFD, NIO, and the past 3 days EPY.Here is my next gem, this is the very first time I am posting it so if you're reading this you're a very lucky person.Horizon State (Decision TKN) - Basically democracy on blockchain to stop fraudTotal supply: 48,000,000Current price: 9-13 centsTeam of professionals and all white malesNot yet listed on CoinmarketcapNot even officially listed on Etherdelta yet (LOL can you say 10x+?
)https://etherdelta.com/#0x554c20b7c486beee439277b4540a434566dc4c02-ETHI have spoken with the devs and confirmed that the ED and CMC listing have both been applied for and the volume is there for the listing on CMC.
It's only a matter of days most likely until the price is 3x of what it is now.Believe me or not, I don't really care.
Just trying to help you guys make money (and obviously make myself money because I bought in before you, but I deserve that little extra for doing the research).Strategy: HOLD until ED/CMC listing + 3-5 days.
(Look at CFD, struggled to break .0022 for days, now nearing .003, learn your lessons.
hold for 10-20x's)
total supply?
How r doin Rakeesh how family how work?
We just leaved india too and coming to america.
Been in this since presale.
Comfiest hold.
kek 1 billion total supply.
Whats the ticker on Etherdelta?
I aint clicking that shit nigga.
They're burning some as they didn't reach cap on the ICO.
Rest is being airdropped to ICO participants to keep the 40/60 split.
This is why I make the money.
I do the research.
It is 48m supply, look at my messages with the dev.There is no ticker yet because it's not officially listed on ED yet.
That's why you're truly on the ground floor.It's okay though, you can try to troll.
I'll be rolling in the money again in 3 days like I am now with EPY.
Reminder to never buy a token if it has > 250 million supply or if the ICO is > 10 MM unless it already has serious support from well-known backers or else you're buying a token that won't go anywhere but down once it hits the market
https://etherdelta.com/#0x554c20b7c486beee439277b4540a434566dc4c02-ETHok why is it called decision token on ED?
burning tokens because shitty ICOs can't sell hahaha pajeet :(
It actually JUST got listed as HST on Etherdelta with ticker.
Better get in quick.
This is step 1.
"Horizon State is a blockchain-based platform and ecosystem that enables efficient vote casting and decision making processes.
The platform operates through the use of Decision Tokens (HST).
These are used for running the decision and voting processes by providing the ‘gas’ for voting and other services within the ecosystem.
Horizon State is currently engaging with governments, large corporations, blue-chip customers, local councils, unions, education facilities and non-profit organisations who will utilise Decision Tokens for polling and voting processes.
New products and services across the ecosystem will require the use of HST, driving the token value and demand.
