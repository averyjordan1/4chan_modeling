Hey guys it's me again just stopping in to let you know that ODN released it's first update to it's blockexplorer today in the form of a rich list.
Every day Obsidian devs release new updates on GitHub and the coin is set up to explode over the next 2 months.
They have stated new exchanges will be pursued starting December 4th with the relaunch.
If you want a comfy hold with 5-10x gains ODN is an easy choice.
