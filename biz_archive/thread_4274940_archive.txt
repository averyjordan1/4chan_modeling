if you want actual events with source just check out:www.coincalendar.info
the number of events on your list should clue you in about how impactful most of these events are going to be for price

Thanks for linking to that site, anon.
I think I'll be using it quite a bit :)
They can have an impact in a 'sell the news' kind of way.
Depends on community expectations.
ive been following the news for a year.
conferences, meetings and conventions are literally worthless.
just follow the software and hardware related news.
any coin that needs to do a burn is toast
What about coin burns?
Alis is doing one in a week.
coin burn is a software update.
so its important.
Thanks again.
Please share more useful sites and tips!
Yeah i also agree conferences are shite, never add value only tank if they're bad haha.
Thanks for the coincalender link, very useful
