I have 5BTC ($41k) to invest.
What do I buy?You're going to think I'm stupid, but this is my life savings.
I'm tired of working 60 hours a week and barley being able to save anything.
This 41K was from saving for 5 years and it's only that much because Bitcoin moon'd so hard over the past few months.I want to go into an alt, hit a 5x, cash out and live off this money until I can find a job that doesn't kill me or will let me go back to school.Thanks Biz.
why dont you just work this job for the next 2 years put everything into bitcoin and ethereum and then profit in 2 years and not worry for the rest of life?
Just saying 30k 2 years ago now is a few mil
buy BCHdouble your profits in the next 24 hours
Put 1 BTC into DNA, spread the others.
The DNA will come through by Christmas for sure
Indeed, go for this OP

There won't be a flippening, main stream media has it's attention on Bitcoin not cash.
Most people think BCH is a scam.
