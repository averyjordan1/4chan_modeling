What's another nice stable coin to store your gains in now that ETH is going nuts?
one is chinese and the other one is a pedo.
Who do you think will win?
Litecoin is probably the most stable after ethBut if you really wanna get down to it, the MOST stable coins are the old shitcoins that got pnd and are only worth like 10 satoshi, because their price will never go up again
If those coins ever reach 1 sat, no one will ever buy your bags again and your money is gone forever.
