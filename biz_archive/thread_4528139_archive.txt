Better than fucking Dash.
shit coin
It is, and I expect it to have a higher market cap than Dash by next year.
Dash is a centralized shitcoin with shitty half-assed "features".
Look at Decred's new proposal system:https://blog.decred.org/2017/10/25/Politeia/High quality as fuck.Looking forward to the privacy features in a few months.
It will undoubtedly blow Dash's privacy out of the water (not that that would be difficult).
Trips approves.
I'm staking 2k DCR and it's profitable af.
