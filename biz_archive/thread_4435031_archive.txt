Thinking about doing a 1k to 100k challenge (within a year) through crypto day trading+swing trading Would any of you fuccbois be interested in reading such a thing if I posted updates every few days, or would I hear nothing but "reeeeee get out blogger"?
yes do it, with daily updates
WHATAMGONNADO
Can you make a noob friendly telegram group?
This.
I would love to follow along and potentially make a hundred grand
4435101Same.
wagecuck here so I'll probably put in Â£200 and follow along.
there's a discord server for thathttps://discord.gg/XsdYRt
It would purely be a results thing.
If I end up failing, I don't want to be responsible for making a lot of followers lose money as well
Only if you give me all your money
OP this sounds like a good idea, but you have to be good at writing your story.
Also if you're serious, adopt a tripcode for this challenge only and don't shitpost with it
You'd need proof though, so it doesn't just look like usual shilling.
buy nuls or stay poor
Recon monthly updates would be good to watch
go for it
why not 10k to one million???
Don't have 10kThis challenge is basically a way for me to get out of my poorfag situation while also developing some skills
pls do it
I'm serious, and I'll try keep it as orderly as possible.Some days can be pretty slow, so I'll probably only update once every few days
Start a blog 1kto100k.com
i'm interested
I had a similiar idea just for the fun of itdo it OP
>thinking about it>implying you could
