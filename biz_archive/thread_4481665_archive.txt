yes borderless money that can transfer large amounts of wealth all over the world with negligible fees and without the use of centralized institutions has no real valueIf the value comes from a) being able to transfer quickly and b) having low fees, ETH beats BTC on both counts.
you are so ignorantETH is not a currency it is a platform
it's not a currency it's a platformYet, you can pay with it and it has value.So it's actually both a currency and a platform..Which could be done with any other coin for lower fees and faster tx time
except one major differenceETH has no fixed supply and that's because it costs ETH to modify/add code to the EVM all u own by owning eth is a right to modify the EVM
ETH functions both as a platform and currency
