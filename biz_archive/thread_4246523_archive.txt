Accept it guys.
All coins except bitcoin are done for.
Hasn't anybody noticed that the entire crypto market has gone stagnant except BTC?
You must be new here.
Wait till the BTC bull run changes course, like last May...
Ever heard of a Hard Fork anon?
Didn't think so... see you in a month or so
4246610the fact that bitcoin holds this much influence over alts means the alt market never had a chance.
the alt gains from before were because everyone was excited about crypto, but that phase is over.
nobody cares about anything but bitcoin.you are wasting your time buying anything but bitcoin.
the alt market is dead
whats your purpose in posting something this stupid?im legitimately curiouswe all know there are shitcoins, and then good alts.
nobody cares about anything but bitcoin.this.
there was a brief moment when Bitcoin was shitting the bed with all the infighting and ETH and ripple were surging where there was at least the possibility of BTC getting replacedbut now BTC has cucked the entire alt market so hard that no one even gives a shit about alts regardless of merit.
BTC isn't about smart contracts or efficiency or p2p low costs its about MONEY, storing money, transferring money, making money.
that is all that normies care about, anything else is gay shit that has no impact on the world outside of autists in silicon valley
wtf are you talking about, there are new coins going on moon missions every fucking day.
