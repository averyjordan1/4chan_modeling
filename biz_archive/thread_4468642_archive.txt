doesn't understand how supply and demand works>doesn't understand miners have to sell to cover costskeep gettin rekt cashie
doesn't understand the game being played
lol, ver and jihan's games?
those two are small potatoes.
you don't understand the larger game afoot and it's why you're falling for the conspiracy theories.
enjoy your comfy bags that no one wants
Imagine being this retarded
no my simple friend, the game of mathematics.
the mathematics involved it determining the difficulty of mining BTC, which will lock corecoin into chain death when it adjusts in...four days now
Have you noticed how stable bcash price is?
I think they selling off slowly btc for bch and buttfinex is pumping price with tether.
6 days left... You've been warned...
who still does BTC transactions?
thinking this is about mathtopkek, zoom out bro
But no-one is selling BTC.
average corecuck IQin order to buy, someone has to sell anon
he doesn't understand prices rise because there are more buyers than sellersjeez!
doesn't understand price rises because 30m tethers just moved yesterdayback to plebbit corefag
4469570>surrounded by core brainletsminers are mining BTC at a loss to fool corecucks into thinking everything is fine so they can stealthily dump on you bagholders.
they will finish dumping their corecoin by the time the difficulty adjusts higher in a few days, and then it's game over
BCH adjusts downward over 144 blocks but adjusts up over one block.
If the miners flock to it, it becomes much more unprofitable to mine.
They aren't mining at a loss when you take that into account.
However they will be if they do what you think they will.
All we have to do is watch.
Every other time BCH shills have been in here saying "it's the flippening" they've been wrong before.
It's a pattern of behaviour.
It's a cult.
