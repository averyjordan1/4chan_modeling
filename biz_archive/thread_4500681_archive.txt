WHY DO I HAVE TO BE POORWITH THE PERCENTAGES I EARN, I COULD BE USING LAMBOS AS TOILET PAPER
started with .300 got it to 1.7 now settling in at 1.3 and thats only with some long holds working out rn, i had no idea what i was doing, the more you learn/earn the more you over analyze your decisions too.
Me too.
I only put 100 in power early on cause im in college and cant find a job in shitty bakersfield.
REEEEEEEEEEEE.
sucks to be poor
getting lucky with a shitcoin once>not being a shrimpif you were rich you've lost all your money on confido or some other scam
I started with $200it's gonna take me a 50x just to get to 10k
it's gonna take you 1 wrong shitcoin to go back to 200$
I don't hold long enough to get just'd that big, nor do I fall for the shit biz constantly spams
