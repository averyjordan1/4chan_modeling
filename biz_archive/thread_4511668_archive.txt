Don't say I didn't warn you>In December 2017, Astronaut will be releasing a web and iOS version of its portfolio tracker for token holders to take advantage of.>The portal itself is the communication hub for research, trade execution, updates, investment management and dividends.>While Astronaut has already begun laying the foundation of code for this development, we are actively getting token holders (and prospective token holders) involved to help with UI/UX modifications and requests.
whats your point
So when should I buy?
