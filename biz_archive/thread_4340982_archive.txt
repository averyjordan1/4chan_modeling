Quick question to all the fellow linkies here, where do you store what you have?
I've been reading about some ether wallets being used for it since its erc20 but it sounds a bit sketchy and I don't wanna lose what I have.
Appreciate any info
Ledger nano s.Ultra comfyness achieved
Nano ledger or a hardware wallet of the likes.
If you are a poorfag and don't want an hardware wallet I urge you to use only this :Metamask + myetherwalletThere's some fake myetherwallet website but metamask will protect you from them.
Also backup metamask private key on paper
myetherwallet.com with the chrome extension
