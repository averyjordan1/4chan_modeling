EVER SINCE I CAME TO BIZ I AM LEFT IN FINANCIAL RUINS!
I literally stopped making any money after I started lurking /biz.
Didn't really lose anything either, but before hearing "the latest shit" on 4chan and following purely my own strategy I had nice gains.
Maybe it is the market situation as well, but there is literally zero quality information here.
