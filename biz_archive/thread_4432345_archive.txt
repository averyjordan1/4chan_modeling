Which is the higher-risk, higher-reward investment?Bitcoin or Etherium?Go.
eth lower risk for sure, price barely fluctuates and has held 400 cad for a longgg time
Why do you even need to ask this?

biggest risk and reward right now is BCH
eth lower risk for sure
What kind of shitty altcoin is cad?
I've never heard of it and i've been in crypto for years.

Just hold it as if you were buying Bitcoin that was 3 months old.
I hope you're kidding man
canadian dollars you fuckwit
cadYouâ€™ve got bigger problems
neitherBTC - biggest rewardETH - biggest risk
