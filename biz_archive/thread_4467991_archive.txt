I bet the JOOS did this.
Someone give me a quick rundown on this whole thing.
I need a basic gestalt.
comfydo was shilled hard a few weeks ago due to the low ico price, 10x'd which made a lot of people money however the whole thing was a scam anyway, a lot of people FOMO'd in, then the team announced yesterday they were having "legal issues", day before that huge selloff because duh the team exited and sold all their shit.
Today they deleted EVERYTHING, website, social media etc.
And a new term was invented.
JOOSTED.
Will turn into "Jewsted" in a few days when /pol/ hears.
