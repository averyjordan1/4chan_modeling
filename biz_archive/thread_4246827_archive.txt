/biz rule When you see a coin being shilled in 2 posts.
It's a buy.But when you see it being shilled in 4 posts, SELL!!!!!!!!!
>There are people who bought high instead of accepting they didn't participate in the ICOFOMO is a funny thing.
Are confido niggers getting btfo?
This marks the 6th time in a row ive bought the literal top of something holy shit fucking kill me

>P&DFUUUUUCKKKKKKKKKK
How the fuck do I buy this piece op shit?
You think these losers would have realized this after the ebet pump and dump.
Well, I tried to warn everybody that """"maybe""" it is not the best idea to buy into something that did x15 in 2 days.
But the severe case of FOMO was too strong.
looking at multipliers instead of marketcapyou honestly still donâ€™t understand why this coin is pumping
What are you talking about?
Its still well over 10x ico price
It's just that a lot of the ICO investors have finally made big money from one trade and are desperate to get out while they're still 15x up.
It honestly will probably go at least 3x from here in the next month or two if the ICO investors keep funneling out at this rate
Yeah, everybody gets rich over night.
This delusions.
I definitely wouldn't buy in now, the time to buy in was either at ICO or for 2-3x ICO when it first hit ED.I'm honestly so glad I bought at ICO, I've already sold 3800 tokens for just over 7 ETH.
I'm happy wherever this coin goes from here since I've made back 3.5x my initial investment already.
sold at 16x, good luck with your bags
