Look how the computer industry grew.
Good product => exponential growth.
And the good thing is BTC (representing crypto) is the most undervalued asset yet.
You guys think we are too late on this crypto thing ?
Look in your lives how much clueless normies are.
Even if you enter now you are still early dont worry we will all gonna make it.
Just pick your coin and hold.Now im going to sell my shit : POWR.
Look how pro the team is and look how good they are at finding deals etc.
I will not lie im all in on POWR since Monday.
So far so good.
Hold until q4 2018.I would not pick BTC for long term coz it has big problems, including scalability, centralization and no real anonymity.Consider that the first part of my comment is not cancelled because i tell you in which coin i believe in the second part.
