WHY ARE MY ALTS BLEEDING OUT???
?WHERE IS THE ALL THE MONEY GOING???
?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
were about to enter a long, long bear martket my friend.
brace youself.
Everyone is selling and buying bch, just wait.
They will come back.
Buying BCH.
Once BCH crashes, money will flow back.
BCH is literally the enemy of every other coin including bitcoin.
your money never existed
Dumb money is chasing BCH.
If BCH does collapse at this point I think we could be seeing a long bear market.
Also, keep an eye out for the bitconnect exit!
They're haemorrhaging money right now
it's going into IOTA you retard look at coin market cap
Gee bro I don't know I wonder what recent event could do such a thing
 Is Ada a good safe haven?
