It's not too late to get in on the real pump of the day.
20k bagholder here.
This shit ain't going anywhere.> bought at .07 cents> should've sold at ATH in augustUnless someone can convince me why it's going to pump I'm just going to hold on to these bags until memefactory and dump them no matter what
Hang in there guy.
Thinks look bright.
I don't know shit about TA triangles, but those lines make me money so I'm going to believe this is what's going to happen.
the team itself they have no interest in marketing their coins.
I doubt we will see above 10 cents because the company itself (which is great) doesnt give a shit about their coins
Yeah, I really like the project/team but when I saw the slack message from the dev or whatever basically saying "fuck the price" I knew I wasn't going to make any insane profits.Holding out for memefactory though, hoping that'll be enough to pump it for me to break even at least.
*Devs raised over $13 mil, so have a long runway*Money locked up so they won't run off with it for a few years*Ex-Coinbase team so will probably get listed on Coinbase next year*Lots of industry connections and partnerships in SF*Runs Ethlance which is popular in hiring*Last coin to raise millions.
All new coins won't raise that much, so are at a disadvantage.
*Got listed on Bittrex legally and not considered a security, which is important because it's a voting platform where you can possibly get dividends through Aragon down the road*Price already bottomed out, so technically it's a good time to buy
