Why do people get so frenzied with bitcoin?
I'm sat watching the charts and see it gets pushed back down and then everyone piles in again.
It feels like people trying to get in an overcrowded train.
It was literally $5600-6400 for days but NOW they just have to get in?
are you a newfag?
you think people was just looking at charts when 5600-6400?there is constant buy/sell battle going on.
Price goes up when number of $ buy > number of $ sell
