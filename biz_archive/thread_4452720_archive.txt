>HE BOUGHT BITCOINFTFY
he didnt buy bitcoin
I bought BTC at ATH on many occasions, right up from less than $5 to where we are today.
U got a problem with that, bro?
why not there's a new ath every few days
You've been buying bitcoin for this long and you still buy in at highs?
But why?
I always buy relatively small amounts.
Low risk.
High return.
Wew lads what is even going on with this thing?
If you bought bitcoin at literal every ATH you'd be a billionaire now
Wew lads what is even going on with this thing?pumpmachine ran out of tethers
You mean low return.
Short downtrend, doesn't yet overpower the long term uptrend.
