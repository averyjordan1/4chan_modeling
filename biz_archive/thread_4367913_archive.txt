How does trading these low volume micro coins work?
I'm thinking setting aside a percentage of my portfolio just to trade shitcoins on etherdelta.
I have worries though, are the volumes big enough for me to get in and out of my positions in time?Experienced etherdelta traders tips pls

well if it pumps, then there will be volume, and you can get out.
