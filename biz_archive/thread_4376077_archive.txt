4377603He seems very calm for someone who just lost 70btc.
He's either in shock or lying.
I think this is an elaborate stunt to gather donations/marketing/referrals/avoiding blame when the scam inevitably comes crashing down
Jumped off the STEAM bandwagon.
Lmao
tbqh there are good reasons for keeping your coins in a hot wallet on an exchange
Could be a larp but he's really bad at OPSEC if he's been hacked before for $1400 and didn't change his behavior.
Also really nice of him to talk about tax evasion on his channel for the IRS to watch.
Sure hope he's reporting those hotel rooms he pays for in Bitcoin!!
