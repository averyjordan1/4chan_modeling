I'm for the most part retarded about this.
Is there a way I could give someone my initial investment and they take a percentage of what they've raised the amount to.
I feel like I'm being stupid and doing everything wrong.
I want extra money to pay off bills, so quick returns are great.
Would 10% of the total be a good share?If you're good, you would make a pretty big 10%, right?
