NOBODY IS GIVING YOU FREE COINS YOU STINKY BEGGAR
Because people who are nice usually have something to hide, like how evil they actually are.
4chan gives it to you straight and true, because they know you can handle it.People who pretend to be good have evil intentions, perhaps ones they're unaware of themselves because they are blind to their actions.Also, stop being a faggot.
implying /biz/ is not full of Jews who will talk you into buying their bags
fuck you
piss off niglet
Nvm, I was wrong & I'm not asking for COINS, I'm asking for a little help because I'm like stressed af school, work etc etc.
And you people should stop offending without knowing MY story but yeah whatever, I'm expecting more of you offending me tho
