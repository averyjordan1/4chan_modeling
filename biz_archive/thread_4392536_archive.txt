Wich do you enjoy more?>Bch bleedingOr>Btc tankingI d say fiddy fiddy.
Told people to get out of bch so many times before dump but was called nasty names for that tip.
Now those infidels are paying the price and i like to watch them suffer.
Hard choice.
I really dislike BTC with its wild swings and retarded endlessly ongoing nonstop rallies/drops and hardforks, but I genuinely hate BCH and their retarded cucklet followers even more.
I feast upon their tears and thrive in seeing them in pain and losing humongous amounts of their money for supporting a band of criminal war thugs and failing their takeover attempt.
Either way, I am 50% BTC and 50% alts now.
As long as BCH keeps losing, I win and every other BTC supporter as well.
I am 75btc 25alts.
Cashtards crying is my favourite music.
I have enough money already so watching idiots suffer gives me more jo.
I change my statement to 65bch bleeding 35btc gaining.I almost couldnt handle myself after the dump.
Rushed here on /biz/ to see all those pinkwojaks.
Still days after dump there is alot of pink wojaks to laugh at!Thanks biz
neither.being emotional about coins is a sure path to poverty.
