Is SUB gonna pop off or is it too late?
It's not too late.
Product release in December.
I think this is still a good buy in long term, but if you pick it up today don't be surprised if it goes red on you in the short term.
It is up nearly 30%.Of course that doesn't necesarilly mean shit in crypto and it could keep mooning to 300%.
Make a judgement call I guess.
Although I recommend waiting.
Nobody knows how next few days will be for bitcoin and if it falls so will alts.
I almost FOMO'd into this today, and it's a good thing CoinBase and my SHIT bank takes 2 weeks to process, because I think is right and it's going to drop.
It's my first time hearing about this and it's only being posted occasionally here and reddit.
I'm buying in before end of month if the charts looking good.
Totally love this project.
Actually after this post, I think I'm gonna FOMO in and sit in the red.
I'd rather sit in the red for two months than wish I had bought when it was cheap.
Especially with all this net neutrality shit going on and comcast being douches, the political climate is ripe
Thanks guys.
More looking for a flip so I think Iâ€™ll sit this one out.
