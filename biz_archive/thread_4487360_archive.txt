>he's not accumulating EBET before the alpha launchyou might not have much longer..get into a 10x coin that will have a working and in-demand product.No one wants LINK anymore, it won't have that for a year.
These ebet bags are getting heavy.
Got in on the first five minutes of ebet ico because I thought it was going to sell out quickly.
it easily could have desu, i dont think it's doing too badly, it just doesnt have enough hype for whatever reason
who /more than 10K EBET here/
when is it actually going to be released?pretty sure they said a few more weeks but it's at least nice to have low buy orders for when brainlets dump
Fuck the hype, accumulate brother.
This will moon once we have a working product.
Public alpha is coming soon.High risk / High reward
Holding 15k from ICO and been accumulating for cheap on ED
blockchain betting memegambling is for brainlets and brainlets can't navigate crypto
etheroll is worth like 20-30M, if this can just get to 10 instead then it's a 10-20xyou dont have to gamble directly on it yourself senpai
Reminder, EBET was literally created to shill against LINK and is therefore SATAN .Reminder buy as much LINK as you possibly can before you can't afford one link token.
LINKenjoy your /biz/ shillcoin
bought 1K of this awhile ago.
really love the idea so i'll be happy to see if it works out well
Wait I thought they killed this and made a new ethbet token.
if you mean ETHERBET or whatever the fuck that was, just some idiot collecting /biz/ addresses, the project isnt even real
That random etherbet airdrop going around /biz/ right now has nothing to do with EthBet
4488097desu everything on /biz/ that asks for an address for free shit is a scam/biz/ users are fucking retared to keep responding to them, half of them are an obvious joke or lie anyway
