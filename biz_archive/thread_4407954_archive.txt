I am starting up my drone photography and videography business soon but as far as I can see the only issue I have left is getting the laptop to edit videos and I work a fulltime job but I use all that money to pay debts off for medical and others.
So I'm trying to sell stuff on Facebook Craigslist and others including a ebike kit n battery for the laptop but I of el like no one crew enough to help my business or anything and I can't take loans out because I'm paying back the other loans from my fulltime job.....what should I do???
Maybe you should consider not starting a business?
try cryptos
I've wanted to open my own for a while and this is something I love while in sure I can't make a ton of money I would like to keep going
What is that
/p/fag here, what kind of photo business?
Do you even know what kind you're aiming for?- pay off all your loans first- highly likely your business is going to fail, especially when this directionless- stop fucking around, go get clients and get work in- great photos are secondary, build connections- learn to edit- real money is in prints- get ready to work grueling hours
one of my friends does this, not sure if he makes much from it though
One man can't do it allYou need a video editor, make arrangements.
one man can't do all, but all men can do your mom :)
I do know what im aiming for and i am paying off the debts but it will take a long time to pay them all off.
And i got 1 client and he does spread word around so far and i do know how to edit videos and photos
