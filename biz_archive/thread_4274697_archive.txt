When will the link shill in /biz die out.
/biz Madre me v√§te this scam shitcoin.And stop with all the beggers.
Darwin want to see you die.
Then filter the LINK threads you fucking loser.
It's not a scam and it's not a shitcoin, and people are excited because it has probably the greatest growth potential of any token.I get it that the constant threads are annoying, but /biz/ is allowed to get excited about rare opportunities like this.
Do your future self a favor and throw a few bucks at it.
This is the next big opportunity after BTC and ETH.
