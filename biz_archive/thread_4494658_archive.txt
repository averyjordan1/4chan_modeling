Fuck Bitfinex.
They have already kicked off all Americans, and we Anglo Americans rule the world.
If you are reading this and are not Anglo-American, we have already defeated you in one, and most probably two wars.
Probably four if you count the British Master Race, who founded the United States btw.
Please know that Bitfinex is not in the Anglosphere and is thus a minor footnote in the history of actual humans.
Fucking FUD...Bitfinex is huge and profit from fees alone is huge every day..
They have more than enough money to fund tether 1:1.
