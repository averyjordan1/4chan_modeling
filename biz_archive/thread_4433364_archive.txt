>Anna is ready to help you>CrystalYou've ching chonged me for the last time.
Say it in code
Haahahahahha
try it yourself, log in on alibaba and ask.
They don't all give the same answer though, some say no.
I'm not saying this is true though, I mean "Crystal" said yes but they're not accepting it yet so doesn't make any sense.
Most likely Crystal doesn't even know what neo is
Lol, this sounds like an answer from some bored teenager behind helpdesk who don't know what you are talking about and don't care.
fuck your big mother if you want true fuck
Anna is alibaba's bot.
After you speak to ana you can ask for a real person.
In this case it was Crystal.
Try it yourself
