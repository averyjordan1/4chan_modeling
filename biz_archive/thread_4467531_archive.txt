How do I trick people into giving me their money for free, like a Casino?
Kneepads.
anything where they think they have a chance to win more.
greed overwhelms logic
How?
Everyone knows you can't win at Las Vegas, but they still go.
why not a casino tho
invest in casino stocks
I gamble or bet with small amounts just for the fun of it, I treat it as a money spent for entertainment and certainly don't hope to get it back in the long run.
Create something as fun as gambling and I'll be giving that money to you.
I've never been there
As he said: greed overwhelms logic.
tricks, scams, consyou hear stories about fake irs agents sucking retirement money from old people
Run an ICO!
You can go to the cayman islands with the money.
Don't keep your investors updated and NEVER apply for exchanges
Perfect example of a brainlet who's NEVER gonna make it.
Yes that's what he said retard
Make your own casino?Try amusement park or county fair games.
I've seen families spend over $100 to win a big stuffed animal.
