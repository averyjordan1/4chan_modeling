I tried that with chancoin and there just isn't enough volume or enough buy orders
You do it slowly
market order
Look, we have a whale here.
Just sell it slowly, I used to own like 3% of a shitcoin once and was a fool and sold it all once it hit polo for 10 grand.
If i'd held I'd made 200 grand.
Even now 2 years later there is more than enough volume to sell a Bitcoin a day and not disturb the market.
Even the shittiest coins manage to resiliently maintain enough buy support and volume.
Depends How shit of a shitcoin we talking here?
Normally working with 10-30MM Marketcap coins.
But after I hit $100k, I realized I can't always do these "all-in" moves.
I could be reckless and brash with a smaller stack and not effect the market, but its not the case anymore.
$100k is not a whale
are you retarded?he said $100k worth of a shitcoin.Certainly that's more worth than some shitcoins in the market already
What's the daily volume like?You could probably buy like 5-10% daily market per day without moving the price too much, if volume starts increasing though expect wild fluctuations.
