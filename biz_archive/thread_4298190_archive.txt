A proper Dubai gemExisting company (Royal Kingdom Enterprises)Creators of Palmex for DBIX, exchange just opened upPartnered with Arabian Chain and others under NDA agreementsToken supply, get this, 15 million!Already x5 from ICOToken holders receive profits from all the ventures the company invests in, so far we know of 20% from all fees from recently opened Palmex, imagine what's to come from other partnerships they venture intowith the news of the arrests of all the saudi arabian princes, they are probably looking to move funds to escape any asset freeze
Already x5 from ICOBUY HIGH, SELL LOW
yeah no thanks, ill stick with EPY14 cents with 15 million total supplygonna ride that 5-10x on that one instead, good luck tho!
True.
FOMO to begin 2018 when first dividends are paid out.
Arabian TaaS for sure, but richer.
DBIX supply to increase yearly.
Thatâ€™s the currency for ArabianChain, custom ETH fork I believeRKC is coin for company Royal Kingdom Enterprises.
Actual company that invests and creates projects and shares profits with coin holders from said projects.First lot to be paid out start of 2018.
Will blow up then.
