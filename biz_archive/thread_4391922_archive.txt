"But muh paradigm, muh death spiral, muh satoshi's vision".
No anon, you're just stupid.
Bitcoin classic, bitcoin unlimited, and now bitcoin cash; they all failed.
Now take your bags and leave, hope that taught you a lesson this time around.
It's a fucking PND group what the fuck are you expecting?
It's solarcoin dumbasses SLR
People think it's POWR.
It's not.
The coin wasn't even out yet when teeka gave his tip about it and they basically confirmed in the POWR slack it wasn't them.
Volume for SLR shot up from almost nothing to over 4 mil on October 21st before any word of this leaked out.
That's teeka and his buddies filling their bags.
You guys are idiots for real.
Stay poor.
Why do people give a shit about what a bald whale claims is good?
So what?
Anyone can just write a report about a coin every month and why it's a long hold.
Ever since September afaik this faggot's been a hot topic all over the place and thanks to him his shitty tips are going to be manipulating the market for no good reason.
Is the audit today?
the report*
