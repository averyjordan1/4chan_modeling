47k sats and chart still looks in tact...why are whales pushing this down?
because it's overpriced and isn't going to grow until bitcoin break 11k
Its a pump and dump coin just keep around 2%-5% and sell when it rockets
These bags are heavy anon.Shitcoins like bytecoin who don't have an active dev team have a higher market cap.
halving on December 11th will help it come back
WHALES SPOTTED.
THEY HAVE HEARD MY CRIES.WE ARE GOING UP
