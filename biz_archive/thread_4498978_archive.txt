Ignoring all of the bitshilling threads, can we have a good old decent reseller thread?
Any good Black friday/Cyber monday deals you're gonna get into for reselling?
Personally Im gonna be buying up PS4 1TB bundles and harvesting the hard drives to sell for 90-100 while selling the console for 150, the controlle for 40 and the games that come with it for 30-50 depending on how much they're worth.
I can pretty much make 100 off each PS4 bundle so Im gonna be spending on 10-20 PS4s and see if I get bites.
I'm going to buy sex from a prostitute and then resell my used condom to your mother to use like a go-gurt
