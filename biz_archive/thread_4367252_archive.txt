Looking to trade 15 years of my life 12 hours a day of slave labor for 10 bitcoin upfront.
Will make legal contract with loanee.
I lost everything because of impatience and this is my only hope to actually bounce back.
Willing to risk my life for this and can't wait around for a job.
Anyone interested?
I'm a perfectly fit 20 y/o male discord is ebst.

I lost everything because of impatienceYou're not the kind able to work efficiently.Your offer is worth nothing.
I'm not buying the workforce of someone who doesn't have any.
.5 bitcoin then
And btw slavery in the US is only legal if decided by a judge, after a crime.And outside the US slavery is abolished, so we couldn't even enforce this contract.
nice scam op>make "legal" contract>take bitcoins and tell loanee to fuck off>oops looks like the contract can't be enforced because slavery isn't legal in the first place>thanks for the free btc sucker!>nuthin personel kid
I need a slave to worship me wherever I go.
cant afford you thoughAre you even capable of doing 10 pushups?
As many of you now know, I am INTEL, and retired OPTEL.
Took me two seconds to get inside OP's head.A) He does well with the loan ----> transfers it to offshore acct.
= You're fuckedB) He does poorly ----> An Hero's = Your fucked.Lose / Lose.May make an isolated wallet for tips just for funsies for my observations and inside INTEL.
