TA isn't looking too good.
Any good developments coming up ?
Yes.
A lot.
Seriously, watch the interview with the CEO on youtube, about 40 minutes long (someone pls provide link).TA is pretty horrendous but it's a great buying opportunity for after the fork/end of 2017 and start of 2018.
TA doesnt mean shit during a bitcoin fork.Watch Eric Gu's interview.2 new exchanges added today (chinese exchanges)new partnerships every other day.ETP will be a big deal very soon.
using TA in crypto
don't be deluded, this did x10 from the 4. sep bottom in a matter of days, had a severe correction to x6 and will not pull another big increase soon.
it is waiting time now
nah
