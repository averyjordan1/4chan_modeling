So my wife met someone else.
Long story short I was kicked out of my house, she is a bartender who makes twice as much as me yet lied about that so I would have to pay 40% of my income in child support.
She also filed taxes separately the last few years claiming the kids leaving me with huge irs issues.
I'm staying in a climate controlled storage unit for now.
Need to get out of this hole.
Any advice?
I have a good idea that could be the next big internet/social media thing but don't have the money to put tech development behind it.
I am not shit talking it does have potential to be big.

Sorry.

bartender who makes twice as much as mewow you must be a failure if your making half as much as a bartender.
Women dont want to date lazy NEETs , get a job.
Hey guys.
I recently cucked my hubby and make him pay 40% in child support.
The thing is I heard he has a good idea for an app and want to make sure I own 51% of the company.
Any advice?
