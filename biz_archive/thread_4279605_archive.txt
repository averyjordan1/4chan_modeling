did you guys watch the video on the home page of RCN?
https://ripiocredit.network/ And did you know they already have a huge network to introduce this to?
This is like OMG-Omise level advantage.
Great use case, needs the coin.
Its like their own peer to peer ripple network with millions of users.
I'm in love.
Tim Draper has also invested in them.
He also just invested in Metaverse ETP.
Usually when billionaires are doing something you can't join.
With crypto you can.
Let that settle in.
https://ripiocredit.network/index.html#investorsProve me wrong or get in!
All they have is white paper.
And Tim draper who is waiting to dump his stack again
do yourself a favor and do some light research before you post retarded lies.
this is your opportunity to make money at a very early stage in this project.
go read you FUCK.
this is FINTECH at it's finest
4279611Guys, they have an existing business (https://www.ripio.com/en/) and customers to easily sell this to.
Thats huge for adoption.
Thats why OMG is what it is.
Do you deny this?The ICO pre-sale had NO BONUSES.
Do some googling please.
But even if there were, what does Tim Draper have to gain from making 10% on 10 Million?
When you're in the billions you're only concerned with making 100s of millions.
Thats why they invest in ICO and HOLD.
Maybe he'll dump some when its 3-400M market cap, probably not till its nearing a billion (est.
Q1 2019) or more.
Its a little pumped right now but may not go much lower.
Long term it won't matter.
I thinkt he fact that there is already a prexisting market is huge, I'm aiming for another dip at 1600 sats to get some more but desu I dont mind buying anything under 2k sats, this is a long term hold, I just need to hope it doesnt pump before I can invest 2 weeks worth of daily max deposits
