Someone on Ethtrader said Ethereum is going 10x from NOV '17 to NOV '18 landing somewhere around $3k EOY.
Someone with vested interest in a coin rising in value says that coin is going to rise in value
Someone on Ethtraderkys
hope it will, eventhough it won't happen
My friend's father works at ethereum says between 15:05 and 16:09 it's going to have the biggest pump ever Screencap this and check didgets
It won't be that much but I expect to test new ATH pretty soon, end of the year projection is between 450-500 dollars due to Proof of Stake
I say this on every ETH thread and I will until it's not true:ETHEREUM WILL NOT MOON ANY TIME SOON, NOT AS LONG AS WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF ICO'S SLOWLY SELLING OFF THEIR BAGS EVERY TIME THE PRICE GOES UP.
Some people on 4chan said your mom does anal for some change, so what?
