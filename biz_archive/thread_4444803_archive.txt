how much do I need to invest in this to see decent returns?
and when?and please don't just post photos of those weird ugly plastic men.
weird>plastic>"kill him"The volume is low at the moment, but this could change really quick due to the new ICO listings they announced.
Also it is going sideways for weeks now, so i think it will not go any cheaper and has really low market cap right now anyway.Because of low volume the payout isnt much right now but competitors like kucoin were over 1$ already so there is a high chance for a moon mission as well.
