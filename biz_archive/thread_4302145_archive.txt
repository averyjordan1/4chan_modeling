Zap.store
you mean the store where chainlink oracles will be for sale?
No.

On zap you have to make the oracle on there.
It's like App Store.
You can't list an android app on there.
You have to build exactly with their tools.
Zap will make LINK obsolete.

Zapfags (both of them) eternally rekt.
Chain link is not an oracle.
Chain link is a network of decentralized oracles.
Zap isn't even competition.
