The year is 2020.
What is the price?
500 SK8 coins
$7,70
480$
$0 since it's another scamcoin being pumped by tethers on bitfinex, and with devs that have no qualms about making misleading statements.
It's part of the OMG/NEO/IOTA scamcoin trifecta.
negative.
left it all behind.
if its pumped i ride the wave but thats it.
don't trust them.
$56,434
300 OMG required to unlock signature Jun deck in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater X.Pre-order on Amazon for free 50 OMG.
year 2020. apple sticker on hover board.
According to Teeka Tiwari, up to $680 per token.Unfortunately he only recommends buying it up to $6, so if one token costs $6.01 or more, it's not worth it.
All trades and commerce will be done with OMG.I will own 4 different mansions and masterbate all day.
So.... you guys are saying its worth holding for 3 years?
.20 - 8.00 just like it has been forever, what a scam coin.
