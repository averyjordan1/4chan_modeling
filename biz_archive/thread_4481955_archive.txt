Did some bizlets actually buy this?
If you're stupid you bought it.
Obvious scam from day one and my IQ is one of the highest.
Some people genuinely lost upwards of 100k.
I never even bothered checking what it does after looking at the website and the team....
Nah.
But I did see some fairly reliable guys on Twitter shilling it for it's future 2x gain potential etc (despite already massive pump).
Tbf to them they don't pretend to do anything other than shill prospects for quick gains and say nothing of team quality/longterm prospects.
Legit lost 1k on thisOh well, my bad I guess
why isnt the cap at $0?
Literally CON in the name
Wah!
The market cap isnt going up fast enough!>I know.
ill just put it into wallet, and not look at crypto for a whole year.
months later>haha, i bet confido is $100 now, and im in lamboland.>buuuut, ill just wait out the remaining 6 months so im richer
I'm sure that the people that invested in this stuck to the golden rule and only invested what they where willing to lose, so no harm done.
I like you
I wish I would have bought early and dumped at the top.
Looks like the pump was quite nice.Overall glad I never touched this tho
