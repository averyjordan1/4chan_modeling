Biz, you can make a SHIT TON of money buying and selling BITCOIN CASH.Remember, Roger Ver and his crew use BITHUMB aka the KOREAN exchange to pump the coin.Thus, you can simply observe what is happening with BCH on Bithumb and compare it to the other exchanges (leading indicator).Then, you can trade on Bittrex and be quite confident.For example, right now, the BCH price on Bithumb is $1744 compared to Bittrex at $1661.So, obviously you can just hold your BCH and wait.
When the Bithumb price intersects the Bittrex price as it falls, it's time to sell!Seriously, make some fucking money while you can all thanks to the Bitcoin Cash crew.
