HST will be listed on livecoin tomorrow (22 Nov).Currently it's listed on ED and kucoin.
Crytopia will list HST before the end of this month (date is not disclosed).
Binance and bittrex coming soon before EOY.>Working product and real life usageThe team will announce their partnerships in December.
Could be the Australian govt or NGOs -- they presented HST to the United Nations in New York.>Very undervaluedMarket cap below $6m which is crazily low for a project with giant potential like this.>Good investmentThis coin fits to be a long term hold (6-12 months) for those of you who are not in the flipping game.As always, do your own research.
longtermso no immediate gains?maybe December
Who is the team?
After Confido I want to be crystal clear who the fuck is responsible for this project
Holding those $0.25 bags
https://horizonstate.com/team/Seems fairly solid
As we both know, the crypto market is uncertain.
I will not say "Hey buy this and you will get x3 gain by next month" because I truly don't know what's gonna happen.But considering the quality of the team and their product which has already been used, I can say that I'm optimistic HST can hit minimum $1 by EOY (this is my personal opinion).Of course you'll ask that, after the confido disaster.
You can check the team on their website horizonstate.com and do join the telegram t.me/horizonstate they are very active and helpful in the telegram.I also bought high at 0.0008 ETH which I thought was the floor (it once hit 0.0012 ETH).
But we're in good hands, anon.
This isn't some random useless shitcoin.
As soon as they announce the partnerships and binance, our patience will be rewarded.
mike is that u?
Thats not Mike Carlo.... Im MIKE
Prost, anon!
