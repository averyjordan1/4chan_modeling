Could this be financially stable?
What I mean is, paying monthly for said service and a deductable whenever you have to do major repair work.
Ex.
Transmission going out, blowing a gasket or whatever exceeds 1000 or something
Good luck getting paid out.
It exists and nobody buys it.
People lease cars instead.
Also ur premiums wpud have to be high because only people with failing vehicles would even consider this.
