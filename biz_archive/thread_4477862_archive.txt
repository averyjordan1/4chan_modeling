I decided to get money out at $8180 so that I don't go to sleep with crypto.
Seems it was a good idea.Who can tell me why the current drop?
Correction?
Tether scam is beginning to unravel.
Some of the highest volume exchange rely on Tether solely to trade between cyrpto pairs.It's a legit disaster.
I moved out of Kraken onto Bitfinex recently.
I have $327 which in my poor country is a fortune.
Is that US dollars or Tethers?
What do I do?
Buy at dip then send back to Kraken and exchange for euros?
Kraken lists actual USD and also USDT.I never held USDT, writing was on the wall since inception.
