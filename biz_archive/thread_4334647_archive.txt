Whats a good site that lets you sort recent BTC trades by the decreasing volume (so largest volume trades show at the top)?
I used to use Kraken for this, but lately Kraken won't fucking load at all.
Shit site, feel sorry for anyone who is trying to trade on it.
NOOO I NEED TO GRT OUR OF BCH KRAKEN NOT WORKINF
That's too bad....Anyone know a site for this?
I find that sorting by volume lets you see what the whales are trading and thats the best way to inform if you should be buying or selling coins.
If whales are selling, you should sell.
If whales are buying in large amounts, they know something and its time to buy.
You can do this on Kraken, but their site fucking sucks so I need a new site to do this.
do you mean like looking for walls on the depth chart?
I think this thread just lowered my IQ
Not a graph chart.
Just like numbers:Column 1: BTC traded; Column 2: Buy or SellI just want to see the number of BTC traded in the past hour, then sort these 2 columns by volume to see what the largest volume transactions were in the past hour.I've profited from this data when I had access to it, but I can't get on Kraken now.
Its really strange.
I can't find ANY site that lets you sort the order book like this other than Kraken....its like ((((THEY)))) don't want you to see the data sorted this way.
Op here.
NVM.
You don't have to log into kraken to access this:https://www.kraken.com/chartsSo if you sort by volume, of the last 250 trades, about 50/50 of the top volume trades are buy/sell.
To me, that says total uncertainty.
If the top 25 high volume trades are all saying buy, then buy.
If they all say sell, then sell.
You'll do pretty good if you set stop/loss orders and wait until you see the top volume trades all being buys.
Holy shit those perfect titties
