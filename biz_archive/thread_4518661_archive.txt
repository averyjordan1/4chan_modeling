When Link is tanking:Fomo:>this doesnt make sense.
Chain Link has all these major partnerships and is the first major coin in this niche to have this much progress.Fudders:>THE CRYPTO MARKET IS UNPREDICTABLE!
INVESTORS WANT THEIR DEVELOPERS TO HYPE THEIR COIN LIKE OMG AND NEO!
DELUDED LINKIES!
THE MARKET DOESNT CARE ABOUT WHAT MAJOR PARTNERSHIPS OR TECH LINK HAS!
THE MARKET ONLY LIKES SHITCOINS BECAUSE THE MARKET IS JUST SO STUPID AND UNPREDICTABLE!When Link is rising:Fomo:>See?
The fundamentals i talked about are starting to kick in?
Link is completely undervalued now.Fudders:>WHAT?
THIS MAKES NO SENSE!
I PREDICTED LINK SHOULD BE DOWN!
THEIR MAIN NET ISNT OUT YET!
WHY IS IT RISING?
THEIR TECH DOES NOT MAKE SENSE AT ALL!
AND THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WERE ALL FAKE!
IT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE MARKET!
LINK HAS NO MAIN NET YET!
