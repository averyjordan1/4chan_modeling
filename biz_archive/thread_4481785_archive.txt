How can Tether's market cap increase so much yet its price always stay at 1$?
reminder to filter the word tether and 99% of NSA posts on /biz/ will be gone
Pajeet makes a shitcoin and says its value is pegged to $1 at 1:1 ratio, as long as there's equal amount of $ in Pajeet's bank account.Pajeet can now issue new coins that has the same value as long as people believe that it has that value backing it up.Just like the Federal Reserve.
