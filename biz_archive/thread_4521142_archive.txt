There is no question these two are shit coins.
The difference between these two and others are the these two get pumped on a regular basis.Main reasons to buy RDD now: sat bottom, meaning it goes up from here>Redd-ID (aka meme-id) is still in the works and giving holders hope for gainsMain reasons to buy XVG now:>sub 70 sats atm, with it's usual stale point being 100 sats>army of people willing to shill it>good for tricking people into thinking it's the next Monero or even betterMake some gains off of the current lows and have the long-term holders pay for it.
Bought RDD when it was at 15 last time and sold it at 60 sats.
Profits were okay, so I might buy some again soon.
>too soon
