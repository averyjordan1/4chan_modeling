NAV is going to be the Vertcoin of 2018.
Why aren't you in?
anonymous dapps :)
It's going to be dope.
I just wish it wasn't such a cock tease.
Everytime I enter a position it pumps 1k sats and dumps 2-3k.
It needs another run like it has when it went from 13k to 30k.
VTC will be the new LTC, NAV will be the new VTC, REQ will be the new NAV, TNT will be the new REQ
So no GPU, CPU, or ASIC mining... how tf do you mine it then?
And there's no max coin limit?
Sounds like a shit coin to me... what am I missing here?
It's proof of stake.
You keep a node open and get 4-5% return per year based on how much you own.
