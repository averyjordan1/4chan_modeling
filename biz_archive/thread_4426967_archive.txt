I hope you bought into BCH for the weekend
I did
dis gonna be good
how high will it go?
Not very
Depends on how much tether Bitfinex creates to pump his own ponzi btc sheme.If they control themselves and dont issue like 300 million dollars (they issued close to that the last 2 weeks) BCC will pump the hell out of it.
Yes, I bought at 870 two days ago and am already 50% up.
Sold at 870 two days ago, just fuck my shit up
It happens dude.
I bought 10 at 246 when it dropped just after the fork in August, and sold at 800 and then watched it go up to fucking 2000 while I was on vacation.
The real pump isn't happening this weekend, it's next weekend.
Agree, the day 25 is the key.
4427829Any legit reason or just the usual bullshit?
Difficult adjustment for BTC.
Alright cheers.
Think it will bleed out over the coming week like it did last week?
Bough all mine sub 0.1 so not too worried.
Stick with NEO pump this weekend.
Next weekend is Bcash, sorry Bitcoin Cash.
