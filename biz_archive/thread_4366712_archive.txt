Biggest scam in crypto history
What do you want to know?
It's a scam, it will crash violently at some point.
If I was you I'd take profits now.Market cap is already quite high, it could certainly keep going up but it could equally drop to oblivion if the dev decides to dump his stash, or if the NEO council publicly points out that they are not affiliated with it (like what happened with Ethereum Dark).
Sell ASAP before there's no buy orders in and you're stuck holding bags of some useless shit.
