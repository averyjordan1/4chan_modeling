EFL just got pumped and is now dumping steadily.
Give it a few days for the price to go lower and the volume to sink as well.
It's gonna get pumped again.
This coin gets fucked around all the time buy the dips at around 2000 sats or lower then set sell order at 3k or 4k sats and wait for another chinese/korean group to steadily pump it
