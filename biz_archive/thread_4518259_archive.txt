BITCOIN OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!
the returns from this event will be unprecedented in human history
You mean BCH over 9000.
Stupid pajeet
Oh god, I'm gonna laugh and then wank when it crashes on you again.
PROTIP: this time it's for good
nah its not happening tonight man its 2 early, the difficulty adjustment is still 2 days awaykoreans are just getting carried away buying too much
Poor pajeet thinking BTC isn't going to 3k this weekend
the graph looks EXTREMELY similiar to how BCH broke out originally.
Started with a 20% pump and jammed upwards near 120% in the following day
>operation dragon dildoes
I'm opening 20x position
yeah i think we ran out of steam for tonight though, 30% in a day is a loti sold and looking to buy back in on the dip ~1400pretty sure this shit is going parabolic this weekend
just hodl it will go up again
desu im not even trading those particular coins just holding what i havebut its fun to watch
I have 80k after selling at 1530.
Getting a 10% swing trade is like $7500 profit for me after fees.
Fingers crossed.
Wrong.
Mining switches on 25th, accumulation/pump for 48 hours before that.
Even without any specific /biz/ fed information, just use your common sense...
