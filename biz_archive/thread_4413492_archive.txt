What are your reasons for owning this alternate ethereum?
Do you think it will do well in the future?
Is it directly in competition with ETH?
IS there room for both?
Does anyone actively buy ETC?
dyor.
It just exists for daytrading and pump and dumps.
Solves the Ethereum Is Too Expensive problem
I'm a developer but I'm too poor to pay for contracts on the ethereum network, so I just develop on the ethereum classic network.Ethereum Classic is better programmed in some regards, sources are smaller and you can do some MAGIC to get your contracts a smaller size for gas fee then you could on the main Ethereum fork.If you're an investor only there is no point unless you know you got floor.
If you want to develop on blockchain in any way, Ethereum Classic is a budget friendly way to deploy contracts.t.

thanks for this info.
but if lots of people start using it to deploy contracts won't it rise in price?
Why would anyone buy a dead shitcoin
ETC is the true ethereum and vitalik is a pedo playing god.
Once he forked because some dun goofed up the dao contract....ETH became a shitcoin to me.
Check out video from their summit in Hong Kong a few days ago.
It’s a real ethereum fork run by adults who had enough of vitalik’s autismal shenanigans long before we even knew about them.
Of course.
But in the mean time its a fraction of the price and faster.
For some reason developers want to stay on the crowded main fork.
Yea - something about the ETC group does seem more "adult" than whatever Vitalik is running.
Less scummy ICOs.
I wonder how high ETC can grow.
Does anyone know if LINK token can operate with ETC?
Yep, I have one just because.
It's gonna moon and make me a trillionaire.
Yes of course, it would take only a line of code to get anything running from ethereum to ethereum classic.
