So lets get the timeline right about what happened the last couple days>BTC has a bull run and is oversold to mid 6K$ in anticipation of the Segwit2x fork>Smart (big) money started moving their BTC to BCH because they had info about what was going to happen>{{{They}}} announced the Fork isn't going to happen>confidence in BTC takes a it>hashpower switches to BCH>Activate_BCH_pump.jpeg>BCH on a very well coordinated pump surpasses BTC trading volume and takes 2nd in top 25 crypto raising to +2,8K$>Dumps to current levels>Succeeded to display how although all crypto claim to be "decentralized" and out of the reach of banks and governments, the current situation is worse because the power to move the market in whatever direction is centralized in the hand of a few peopleThoughts?Have I missed something?

Please refrain from post this king of gibberish
The market is deciding.
Fees and transaction times are unbearable, people need an alternative.
Segwit 2 was going to alleviate that some, but really hardly at all.
Meanwhile people are getting woken up to what a fraud "Off chain solutions" are.
Begin to hedge with BCH.
Segwit 2 is shit canned.
Faith in BCH is reinforced.
Price action and volume go ape shit.
People fomo and move BTC.
Fees and transaction times out the fucking ass, faith lost.
Rinse repeat.Core is fucked.
Just shake shake shake it off and buy b t conly taylor swift could make something so dumb
THIS IS NOT A DRILL148M$ worth for BTC moved to Bitfinex ready to get dumped see https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/14KsG6hxkM3cGGC4DvyEdf8uytoE7x9WRQ and https://blockchain.info/tx/6ba0e3732c71b04a66a739a20f6a4bdbaa8588c6d34d0be0e1bdb2de0c46c376We could experience a flash crash in the near future.Should we all place BTC buy orders are 0,1$ per BTC on bitfinex?
Yes, go ahead.
Good luck with bitcoin cash too.
not much faith on bch either since everyone took profit on it.all bitcoon should die.
That pretty much sums it up but this has been planned for a long time ,it’s a coordinated attack on bitcoin to seize power ,jihan wu was using an exploit to gain 10% additional hashpower and Segway fucked that up ,changing the block size to 2mb isn’t a scaling solution ,you would need like 100mb blocks or more to handle visa levels.
just kill yourself
why don't you
