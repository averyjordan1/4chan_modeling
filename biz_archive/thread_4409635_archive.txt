The hookers that you hire using meme money, do you trust them?
Who's to say they won't tell the world you bought hookers if you become famous as well as rich?
Eh just become someone like Dan Bilzerian who literally gives no shits.
His fans understand who he is and dont care.
He goes on talk shows talking about paying strippers to blow him.
Gives zero shits.
Still is rich and famous.
Pay them good and dont let them use their phone while fucking or sucking ur dick and only use escort to come to your house
Who gives a shit dude?
If people find out, you tell them how good it was
My 40 year old self when I settle down and have a family does.
Also a lot of countries aren't as prudish about paying for sex as America is.
Take a vacation to Amsterdam and enjoy the red light district.
You can fuck some pretty hot girls for $50-$100 for a 10-15 minute quicky.
Pay them with XMR.
Then both parties get privacy.
Win, win.
You're narcissistic for thinking anyone would give a shit about you, especially the hooker you hire.
Who gives a shit if they tell the world when every transaction is recorded on the blockchain.
It's already there for the world to see
Then don't hire whores god damn, be honest with yourself, if your stupid wife and kids have a problem with what you did when you were young tell them to go fuck themselves
lol
if your stupid wife and kids have a problem with what you did when you were young tell them to go fuck themselvesYour future wife probably took several dicks in the ass back in college so its only fair for you to fuck hookers when you're young too.
I like my hookers like I like my cutlery....plastic and disposable.
Either don't become famous or don't hire hookers if it bothers you.
>bothered by hiring hookers>knows people who'll be bothered by him hiring hookersYou're not in finance I see.
