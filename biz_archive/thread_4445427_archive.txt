Stop being Pajeets
Legit just hold for at least one week it'll rebound.
guess I should stop checking cmc every 3 minutes
Yep, just let it chill a bit.
Not saying bag it for 1 month, but give it until early next week.
Worst case you'll be able to exit for break-even if you're feeling the weigh of the bags.
I don't wanna sound like a fagbut if this moons it will be my first gainzany idea what the ath will be
They are being added to more exchanges (other than Kucoin thank fuck) in the coming week or two and by December they'll be announcing what major corporations they've partnered with.
The market cap is so, so tiny compared to what they are ABLE to do, it isn't unheard of for it to go 10x.
I'm not saying hold only until you hit 10x, but sell on the way up.
Get your cost average low or near-nothing and then sit on the coins.
At the same time, follow the project and watch for anything that could potential harm the value.
Don't give in to FUD, do your own research, but also learn when to sell at a small loss to minimize risk.
Personally, I'm holding these until mid-to-late December.
