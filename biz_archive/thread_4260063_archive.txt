Hi guys,Im appealing to your good 4chan natures and hopefully theres a couple of people with more money then sense here that could help a poor bugger out.My girlfriend has accidently destroyed the laptop, whilst we were moving houses, and my paper backup has been lost in transit.
Hard to take in atm.
Hard drive seems completely destroyed.
Only hope is the paper wallet but she thinks she might've thrown it out...I know its unlikely but hoping someones feeling generous.
