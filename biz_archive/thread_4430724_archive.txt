MODUM is a blockchain agnostic application for relaying data from temperature sensors in pharmaceutical shipments to the blockchain for data integrity.
In their whitepaper they specifically mention using NEO at some point.
MOD board of directors member Dr. Thomas Bocek will be presenting alongside NEO's Da Hongfei in Shanghei http://www.swissnexchina.org/en/event/future-of-moneyseries-coming-to-china/Why is MOD mooning?
Because insiders know that a collaboration between MOD and NEO is underway as China is gearing up to let blockchain tech and ICO's breathe again.
I have a source for this information that goes beyond speculation but this is the most I can say here.
Take this info as you will, the collaboration will be announced on the 21st.
as an aside, MOD also positioning itself in the IOT market apart form pharmaceutical shipmentshttps://www.cio.com/article/3235138/data-protection/how-blockchain-is-hastening-the-advance-of-autonomous-cars.html
