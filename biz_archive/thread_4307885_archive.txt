Dear Biz/ Sell your SALT Lending tokens fast.Salt is getting dumped hard soon.My friend has purchased from pre-sale for 0.25$ and he does dump at you.
Get out and buy lower.$ELL $ALT FAST!
Good news if this is true cuz i can't wait to jump on this token.
hey friend i am pretty sure you wont take part to this dump.
we are going 1.5$ or even below
 implying it's going to drop to 1.5$Get out of here pajeet kek
So your friend didn't sell at ATH 2 months ago and is going to sell now that the product is almost out?Seems to me you have no friends so you might as well kys today m8
Just sell.
GOD YES PLEASE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A JUICY DIP DURING THIS WHOLE BCC CRAP
Why would your one friend have control over the market?
There are lots of other people who got in at the same price and have already sold or are holding.
your friend doesn't existbecause if he did, he would wait until salt hits ath and set an alert to sell, and if he already dumped then its priced in
I'll buy your salt OP.
