You can listen or not, you will see when it pumps again
oh yes let's pump this 3.5 billion cap coin to $620 from $458 I don't think anyone on /biz/ is stupid enough to believe your pathetic attempt to sell your bags.
At least I hope so.
Quoted this just to look back.BCH pumped to a high marketcap, its possible.
yes BCH pumped because millions of BTC holders decided individually to sell their coins, not because a couple hundred idiots at most from a pump and dump group decided to decrease its price
I doubt youre right but I sure hope.
It did pump to $650 earlier for a few minutes so I guess it is possible
alright op
when it pumps againYou just gave yourself away right there.... ffs
