Anyone here had good/bad experiences with bittrex?Keep hearing a lot of stories about peoples accounts getting frozen for "no reason" and shit.
Just wondering what the anons here have to say.
bittrex is shityou will need to send selfie and ID to withdraw.site is always laggy ASFtakes support weeks to respondstay away
I think Bittrex is possible because it was a fully KYC compliant ICO for a project with good utility and it was hard-capped @ 15M.
They listed MANA and fucking Viberate.
CND reached the ICO hard cap and has only appreciated 30% (to about 20m) post-token release which makes for strong Bittrex entry pump possibilities.
The low current cap is (in my opinion) mostly due to the Cindicator team spreading FUD on their own coin and shitting on any "but muh profit" complaints of their ICO buyers...
They actively disuaded ICO buyers who were purely profit seeking through their KYC process, including requiring them to write essays.I got accepted into the ICO based on my essay / occupation, but couldn't pass KYC because burger.
This project has real potential to be a $500m cap project in the medium (1-2 year) term.
Hybrid intelligence modeling works and their models beat the market by leaps and bounds.
Don't buy if you don't want to, but I would encourage some good DYOR on this before you write it off.
It has many of the marks of a durable project including - very importantly - a currently functioning product.
Already bought at ICO
Richie fuckface from Bittrex tweeted some shit about adding CND and then deleted it.
Who knows
