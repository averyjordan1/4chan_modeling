what is it with Asians and glasses?
I am confident that 70-90% of all Chinese men wear glasses.
Is it genetic?
is it because of a cultural difference, where they wear glasses for even the smallest reduction in sight.
It’s a nazi thing
It's mostly environmental.
The previous generation of Chinese children were pressured to work inside so much for school they developed myopia at a staggering rate.
Underexposure to sunlight at a young age doesn't let the eye develop the way it needs to.
~80% of young adults have myopia in China.
So that their tiny eyes will appear larger
Bet you did nazi that coming XDXDXDXD

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT fuck with Jihan.
I have personally dealt with him professionally many times over the last years.
This guy is THE textbook definition of a psychopath.
He is deeply connected with PLA Unit 61398, the Chinese government, SVR/FSB, Academi(AKA Blackwater) and several other intelligence agencies all over the world.
He doesn't fuck around.He will LITERALLY and unironically annihilate you if you stand in his way.
I have said too much.
An upcoming WikiLeaks dump will reveal who truly Jihan is.
Be careful.
