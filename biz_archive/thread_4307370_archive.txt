DRP currently has a $6m market cap with 8m tokens in circulation.
It is selling at 85 cents on Etherdelta and Cryptopia.DCORP is the first fucking decentralized venture capitalism firm.This means DRP token holders can vote to fund projects they like (by converting to DRPS), and receive dividends on all projects funded (converting to DRPS).
In the stock market, average dividend yield is usually 2%.
So for you to make $1 you need to invest $50.
For DCORP to pay out $1 dividends to token holders it only needs to make $8m.
Please fucking think about that for a second.
Imagine how much in dividends it will be paying out as the VC platform takes off.
The VC platform, along with a new site is set to be launched THIS DECEMBER.
Their team already confirmed they have plenty of projects in store to be submitted December 1st.DCORP is also making a decentralized derivatives exchange (with leveraging).
The derivatives market is insanely huge, I hope I don't need to explain this too.
The DEX is scheduled for Q2 2018.So anon, why should I buy in right now?
low market cap tokens explode without warning.
The VC platform is scheduled for release in December, and DRP will also be on HitBTC December 1st, as the projects flood in.
DRP will go at least x5 in value before 2018, screencap this post.
ughhh deletughh accumilatingughh fud disughh dont buy pajeet dis threadughh stop shill no deserve ughhhughhhughhhhhh
In all reality, once the dust settles on the btc/bch battle, this is an alt I'll definitely be pouring gains into.
It is on sale right now, but I simply don't have the liquidity to buy right now.
don't count on the train waiting for you
Train is gonna go crazy on this one.
We gonna make it boys.
