Never, they add only reliable coins after a deep due diligence, not worthless vapor wave.
I have a feeling that this is gonna be kept as low key as possible until the mainnet is live
Deluded trixie

Exchanges dont give a fuck how legit a coin is.
As long as it has a public ledger they can profit off its movement.
When they decide they want to be listed on exchanges they will be on GDAX and Kraken.
What would that change?Same whale groups would move to Bittrex and control it as well, Link would be kept under 20 cents
Yeah, just like BitBean, right?
You have to divy up your funds between exchanges.
That makes it more competitive for other whale groups.
wtf you talking about?
They've added like 6-7 since Bitcoin Cash.
