But, I want a tribe.
open-office meme that makes it harder to get concentrate on work but oh well as long as we're cool and trendy corporateI can't fucking stand this.
Cheap CEOs putting all the cattle in one room, but the executives never work there, they always have private offices.
This pic always gets me, he looks like a younger version of my boss.
Same glasses, same haircut, even the same shitty type of outfit he normally wears.
