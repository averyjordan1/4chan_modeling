Why?
So Asians can dump it and make all the $.
American whales are mostly invested in traditional financial instruments whereas many (not all) Chinese whales see BTC as a way to subvert Chinese capital controls.This is why Bithumb in Korea has the most volume.
They are a 0 fee exchange (just like the old ones in China) and the trading on these Korean exchanges is mostly being done by Chinese investors.
Once CME futures arrive next month American and European investors will have a legitimate way to heavily invest in BTC.
Then you will see volumes move back West.
