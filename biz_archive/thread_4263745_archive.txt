When will BTC be worth $1mil?
Never bro
Why Not?
because satoshi would be a quadrillionaire and crash the fucking world economy when he comes out of hiding
2026-2030 bet my D
when you can wipeyour bunghole with that usless paper
That's more than the entire U.S. money supply, so probably never.
Unless there is super extreme hyperinflation x 10.
$100k is possible by 2025 though
This Satoshi is one low-ass time preference mutherfucka.
