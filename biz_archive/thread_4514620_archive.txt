ME> Going long on bitcoin and ether> Having a fun time with friends and family while making money> Literally don't give a shit> Sleep well at nightYOU> Day "trading" aka speculating like cuck> Trading based on emotion and anxiety> Make 5 dollar gains a day and then lose 20 the next> Wake up in cold sweats in the middle of the night> Erectile dysfunction from gains anxiety > Smell terrible from lack of proper hygiene caused by your depression of being poorThe question is why are you not just setting and forgetting your money until it matures and you can then spend the rest of your time making money and having fun in other ways?
Because you made 10x this year and I made 50x.
Because when you don't have a lot of money, a x2 will not change your life.
If you ha e at least 20k ton invest go in btc eth xmr.
But when you're a poorfag like me with 3k you need to try the bad way.
Work for some, some stagnate (me), some loose everything
4514620But the crazy thing is, both of these posters actually lost money gambling on alts and are now merely roleplaying!
>mfw i got in with $400 and now im up to $600 thanks to day "trading" and going after 5-10% profits and not giving a shit about the coin after that, except for more 5-10% profits
Every time I see someone reply like you I feel sad for them because the odds are that you yourself lost money if you're so skeptical of others having had gains.
>be me>put entire 40k portfolio in shitcoins>gain 150k in one month just to lose it all the next month>still nauseous when thinking about losses>mostly emotionally numb at this point>daily portfolio volatility equal to 2 month's salary>dgaf anymore>anxiety almost gonewelp
Well, if you got into crypto in may or earlier this year you'd have to have been an absolute retard not to make crazy gains.
If you got in july or later, it's more or less a matter of luck whether you made gains or not due to all the bullshit that happened.
I started with $250.
Went into RDD, XBY, and DGB and sold at all of there ATMs.
Later on I snagged ANS at $6.
Now I have 15k and while I think I did great, I look at my BTC value now, vs when I first made gains on those three coins and I went from 3BTC to today being at less than 2.If I would have just held BTC with those initial gains...
I would be so much better off.
I had a similar scenario except with 5k>turn 5k into 19k>then NMR happens>worth 3kheh
Got back into crypto in March, saw the writing on the wall in July and went 80% BTC then.
I started trading with crypto today and made 50 bucks on an investment of 280$, just flipping POWR lol
And Every time I see someone reply like you I feel sad for them because the odds are that you yourself lost money if you're so skeptical of others having had gains
