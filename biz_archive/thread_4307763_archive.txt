Buy the BTC dip retardsBCH is just a hyped P&DDon't get fooled by the chinks
that looks like an inverted h&s...
Yeah, that's a bullish patternThis is the BTC chart
There's a bigger falling wedge formation if you zoom out.
nice 5 min chart, now kys
falling wedge is also a bullish indicator
This isnt the final bottom.
We will bounce to upper trendline but I think continue downwards near 4.6k
Epic chance to go long on BTC coming up..
