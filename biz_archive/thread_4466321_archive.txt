Hi 500k club bro.
Where is this post?
DiscordLooks like the guy is the same one who dropped ~500 ETH on ED recently and has purchased an additional ~$400k USD worth
I really wanted to hit 1M before it took off but it looks like that’s not going to happen.
Still, I’m very happy with this amount.
Going to be a nice clean $100k USD near the middle of next year.
Cool, I didn't know they had a Discord.
Thanks.
No problemo, good luck
It's just losers.
And conspiracy theories.
yeah but some of them have a lot of money
yeah like the guy who has lost 400k in crypto
and he's proud of that for some reason
kind of worrying because he only invests in pie in the sky shit that will fail.
lol.
inverse broken clock i guess
