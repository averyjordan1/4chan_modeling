Srs question here.
No coiner faygit starting out .. what is the best way to get all the top coins wallets in one place and tie it to my phone with i guess blockfolio?
how should i go about this?
Blockfolio just tells you what you have.
It doesn’t do anything else
So do I need to go to each coins official website dl and create a wallet or ??
googlecome back when you have a more substantial question
Generally speaking, it isn’t smart holding coins on exchanges but 90% of anons here do it.
Just buy what you want and leave it there unless there’s a coin with staking rewards or something.
