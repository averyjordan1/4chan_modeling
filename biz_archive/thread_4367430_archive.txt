>bittrex doesn't have trailing stop losses why kind of primitive system is this?
Stop losses are for faggots.
The only stop loss is the grave
it's a very normie-esque exchange
It annoys me too OP.
Also annoys me how the chart doesnt update itself often at all.
You have to look at the order book to see trades, the chart refreshes maybe once every 3 minutes
