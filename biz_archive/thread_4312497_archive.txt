Whale hereTip for newbiesYes, it's now too risky to get into BCH.
Smart money like us entered in straight after the fork was cancelled.The late smart money is now holding into one of the top 10 alt coins.
I recommend NEO until this fiasco dies down.Will a flippening happen?
It's possible but my analysis pegs it at a 10% chance.
Why?>jihan and roger are incompetent leaders>china is notorious for dumping and will hurt many people believing the hodl propaganda>all btc core needs to do is say "ok we give in, segwit 2x it is" and bcash will dump that minuteWhatever happens BTC will never be the same after this.
Adam Back is a retard and he is lucky that he is succeeding on BTC's name alone.
shut up jihan is based and is a genius
Whale hereTip for newbiesGo all in BCH
shut up jihan is based and is a geniustoo obvious
You don't need to put "whale"in your post.
No whale would say "whale" here asan introduction.
However, whatever you wrote after makes perfect sense.
not a whale here.
bcc has no transactions and infrastructure or adoption.
this is a pump and dump with already mined coins being sold with hype.
but i am a whale
The absence of transactions is alarminghttps://fork.lol/tx/txs
Why neo?
What about eth or ltc?
those are safe right?
lol shutup you fat fuck
