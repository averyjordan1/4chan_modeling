I'm looking for strategies to attack competitor email newsletters in my niche.How can I hit their email lists without breaking the law?These are not nice guys or major companies.
They're small timers who scrape emails and spam daily.
This is a very competitive niche dominated by a small group with a powerful email spamming network.I notice many of them aren't listing addresses on their emails which violates CAN SPAM laws.Will reporting this to the FTC do anything?Is there anything else I can do to damage an email list that isn't blatantly illegal?Offering up to 0.01 for the best serious answer.
What a unique way to bail from the crypto market
Sure there is lots of ways, but you aren't going to get it out of a pro for .01 BTC.
This kind of thing takes tech skill.
Sent validation requests to test if the emails are legit.
it gets flagged as spam most the time and then has to be checked by an actual human.
It will cost a lot depending on how many resources you put into it.Literally 5 lines of code with SMTP.
Why can't it be illegal?
Do you want to win or fight fair?
I'd be happy to even have a direction where to go for these "services."
It doesn't seem like something you can just post an ad for on Craigslist or Upwork.
Hey man, I could do it for you for like 3 days, but if thats the case you need to get paying asap.
that .01 BTC is becoming worth less and less by the second.
forward one of the emails here:D-goqe1f17kd0nr8o78@maildrop.cc

Alright, I'm closing the mailbox tab.
That was a weird no response, man.
I was going to hook you up.
It's kind of crazy that there just so happened to be someone who could actually do this on biz at the same time you posted this, and then you missed that opportunity.
Like, I kind of feel like that's got to be some lottery odds type shit.
