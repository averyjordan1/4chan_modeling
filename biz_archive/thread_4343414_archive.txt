Ok. No shills here.
An actual thread.
An actual question and actual food for thought./Biz/ don't you think the forkening and attacks had anything to do with the asic2 exploit and 'patented miners', made by the BCH team?Segwit2x would have destroyed their exploit and thus the need for patented 'asicboost' miners.
The flippening to Segwit2x was what everyone was actually bracing for.That's why BCH was created, right, to save this patented exploit?
Where does this all fit in?
At least people are finding more and more pieces to this puzzle.
