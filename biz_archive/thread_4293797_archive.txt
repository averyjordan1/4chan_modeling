Daily Reminder
God fucking dammit.

BTC>reversibleYou're a fucking idiot pajeet.
Enjoy the cents you're getting for shilling a shitcoin on this board and go shit on another street.
Says increasingly nervous man.
should hope it drops even farther so you can rebuy with the profits you just made selling.
Pajeet is right tho.You can make a transaction with a very low fee to someone and then making another transaction with the same bitcoins with a higher fee, the higher fee transaction will get processed and the low fee transaction will be denied because the transaction with a high fee will be already confirmed.It's fucking Bitcoin 101.
Thats why 6 confirmations has ALWAYS been standard for buying anything with bitcoin.
Now, 1 conf is probably fine and is irreversible in almost all circumstances.
BCH only has 'fast' (maximum speed the same as BTC) transactions because there is no competition for block-space because no fucking people are transacting with BCH, they are speculating with it only.
4295105Has this been exploited at all?
Are there any websites that accept the payment once the transaction is put in the mempool?
Because I could fake-buy a LOT of shit that way :)
Because I could fake-buy a LOT of shit that wayGood fucking luck you criminal piece of shit.Go ahead and try but only digital goods released the instant you 'pay' will be available to you.
Nobody is going to ship if the transaction doesn't confirm.
You may get some digital shit, but you can't really resell that.
Everyone who understands bitcoin waits for a confirmation.
