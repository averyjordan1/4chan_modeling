YYYYEEEEEAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
YEAH BABY
Why is SALT mooning suddenly?
Wtf happening?
Some news?
Halp, I'm new to crypto.. do I sell now and buy back in when it starts to dip?
IF IT STARTS TO DIP?
always sell a portion on the way up along with bringing your stop loss up for the rest.
Sell on the way up to lower your cost average.
Pick a % gains you feel comfy with then unload past that amount.
If you own 1,000 SALT and you're up about 10%, i normally say fuck it and go for more.
Up 30%+ I usually sell 20%-30% based on the coin, upcoming news, etc.
Never sell 100% unless it was a PnD for some upcoming shit news or something (ripple is a perfect all-in ride the pump then dump coin).
SALT is a long term hold, but take profits on the ride.
thank you anon, you helped me immensely.
stop talking about this coin you retard
