Congrats on this.
Seriously
LTC will unironically become the king one day.
BTC vs BCC, pedo skelly coin.. they are literally dying, paving the way for LTC to take the throne.
I honestly think LTC has a lot of room to grow, but it's kind of bullshit to say that BTC & ETH are dying.
BCH is fucked though.
maker of ETH is pedo> ETH isn't dyingK
Sell ETH and regret it.
It's not going anywhere.
I did sell ETH and buy LTC.I'd rather not be apart of something that's in relation to that of supporting CP.inb4 feds bust pedo skelly for possession of CP n fox & friends is talking about it on national tv.
