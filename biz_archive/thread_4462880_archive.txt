By tomorrow morning I'd say it's AUD $1.2 if not 1.5 or more...I'm hoping it's not above $1.75 though, hoping I can continue to invest while it's still relatively low...2 months from now projections are showing possibly $20-25
I hate the banks.Why do they take a whole day to transfer my money?!
Do you realize what kind of market cap it'd need to reach 20-25 in 2 months?
Can you explain me how do i keep POWR in a wallet?
I haven't found any on their website.
my ether wallet
 Have you not seen the market cap growth in the last 48 hours?
you use any ERC20 compliant walletmyetherwallet is fine
Easy 100$ eoy
20-25 a bit high 1.50 is realistic, this will put powr in top 20 market cap
this is what everyone was saying about OMG and look how that eternal bag hold folded out.
Not saying this baby won't moon a bit but $25 by the end of the year seems a bit high don't you think?
