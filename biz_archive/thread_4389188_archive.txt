As general market research, if you are a straight guy, how much money would you, hypothetically, charge a gay guy to let him spank you?
It would likely cause bruising.It would be with pants up (likely thin athletic shorts, so you still feel something), consist of one minute of hard-as-you-can spanking, and the spanking would be with the back of a hairbrush so the gay guyâ€™s hand would never touch your butt.
However, you would be over the gay guy's lap.
It would be a hard spanking that is extremely painful.
Sitting may be somewhat uncomfortable for a number of hours afterwords; however, you would still be able to do so.If there is no amount, say so.
Otherwise, please note the currency too, if not in USD.
$300 an hour.
No lower than $200.
$1,000
I would be willing to take 50 AntShares as payment for such a task.
$2,000 but only for traps, I wouldn't let a masculine faggot do it
