Marketcap was 600-800M yesterday, for that kind of project it is very low
um yes-full product launches in 3 weeks-still under ico price-partnership with chinese companies confirmed-applied for several exchange listings including bittrex-easily 15 mil market cap after product launch
So it's comfy hold from here.But is it about to pump again before the fork ?
PAJEET ALERTPROBABLY SAMEFAGGING AGAIN, SEE PIC RELATEDMade the same thread yesterday, also starting with "not shilling here."
welcome aboard newfag.
the only wise thing to do right now is to buy MORE and HODL.
if you joined their telegram you'd hear about new exchanges and that's when we going straight to the moon
Oh right I remember the guy shilling this started with "not shilling " too..But desu, I bought this yesterday after I saw it getting shill on biz.
Bought at very low price and I already did decent gainz.I'm not that guy, I never shill, I believe in karma the last times I shilled I got fucked so never do it again.
What's with the Triforce logo?
Link partnership confirmed?
I think OP is being honest.
Maybe it's you who fud this to accumulate more ?
