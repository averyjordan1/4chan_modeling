https://squawker.org/technology/wall-st-controls-bitcoin-and-bitcoin-cash-we-are-being-played/Interesting read, what alt will actually come out on top?
Btc will eventually be centralized and die.
everything will eventually die, as long as you cash out in time then you'll be fine
ETH and XMR are solid.ETH is corporate platform.
It's valuable outside of currency.
XMR is for the original users of BTC that actually used the coin.
Also, JewCoin is a feature and the reason to invest.
The elite desperately want a one world currency.
BTC is there way in, they will make it popular and adopted, then they will crash it and then they will buy it all up.All you have to do is accumulate BTC and then when it crashes never sell.
It will come rising back up and you will be the winner.
not selling the top and buying the crash>not becoming one of the jews>you ever winning
No, if you hold on to BTC through all the turmoil it will be worth a lot because it will the one world currency that almost every single Western elite wants.
ETH isn't scalable.XMR is solid though.
There isn't gonna be a 'one-world currency'.
All sorts of crypto will continue to exist
this, except replece bitcoin (lol) with bitbean.Don't be a nobeaner when tomorrow comes.
Yes there is and it's going to be BTC.
The Davos elite want globalization and there main weapon is economic interdependence and a one world currency backed by the powers that be will be huge in making this happen.
No you cant really manipulate anything to go down.
So control would mean 100-200k handle, which is good for retail hodlers-
falling for clickbait for normiesAnd you'll eventually cash out in the thing that is going to die, instead of holding what's the next reserve currency.
Damn bruh
the banks are doing literally nothing with btc/btc-cash, but we are worried about losing market share, which is why we're now starting to offer cheap/instant payment systems for customers and institutional transferst.
