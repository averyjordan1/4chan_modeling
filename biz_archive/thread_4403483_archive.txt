Daily reminder that BTC will be worth $100K in 5 years, rsfags understand this
You're retarded if you think this Bitfinex tether bullshit will last for 5 years lmao.
Keep telling that to yourself, you will be pinkwojacking while the people who previously played rs and experienced the whole thing will very well know this will become a reality, true /biz/nessmen will be millionaires while you hanged yourself for selling too low trying to predict the "top"
Reminder that the pajeets and ahmeds that are infesting /biz/ right now will be long gone in 5 years since they sold the """top""" or gambled it all away on worthless shitcoins like (((LINK))) or whatever the fuck the next shitty ERC-20 or BTC copycat altcoin is going to be
God I fucking hope so, /biz/ has gone to shit after all the Jamals, Rahjeets and normies from reddit started pouring in the last 3 months... fuck.
I want old /biz/ back
