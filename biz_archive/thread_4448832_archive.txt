Because right now it's -2x from it's ATH.ZRX will be used to pay fees on the Radar Relay exchange which currently has a working beta.
It's basically a fancier ED utilizing metamask which normies will never understand.
Hell some of us retards struggle with ED (kek).
RR can be used to buy/sell/swap literally any ERC-20 token.I started seeing 0x get shilled a few months ago but seems to have fallen off the map.
Is this just another shit fee token like BNB which has also had shit performance other than its initial pump?Please discuss.Bagholding a couple hundred that's down 25% and thinking of selling for BTC or one of my big boy alts.
ZRX won't just be used to pay fees on RR, it will be used to pay fees on any ZRX exchange and there's a shitload of them coming.
Once ethfinex gets released (yes, it's made by bitfinex) this bad boy will moon at least 100%.
Ah good point I completely overlooked that there will be numerous exchanges.Probably no real action for at least 3-6 months if https://blog.ethfinex.com/the-ethfinex-roadmap-7c7cd82c835c is still current.Guess I'll just check on it every now and then.
Definitely a mid-long term hold.
