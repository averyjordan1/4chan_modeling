Need some ideas.
What is something I could buy on Amazon (uk or eu) that I could then sell for as close to face value as possible?
Amazon giftcards
a really realistic mask
Where can I sell giftcards for face value, I'm trying to use mine thats the issue.
I need something I can then sell for cash, rather than say sell for btc/ wire etc..
Not tryna get taxed huh?
