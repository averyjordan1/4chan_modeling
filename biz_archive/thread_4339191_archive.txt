ARK MOON THREAD GET IN HERE
Aint no shitcoins mooning till the king decides he's done pumping
You're probably right.
I'm ~60% in the King.
Great for predictable gains, but I wanna 10x something.
$30 ARK is very doable.
The problem with Ark is, WHEN it finally moons it'll go very, very fast, so no choice but to hodl Ark all the time, if I wake up and Ark is > $5 I'd literally kill myself if not holding any
They aren't stupid enough to announce anything until this bch btc drama dies down anyway.Pretty much all alt coins have holding back announcements I'm sure with all the btc drama lately.. segwit2x and now this bcash shit.
I'm really looking forward to just seeing bitcoin finally stabilize and having a month of alt markets with all the new money that's been brought in lately.
>tfw staking Ark its a good feeling
Oh yeah 100$ by eoy 2018 inshallah
