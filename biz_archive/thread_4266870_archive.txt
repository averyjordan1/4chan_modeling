Ready for the NULS rebound?
HERE WE GO
Got in just in time
I think I love this chink coin
Please moon again.. please

I'm riding this motherfucker to at least $30.
WE GOIN UP BOISPUT ON THOSE SPACE HELMETS

Huge sell walls now.
This wont end well
Enough people are seeing the upward trend, sell wall diminishing
there's some impediment on the BTC pairing, but the BNB pairing is looking turgid
See you therehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hxibHJOE5E
The BNB pairing has no volume to do shit.Also, did you read the whitepaper, I had a cold shiver down the spine.
It smells fishy, very fishy.I'm not saying you should not make profit now, but keep an eye for the exit point (not at 40x, not even close lol).
Can't wait until this guy comes back after the third moon.
He's going to be so JUST'd... Hard.
TO THE MOOOOOOOON
Think it's going to tank around $1.20?
Who here #diditforthenuls?
What's so scary about the white paper lol
i wish i had gotten that sell off at $1.15 yesterday to rebuy at $.70 today your guess is as good as mine anon
Their roadmad is scheluded to achieve the program in "1-2 and 3-5 years", what the fuck does is mean?
I can't see a single name or face of the devs, advisors etc.
It seems written by a kindergarden retard, it only give you basic informations.There are magnificient gems with 30+ pages of technicals whitepapers actually stagnant.This thing went parabolic for no reason at all, I will always say thanks to the OP of the other night that made the thread but I wouldn't feel comfy to sleep with it when the hype will be over.
Or do you really expect 100% gains every day for "3-5" years?
Anyway whoever bought NULS when it was only paired with BNB is absolutely comfy, this is true...It's impossible to tank below $0.30.
that fucking buy wall tho
Their devs are InChain devs.
Check both projects github contributors - same people.InChain has some serious partnerships in China and you can see that the devs can def code at InChains github page.
