Is a $118K sell order $359 holding the price for over 30 minutes a natural and expected thing?
WTF is going on here?
Same shit but a buy order on bittrex.
hmmmmm
price suppression
Why?
I get it that someone does not want the price to go above 360, but why?Aaaaand it's falling.
accumulationits actually not a meme when it comes to top tier coins like ethbut it could also be greedy ico dumping their eth stash
Who's the Bitcoin whale?
So it tanks and conveniently hits a buy wall of roughly the same size at 355.
Hmmmmmm.
