buy the dip
I can't, my money is trapped in LINK.
>want to put ETH into ark during this brief dip>can't get myself out of bed because too comfy
Same kinda.
Hanging out with my bro in real life right now, but don't want to be a jerk just to buy the dip
I hate money
Just sold 3 BTC at 7100$.
Why would I spend it on ARK?
Because you don't want to be a sinner once the flood starts
ARK NEO and OMG and your set for life desu
Because Lisk is a cheap copy from Ark, they just have better marketing for now.
Ark needs no marketing.
It's the same ask Antshares which became Neo, was undervalued, too.
