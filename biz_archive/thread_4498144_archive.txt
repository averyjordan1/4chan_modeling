Is there any hope for it, /biz/?
lol i held this shit from 11k sats all the way to 25k sats and now hold these shitty bags forever.to answer your question though, unlikely, it's probably dead for good...im holding in case it surges back to 10k sats somehow and dump my bags right away.
To avoid sunken cost fallacy, think about it this way.
What has the most chance of going upwards in the near future, golem, or some other thing you know about?If the answer is some other thing you know about, you put your money from golem into that.Ignore the feeling that this means you accept that you lost money on it.
It's just emotional fluff.
The fact is right now you have X value and that X value is in golem and it could be in something else that have a higher chance of going up.
After 3-4 months
Sell and buy RLC instead
good point
no.
dump your bags now.
Buy POWR.
decentralized supercomputera completely retarded ideasolves zero problems
Fuck golem.
Invest in RLC or TIO instead.
I still hold some, but only in a sort of pascals wager against Roko's Basilisk.
