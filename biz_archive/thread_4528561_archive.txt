Biz, tell what the story is with this...I want to go all in on it considering what happend to bch.>Am I deluded?
It is the one true Bitcoin so yeah go all in
No this is a complete shit coin with bitcoin in its name thatâ€™s mined with gpus it will never be part of the asic miner war between cash and btc
Shitcoin, they fucked up the fork a ton and it took forever for them to get the mainnet functioning.
Were people not saying bch was a shitcoin for ages though?
I bought just in case.
BCH fork had some issues but compared to BTG it went smoothly.
Also who's backing this?
Some random people acting like bitcoin but with no ASICs is great?
There are so many shitcoins that already use GPU mining.
It also has no scaling solution whatsoever.
The argument for BCH over BTC is that some say the scaling option is superior which it definitely is at least shortterm, there's an argument over which is better longterm though.
BTG on the other hand is strictly inferior to both.
