Whales compete with other whales
Why don't you actually sit down and think about what you're missing instead of making shitty threads on a Congolese farm equipment trading board
Yes, but - it works both ways.
when you sell the price instantly goes down.
well you'd need support underneath what you just pumped to take a profit, other wise the price would just plummet when you tried to cash out.
Whales take big risk when they pump alone when they work together there is less risk but of course greed takes over eventually and whale wars break out.
It's our job as little shrimp to feed on the bits and chunks they tear off each other.
If you're a shrimp be a shrimp don't fall for fomo never invest more than your willing to loose.
Good luck selling 300 btc all at once.
300 btc would hardly move prices.
But yes, this is an easily manipulable market.
