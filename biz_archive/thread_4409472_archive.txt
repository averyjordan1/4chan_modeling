wtf is happening to ASTRO?
a shitcoin tanking after founders sold off post-ICO?
happens about 3 times every daytime to move on to a serious coin
Price jumped massively because there was so little sell volume and people got FOMO.
Now some people are taking profits (at 3x profit in one day), and some weak hands are getting nervous and selling.
You know the fools who buy at 0.009, then panic sell when it hits 0.006?
They are causing a little dump at the moment.
They'll FOMO back in at 0.012, then post endless threads complaining that they are getting JUSTed once again when it drops to 0.011.Smart money is just watching and accumulating, waiting for new exchanges and dividends to send this moon-wards again.
i actually need it to go back down to 0.0054 levels so i can buy in what i bought at yesterday.
10k still waiting to get picked up by these weak hands
ED is like Las Vegas, fellow being.
The people controlling the game will always win
getting JUST'd
Someone should put a wojak inside the astrosuit
pump my coin daddy pls sirs
