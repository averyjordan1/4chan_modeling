im currently working on my website for my christmas project for biz,pajeets dont celebrate christmas, so they wont get any packages, should i include that, or would that make me seem like a /pol/tard?Or is it obvious?
we do have national holiday on 25 dec and I spend the whole day watching Christmas movies and eating fruit cake if that counts
