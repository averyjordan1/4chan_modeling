ROUND 2
why
Because CMC is only now showing it's low market cap.
We're at 5 million now
 fucking million coins for the devs?

Yeah lets fund a whole payment solution off no capital...
Binance.
if its binance they need some sort of working prototype afaik - shouldn't be difficult for them to produce that
Also it's currently selling higher on KuCoin than on EtherDelta, so the Koreans are driving up the price
binance listed nuls which doesn't even have a whitepaper
>mfw whitelisted but didnt participate
Well yeah, you should be extremely concerned if they held any less.
Keep in mind that the devs don't get a single cent from transactions on their platform: only token holders do.
So if they didn't hold enough tokens to earn substantial dividends, they would have no stake whatsoever in the long-term success of the project.
Their token holdings combined with how little they chose to raise directly from the ICO are promising signs.
It doesn't mean their product will be any good or even a success at all, but it does mean they have no incentive to just run away with the money.
It also means they arent selling their tokens, theyre waiting for those sweet, sweet dividends.
joost said that they need to show smth like a prototype, but that isn't a big thing
