26 BTC plus about 3 BTC in alts.
Used to be around 7 BTC in alts until alts all crashed relative to BTC.
Stupid of me to think investing in altcoins was a good idea.
I should sell before they lose even more value, but I keep holding out hope that some of them will turn around and moon.
Unlikely though that they'll moon at a higher rate than BTC.
how high is it unironically going to go?
Seems like alt coins have higher potential returns short term.
do it richfags, make me less fragile to current economic situation

I'm guessing BTC k by the end of the year, major alts about where they are now, maybe a little higher, minor alts all down

I hope you've all got at least 10 moneroI mean its still really cheap, considering almost the entire dark web has switched to it.While BTC and BCH continue to bash each others brains out, monero is a solid betIf you have less than 0.5 BTC then i mean you may as well just all in on XMR tbqh

Should I but another $200 worth?You should buy however much you're capable of losing
okay anon, thanks for the advice.
only put in what I can afford to loose I guess.
Shame I got into this just before christmas.
Hopefully I can pump some in afterwards.shilling aside, how likely is it that btc will fucking break and be worth nothing within the next few years?how likely is it that it will just keep climbing?
Only 0.936 BTCWill I make it guys??
Bought one in 2014 for $450, fucker continued to drop to like 250.
Kinda forgot about it for next three years/didn't really pay attention to bitcoin.
Heard about bitcoin again recently, oh shit its up to 5k wtf!
So fucking pissed I didn't buy more.
Now i'm here cause i'm an idiot and came here to listen to more idiotic advice about crypto i guess.glad I bought one at least, but fucking sad I didn't buy more.
I only have $500 Dollars worth should have bought back when I saw it at $50 but I was young and dumb
you would have only needed about $1,000 worth and you would have made it today =(The price has never dropped to 50 ever since.I know your feels man.
easy come, easy go, buy ATH, sell all time low
tfw i know this feel
Just sent you 0.1 BTC bro, gl!
