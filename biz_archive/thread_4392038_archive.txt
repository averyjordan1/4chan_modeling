its pretty widely discussed that was a pump and dump + ddos + dodgy shutdown of the korean exchangeit wont work again like that
THESE BAGS ARE STARTING TO CRUSH ME
Yeah dude.
The people with the most BCH would totally DDOS and shut down the korean exchange to prevent themselves from gaining way more net worth in a flippening than they could from selling off less than 0.5% of their personal BCH holdings on the way from 2600USD back to 1300USD.Totally makes sense bro.
Merely a pump and dump dawgs.
corecucks were the ones ddosing.
Yeah and it's really baffling how corelings seem to FUD BCH by saying it was a part of a pump and dump strategy by Jihan, Ver & Co.
I'm starting to wonder if it's an agreed upon FUD strategy in groups that go out and shill "it's just a pump and dump guys you got memed on".
