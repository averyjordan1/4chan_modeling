How does one go about starting a business that requires outside contracting from a practical standpoint?
Should I look around and try to contract some companies, and if so, how?
Or do I have to have connections?
You need to be able to write up watertight contracts so that if partnerships fail you dont get fucked in the ass
write up watertight contractsWas thinking more along the lines of finding people for it, but that is fairly important as well, especially when it comes to finding ways to deal with different level companies.
Any good books on that subject?
Also whats the business OP im a 4th year construction student and have learnt lots about the importance of outside contracting and contracts in general
Literally just use google, find what local avaliable resources there are and do your own research.thats what entrepenuership and starting a business is all about.
Theoretically if you have good judgement and can use knowledge to your advantage you can figure out who its worth working with.
