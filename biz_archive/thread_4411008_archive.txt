CHN,LINK,ARK, REQGuys is it just me or does everything /biz/ gets heavily involved in and buys go down the toilet?
/biz/ shilled $3 ETH like crazy a year ago
/biz/ is not what it use to be.Back when it still had /g/ blood in its veins.Now its a new greedy generation with no understanding of technology.The pajeets use their lack of /g/entooman blood and greed against them.
Every.
Single.
Time.
Also, Ark is a solid coin but the others are shit.
This is the sad thing about it.BTC and alts went down last time after /g/ banned crypto threads
They shilled Waves this time last year like fucking everyday.
Wish i listened then.
Biz isn't always right, but it sure isn't wrong all the time.
#4CHNallday.
True but I see ARK is recoding their project to makes their code more clean and efficent?
Seems a fitting coin from a techonolgical perspective
