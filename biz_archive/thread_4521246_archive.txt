hey biz.
i turned 25 and i am thinking it is time to become level headed all round so coming to the topic of the threadwhat do i do to be financially smart?
i don't want to be a wagie crying while rushing to my work .
neither do i want to be a business runner like dad and employ undeserving cunts at work and stress in my head.
is there a third path?
note: it should be continuously payingand i shouldn't appear like an unemployed cunt
