What's up /biz/raelis?Chad here, I got 3 chinks to do my coding and shit.
They're some math whizzes who won national math competitions in china and shit.
We're trying to make it big in Crypto.
What should we know what we're getting ourselves in?Where can I get the most detailed record for cryptocurrency rates/prices over the past few years?Any other advice?
How do I keep my chinks in line and make sure they work good?P.S.
