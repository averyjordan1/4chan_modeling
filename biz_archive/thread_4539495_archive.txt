I want to cash out some BTCI withdraw around 500$ BTC a few months ago though A BTC ATM but now I can know to do that because there isn't any close to my location...How you can withdraw around 500$ BTC online in the EU With low fees?
I just bought a new laptop via giftcards from gyft.
Worked pretty well.
