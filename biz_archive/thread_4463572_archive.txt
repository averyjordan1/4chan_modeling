I've been trying to use Google Sheets to create my own crypto called Sheetcoin.Pros: Zero transaction fees.Free wallet (a row of the sheet).Cons:Need a Google account.Admin (me) could in theory change anything anytime.Thoughts?
Comments?
Suggestions?
Nice, just altered my wallet to 100k
Literal shitcoin
Users would be given 100K at the start.Hence the name
You were one letter, just one goddamn letter away from an ebin coin for the ages.
And you fucked it right up.
Holy shit, I can't wait until the revolution takes all OPs out and has them shot
Submit to tradesatoshithey have all pajeet sheetcoins available on the market
But the joke is:Shitcoin -> SheetcoinBecause its on Google Sheets?
The coin is only tradable on the sheet its impossible to put in an exchange
only will buy if you ask for 32 mil and solve oracle problem.
If you do make Sheetcoin, make sure to give me some to test it
I already made it.It's functional but still in development.I do need testers.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FhroCBEFtbCrYfHyDZraYaaV1MxyPFEjA1DjM8wSCZk/edit?usp=sharing
I'll be a tester, my email is frerfjojkak@gmail.com
I don't need Gmails just fill out the form linked in the sheet.As you are the 3rd person to join you'll start with 3 million
*2 million
I see your row as a test I'll use the form to send you 10000 sheetcoins then try sending 5000 back to row 2?
