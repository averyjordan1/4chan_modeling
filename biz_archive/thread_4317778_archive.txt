What the fuck is going on with bitcoin Cash?Should we invest or is this s Pump and dump?
buy the dip dumbass
*siton my face baby*
it's bithumb and dump
Well OP, would you say there is a 4 - 1 chance BCH simply assumes king BTCs previous ATH?
In my opinion there are coins with more favorable odds.
It's a pump and dump, but it'll pump one more time to go out with a bang.
BCH = risk incarnatedalso it already found its top for eternity
