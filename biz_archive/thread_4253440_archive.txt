Oh I am :)
No fuck off nigger
I bought this bullshit at 0.8, please buy my bags.I don't want to support this german cuck coin anymore.
idiot
Every alt went up today brainlet
Nothing changed.
We will never forget about the refugee shit.
Most didn't climb anywhere near as high as IOTA bruh.
Sorry you missed out.
ethereum significantly more liberal/socialist than IOTA>people don't care outside of racist /biz/Any other FUD attempts?
Your decentralized broken tech shitcoin will never overtake btc.
Screencap this
It's fine if you want to invest solely in ERC20 tokens.IOTA is for the big boys who want to ascent past traditional blockchain.
DAG is superior in every way.
You'll be wojacking soon.
>>IOTA#p r o s: *zero transaction fees*tangle = no blockchain to download*minimal POW*back up: the seed is enough, accessing balance easily from every trusted computer*more transactions and network spam makes the network stronger (Infinitely scalable)*Instant transactions*No centralized mining pools*Micro transactions & other small transactions*Already partnered with Bosch & many other companies who have all agreed to use Iota specifically.
*dev team seems to be diligent and industrious (and yes they are humans and humans have emotions)*open source (the coordinator is not open, but it will be deactivated, when there is enough transaction traffic)*the supposed "iota-bug" by Neha Narula (MIT) was intended misinformation and market manipulation(Narula’s team provided no new information to the IOTA team.
Security of the IOTA signature scheme relies on one-wayness of the hash function which was not broken, despite of the attempts to do so.
Members of Neha Narula’s team have a vested interest in multiple projects that are in direct competition with IOTA; more infos https://medium.com/@mistywind/iota-cofounder-sergey-ivancheglo-aka-come-from-beyonds-responses-to-the-ongoing-fud-about-so-ea3afd51a79b )#c o n s:*still in development: to receive a transaction you must "attach the tangle" in the software and yes it needs minutes till hours(after wallet update last time it took 32 tangle-attachings!
)*There is a coordinator protecting the network*The developers can be a little mean sometimes#conclusion: hold 10 years
Raiblocks already does everything iota promises to do but better.
No wasteful pow
Not really a FUD attempt, a fact that this IOTA dev accepts a white race purge.
Vitalik is just an autist, you cannot take his words for real.
Vitalik is a strong never-Trumper alt-left anti-American socialist/communist.The IOTA foundation don't give a fuck about any particular race, they aren't singling white people out at all.
That's just typical FUD from haters.
I love people defending Raiblocks, it's largely entertaining.Have you tried using that shitcoin, hmm anon?
Yeah it's an awful experience.
Awful marketing (XRB / RaiBlocks might be the worst branding in crypto).
One man team.
The PoW serves a purpose on IOTA, the fact you think it's a gimmick shows you haven't investigated the project at all
