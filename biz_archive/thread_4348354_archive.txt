kek at that pic
Moon moon moon
are you okay pajeet?
well, the ufr bag is heaviest right now, really bringing my chin down but i think i should be ok seeing as how hst and dcorp bag weight will balance it out, just going to have to do some neck exercises
Why the long face?
buy ETHBET
BAH HA HA HA ha ha...Seriously, that's fucked up though.
I got into UFR in the ICO and bailed at 4x 'cos I'm a coward but I think it has the kind of bright future that will have me kicking myself for a decade to come
Check out the depth chart and transaction list for OMG.
I just picked some up for an easy 20% flip.
I did the same earlier today with ERC20 for a 25% gain.
Currently all in on HST with a .00089 average, except for my little gamble on OMG.
yeah ufr just got slapped onto etherdelta with proper ticker so pretty under radar, a file sharing platform where one is compensated for seeding files, supply getting burned nov 19, this bitch aint even on cmc yet.
safe x2 in my eyes currently trading at 0.000725 eth and supply is 13.something mill after burn.
do the math pancake tits
hmmm, uve seen my bags up there bro i got none else to spare but i might start eating away athst gains if something nice comes up,
whats the word on ethbet?
how is HST a bag?
Did you but at .0014 or something?
Just hold it until EOM or when it goes on a bigger exchange for 2x profits.
Patience.
nah lol i just call em bags cuz they could turn to bags real quick, preparing myself for the worst ya feel.
but lowkey im quite aware that they are money bags
DRPMy maaaan.
I think next month is going to be an enjoyable time for us
HST is a very promising project with not a lot of buy in yet.
2019 is the year of the HST
