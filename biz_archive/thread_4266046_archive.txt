Shameless bump , faggots.
What do you think of this project?
I've been watching FLO for the past month and it seems to hold steady support at 8 cents.
I'll probably throw $1k at it, can't be any more of a fuck-up than buying into PTOY...
Been holding since 5 cents.
I've seen a huge increase in terms of their telegram chat members and general awareness, but never seen it talked about on /biz/
I tried using Alexandria but I having to pay somebody a few cents to listen to their shit song turned me away immediately
Yeah, not the biggest fan of Alexandria either, but as I saw in the Telegram chat, they are going to have a huge update soonish (forgot the date) and going to seriously update UI and functionality.
They are also working together with them in an office and also with a project called Florizer or something.Pic related
