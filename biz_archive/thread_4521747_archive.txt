Anyone else thinking this pattern looks weird af?
BUY NOW, ITS GOING TO KEEP GOING UP FOREVER.
THIS IS EUPHORIC.
shoo shoo fud
its the screaming pepe pattern
Dude I'm balls deep in and enjoying this run since $300, I've just never seen a pattern like this
here's my simple-mind-probably-retarded-normie think:BTC has 16.7 million circulating at ~$8200ETH has 95.5 million circulating at ~$40095.5/16.7 = 5.71$400 x 5.71 = $2287>therefore $2287 is the absolute max ETH could possibly be right now.The midpoint between this and current price is(400+2287)/2 = $1343.71this is where i realistically see ETH, summer 2018the midpoint between that and now is $871this is what I see ETH getting to spring 2018midpoint again is $635that is what I see end of year.Now take all these numbers and give a +/- $50 rangeTLDR:>$585-685 - Dec 31st>$821-921 - Spring 2018>$1293-1393 - Summer 2018
another 50% increase for eth within a monthi'm skeptical
did some TA
The pattern you should be looking at is the fact that it is now a massive triple top.
When are you selling?
I just built up my portfolio to it's former glory, I don't want to lose again :(
it's been a long time coming - doesn't seem too unrealistic honestly
That's a meme
That kind of language worries me.
For months now eth has seemed to be like another ltc, a "stable" store of value for crypto.What reason would justify a 50% pump?
I remember hearing about Metropolis hype, is that it?
Nice, looking good
Thanks eth, made up my neo losses
ETH futures by mid 2018 have been announced a few days ago.
There's tremendous institutional money who wants to invest in cryptocurrencies but can't yet, because the market is too small to accomodate their presence.
It's common for large hedge funds to only commit to dozen millions or even hundred millions deals.
Knowing financial vehicles are on the way, you can bet every smartass in Wall Street is buying ETH with his own money right now.
buy the next dip boys
majority of eth trade volume in last 24 hours is from Korea
You're literally retarded
How do you tell the location of buy orders?
Are you just guessing that?
only coin with a future at this pointBTC has been FUD'd into hell

yep, lot of epic hacks incoming
just watched a 1200 ETH sell wall get demolished on kraken
Majority of ETH trade volume in general is always from Korea.
Check historical data.A raise in price anywhere in large enough volume for the given exchange can trigger a global rally through arbitrage bots.
4522222Thanks.
I didnt realize that tab was on there.
Then they will dump for sure at some point - that is their MO.
4522245I really didn't think we would be at this price for this long.
I was expecting a dip back down quicker.
Maybe we can get legs here what yall think?
its fucking midnight there toogooks love to gamble
ICO’s holding bags of tens of thousands of ETH are about to have an absolute fucking field day
I dumped 100 of my ETH coins at $400, will buy back in at $350 tomorrow.
4522227Out of top 10 markets:ETH/KRW = 23.46%ETH/USD = 17.89%ETH/BTC = 17.62%ETH/EUR = 2.16%Top Ten Combined = 61.13% of market11-20:ETH/USD 7.72% ETH/KRW 1.07%tldr: its a slim majority, also korea isn't china
Oh yeah I sold at 412, will buy the dip again
4522315smart dudes right here
I'm excited to see ETH is going to do, but rn bitcoin is going to make you more money.
Because of all the upcoming developments, I don't think it's going to dip the same way ETH has.
Over the course of this year, there have been 2 other times where ETH hit $400 and dipped back down.
Definitely bullish long term but its probably better if your trading.
For holding, I think bitcoin is better.
People are selling their August bags
NOT EVEN BLACK FRIDAY CAN STOP ETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I told you guys, asian dont buy BTC anymore BTC always moon when asian sleeping
Litecoin is the coin to be in right now, it's going to ~$85-$90 in this wave.
go for a quick fap>realise actress also does youtube>watch videos whilst fapping>return to original video to conclude faphr has passed>missed the prime ETH selling opportunityFucking hate my life.
Looks like the party still goes on, fapping gave you iron hands
actressneed a sauce on that
Im dumping 60 eth just to spite you.
its a holiday weekend though.
They're all closed.
never been hacked (ethereum can't say same lel)>has defeated 3 forks and dozens of China bans>derivatives markets about to take off which will bring in institutional investors and more stable prices>sitting at all time high above $8,000 after all thisyep RIP bitcoin's future
greedy people never take days off
Why not do 60% instead of 50%... why not do 10% instead of 50%?
Why not do -40% instead of 50%???
You’re making huge assumptions
