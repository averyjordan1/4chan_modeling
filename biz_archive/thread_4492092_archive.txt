Is this a good website?
het is geweldig
No.You work with Cfd's so you don't actually own any assets.Prices for crypto regularly trail the real prices by a few percentBid/ask spread tends to be very highAll trading on the site is leverage and you don't even get to choose.
You're forced to borrow money (at interest) even if you have enough to 100% cover your positions.
Gambling.
Better put your money on crypto.
Been there, lost lots of money.
Never again.
I've used the before (not on crypto), desu I think they're ok, it is a leveraging platform like any other you just have to be careful
