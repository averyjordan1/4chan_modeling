Worth investing ?
moonshot.
good upside.
but nobody knows it.I got some hoping it will pick up at end of the year or after listing
Not sure about this one.
I got some as a Rialto holder and just converted it to more XRL.It's basically just an index tracking fund for Crypto right?
I guess if you want go long and hold but let someone else micro manage the holdings to maximise profit, then sure?
I bought some a week ago
