Hello Friends,I have been meaning to write an article on this but I don't have time.
There are lots of bad signs with Moirai.
It "looks good" only on the surface level.
I am avoiding calling it an outright scam simply because I don't have enough evidence.
I will say that it looks really bad and there are lots of bad signs.Your Friend,RoosterRed

What's the cap?
It's a scam, don't buy into it.
The cap is one of the warning sigs.
The numbers don't add up between what the ICO is raising, the size of the team, and the projections on revenue from the project (which seem to be made up out of air).
I'll only call something a scam if I am sure, but it certainly looks very, very suspicious.
Most people wouldn't be able to spot the problems either.
Everything about it is suspicious.
They fake events that they'll attend, advisors denying having worked or contacted Moirai, and sponsoring articles.
Just be very careful.

I was going off their whitepaper.
You could drive multiple trucks through holes in their whitepaper.
