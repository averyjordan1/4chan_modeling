Segwit went from 150 to 360 after the news
Pumpers & Dumpers acting like vultures trying to squeeze the remaning of people's retirement fund.
its because they are still forking that was some hilarious volatility over nothingi mean this is still going to be a giant shitshow but wow how about some angry gamblers lelhttps://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-segwit2x/2017-November/000689.html
You can stop with the still forking scam.
It was over before it started.
Stop trying to scam people in to buying your futures bags, Faggot.

I'm tense from 5 days of defending Bitcoin Core.
It's over, we won, but they wont stop.
The still have S2X futures bags they need to dump on someone before it goes to zero.
42589074259050people still dont know non summer jack is a post op
i honestly thought they were going to zero too until now.
the market's irrational, you can try stuff but it's hard to make a real difference unless you appeal to emotion...people are dumb.
i've traded in hitbtc IOUs before but i always flip them before delivery because they always pumped hardcore (low liquidity?)
if they had any hype.
perfect example was DELTA going 10x as an IOU but then never even going above ico out of the gate.
hitbtc "futures" are a joke, their UI is full of bugs, fees for dust orders are questionable, and token withdrawal fees are high.
they even list bitconnect now.
it's not a great exchange.
if anything i would assume the price of a possible forked coin would be the difference between futures and swap on BitMEX
well obviously not zero there were plenty of buy orders at $1 :^)hitbtc is notorious for thin books
