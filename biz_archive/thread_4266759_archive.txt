Guys I think this is it.
The biggest ETH moon that we have been waiting for since June.
We are going to $1000.ALL ABOARD THE SPACE ROCKET!
Sorry brother, since you made this thread the resistance already started the downtrend.
See you at 300
looks like it was a pause to take profits.
the run upwards continues.
Small technical problem.
Vitalik is tweaking the engine!
I took profits twice already.
Trend switched downwards.
Get out for now, $331 is the new ceiling to break.
Quantic Boost engaged.
Fucking dumb idiots that trade everyday would've made way more just holding btc eth and ltc for the last 6 months
What if the parity bug is preventing ICO eth from being liquidated?
you clearly don't understand how ethereum (and most crypto) works.
the majority of ethereum isn't stored in parity.
it affects trust more than anything
enjoy living in fear and ignorance, fgt
We've experienced 10% growth boys, does that mean the ICO money has finally stopped dumping?
Are we on track for nice natural growth now?
There's not much money left in ICO wallets, there's a link around somewhere but most have cashed out already
