>people buying at 6299 when there's a legit 2k btc well wall at 6300Do they like risk so much ?
Are they stupid ?
Why not wait for the breakout and buy at 6320 instead of risking it all.Also what happened this night to make btc go up 10% in a few hours ?
Is the crash canceled ?
They don't know about walls.
>What happened this night
>sell wall>legit
wallsthey are put there to manipulate retail traders who think walls mean anything
maybe they just want to go eat their dinner and don't give a shit about the next 90 minutes of fluctuations
serious idiot here, what are walls?
a rare currency found only in china and mexico
Sell wall will stop the coin from going up.
Buy wall will bring the coin to the moon.On shitcoins some of these walls can be faked so be careful with this general rule I gave you.
