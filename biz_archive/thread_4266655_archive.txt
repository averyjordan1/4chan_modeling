I make around $5k a month.
A year ago I started investing and trading into crypto as a hobby.
Since money wasn't really an issue I was (still am) pretty casual about crypto investing here and there.Now I'm at a point where I have 15-20 different coins most of which are rising significantly.
It's very hard for me to keep up with the prices of each coin.
I'm pretty much lost, everything is scattered in 3-4 different exchanges, micromanaging this shit is giving me headache.Any suggestions?
Hold folio nigga or write down your transactions you lazy faggot
What is Blockfolio
Blockfolio.
Sell and buy limits if you aren't planning on just holding.
15-20 different coinsI seriously hope you're not holding more than 1 or 2% in each of them shits
I'd say on average he's 5% in one each coin
