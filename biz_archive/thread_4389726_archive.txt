Okay /biz/tards I need to go to fucking sleep.
I have 2k worth of ameridollars sitting on bittrex right now in BTC.
What do I hodl until morning.
Fiat?
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
BCH.
Set a sell order for 1400 and enjoy your comfy $600 profit tomorrow.
True?
Try $1300 instead.
I don't see resistance anywhere near $1400.
Scared to put my entire portfolio into a falling coin.
Seems really stupid lol
You're right.
You should buy high.
It's still high.
This shit is going to 500-600.
Lisk, it's making crazy movement and wouldnt be surprised if it hit its ATH tonight.
Litecoin.
It has already started but you're not too late.
The only answer is BTC.
Do your trades when you are awake so you don't get JUST'd in your sleep.
ETH no doubttomorrow trade that ETH for BTC
