Is DNT gonna be todays PnD?
i hope.
bought this morning and so far i am in the red.
It's not really moving up anymore ...
it's already dumping kek
Why did you buy?
Just because it is being pumped?
No because I bought in and im cursed.
Everytime I buy low it keeps going lower
yes.
it honestly looks like a shitty idea and a shitty coin.
i was just hoping to make some money back i lost investing in other shitty scam coins.
So you invested in another shitty scam coin
Volume is too low.
The market points to POWR.
It shot from like #23 to the seventh highest in the world in market volume in the whole crypto world.
That's not something to be ignored.
POWR is a great long term hodl, and with that volume, I could see it closing in on $38 like NEO - in which case, I will literally be in fucken lamboland.
you're a retard
