Do u guys listen to the .flacs?
Also get some nice akg cans with an amplifyer.
This thread is now about Boards of Canada.
How the hell has it aged so well?
Still sounds ahead of its time even after all these years.
OP when I trade I exclusively listen to aphex twin selected ambient works 85-92.

All of my BoC albums are on flac, my dude.
