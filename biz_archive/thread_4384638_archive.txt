With the BCH/BTC fiasco pretty much over, what should I be daytrading /biz/?
I want some things with high volatility.I'd like to work my way into traditional stocks too but not sure where to start.
I'd like an exchange I can fund with crypto.
If it was over then bch would plummet.
Idk about your question, but buy micron stock.
Guaranteed 40% over next year.
