How many Monero owners are also invested in XMR lite?
Delete this asshole.
Biz doesn't need to know.
Yesterday they told me that there's no reason to exist, miners are on XMR, in the deep weeb they want XMR, the original project is XMR.But when I see people wasting their money on shitty privacy coin I wonder why they don't buy AEON instead.Anyway now it's a huge uptrend and it's way overbought, would buy below 30k sats.
Sumokoin is better.
Trust me.Fork of XMR.
Thanks for the tip, but if i'm going niche then I'd prefer to stick with the same dev
