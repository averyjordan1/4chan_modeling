Fuck me!
Have you seen this?
How BTC will handle that?https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

Sooner or later, maybe two days.
The influx of spam was already stopped with the latest Bitcoin Core update, everything is going back to normal.Are shills really getting this desperate?Sane people, please listen: Jihan was literally talking about an obvious exploit that BTC has due to it's limited block size, when making the case for BCH.
This was it.
The exploit is gone now.
They mempool so bloated it even killed google maps
Nigger, this same shit went down around BCH fork.
BTC will correct back to 5k, Alts will dip slightly.
ETH will goto $750, XMR to $500 and LTC to $150.Any non-scam alt will follow suit and we’ll stabilize at new highs.A good time to be in crypto my friend so long as you’re well diversified.
One day reward halvings will make it no longer profitable to mine empty blocks and people like Jihan Wu won't be able to play smug games like:https://twitter.com/jihanwu/status/704476839566135298?lang=en
How many eth xmr and ltc do yo you own
its the chinksthis is a war
BTC won't handle those transactions, Bitcoin Cash will.
