On binance, why do some of the open orders have parts of them filled in with colour, what does this mean?
it's the amount visualized silly
what does that mean?
Pretty sure it's just outlining the orders with the highest volume.
... What would otherwise appear as a buy or sell wall on a depth chart.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, I just started trading on binance yesterday.
It's okay, too early in the morning to be a dick.
The greater the fill on the bar, the larger the purchase/sell size in relativity to the volume.
it seems so simple now.
Thankyou friendo.
you got it.
Good luck out there fellow anon.
hope to have a seat next to you at Dorsia sometime in future lamboland.
Look for the one with the Australian flag painted on the side and cunt written all over every window.
FUCK OFF WE'RE FULL
