Can someone explain how chainlink will scale regarding to the amount of transactions ?
It uses ethereum so it will never reach the amount of transactions per second that for example visa/mastercard can reach right?
Until Plasma is implemented but who the fuck knows when that will happen if it does
Won't it have its own network when it's up and running?
chainlink is the most theoretical idea right now with so many flaws and scenarios that need to be considered that I wouldn't waste my time trying to think of them all if I were you.
if only coinye had been allowed to happen.
imagine the marketcap
so its a shitcoin?
jesus christ man I know this sounds like a cliche, but would you just please, please, do the most rudimentary research before posting this shit.
ChainLink will be blockchain agnostic, which means no, it will not be limited to eth tx times.
