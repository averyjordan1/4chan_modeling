I have 1.5 BTC and 18 BCH.
I don't know what to do.
Did Ver even start selling yet?
The guy is smart so he's obviously not going to dump it all at once.
I feel like this is the tipping point.
If I make the right choice I will make it.
So, dump BCH?
Dump the remaining BTC?
Do nothing?
dump both shitcoins>buy cheap alts???
If after all these years, when BTC dipped to 5k your first instinct wasn't IMMEDIATELY to go balls deep in BTC, you're never gonna make it cause you haven't learned the only golden rule of crypto:Always buy the BTC dip.
No exceptions.
Actually, it looks like Ver's transaction isn't confirmed yet.

Dump BCH before it's too late and you get fucked in the ass
Dump the Cash or I'll annex you Finnshit.
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
New DAA tomorrow.
I'd wait to see what the miners do.Quite a substantial share of the community and miners are cut about 2X failing.If today demonstrated anything, it demonstrated that the 1MB blocksize is ridiculous.
bitcoincash is a lie.
better sell them sooner than later.
Invest in btc and alts they are very cheap atm.
Something like 60% on btc rest eth and chainlink.
Mongol pride ftw
I sold some.
Now hodling more BTC than I had before the happenings and on top of that 10 BCH.
Whatever happens, at least I will not lose.
