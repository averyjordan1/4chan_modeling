>I want money so fucking bad !
Same... unlike all my friends with good jobs that live it home rent and bills free...
I make 70k and pay extremely expensive rent for a one bedroom and have to spend 400 a month just to commute to my job... why even live when you can't save and everyone else passes you buy with opportunities to invest :(
spend 400 a month just to commute to my jobwhat the fuck anon
Car payments, insurance, and gas, most likely.
New York City prices for commuting and then I have to take a bus to the train which is 60 bucks a month.
Rent is 1600 a month.....
Nope.
Literally just the train and bus... if I take the subway in the city instead of walking it's an additional $3.50/ride.
I also own a car so gas for driving 90 miles to visit family adds up too
Money is a sign of poverty.Money only has use in a scaricty economy, so someone owning it betrays the fact that they live in a pre-abundance society.
It's the reason why air doesn't have any value.In the future people will consider Bill Gates to be poor.
Yeah but a lot of things will always be scarce, like ur faggot ass.
No U

Money doesn't matter, power is the only important thing, money usually means power but not always.
