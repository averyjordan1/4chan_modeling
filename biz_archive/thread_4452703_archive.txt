It would be nice if I made it into crypto, but if not, at least the banks will go bankrupt.
Which is nice.
You mean the banks that print money that you change for your shitty btc?
Crypto is the next best thing to gold.
Fiat is a scam.
I mean the banks that will go extinct because cryptos become the new fiat.
Also, I see you in every thread.
Depends how the crypto is done.
I don't see ppl carry gold bars around.
The gold standard just limits the supply.
After banks go to shit the public will neither able to use paper nor metals (maybe silver if there's enough.)
They will naturally start using crypto because it's practical.
One thing I'm sure of it that the public will not take another 2008 and if the bankers make their own crypto then it will be rejected.
appreciate the update lad
