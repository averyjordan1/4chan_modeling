Biz, I use Coinbase.
Yeah yeah I know, kill myself.
What can I use to buy alt coins?
I signed up for Bitfinex but then they said US players no more.. HELP.
This girl isn't Asian
Binance and Bittrex.Also who is that?
Poloniex.com or just get a gpu and mine shit coins, this way they are untraceable
I agree polo :)
Make sure you buy eth.
Thats a lot cheaper and faster to send to an alt exchange than btc.
Then you can convert to btc.
But bittrex and Binance already have many eth trading pairs so you might not even have to exchange to btc at all
Thanks everyone!
Use binance, polo is shit
Use LTC for funding/holding.
Stable in price and always one of the cheapest and fastest to send.Binance is among the best right now.
Don't use Kraken.
Be careful with Poloniex and Bittrex.For the most options there is Cryptopia but another place to be wary of, wouldn't keep much stored on there.
It's mostly shitcoins anyway.
