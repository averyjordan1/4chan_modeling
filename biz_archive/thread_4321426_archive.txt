Who else /OMG/ here?I bought at the .00115 Cap yesterday.
Is it gonna keep going down?Thinking about cutting my losses.
Does the fact that I am making a /biz/ thread cement the fact that I am in too deep?

I agree, OmiseGO.......at once I thought it was a bad investment.
Dubs say it goes parabolic.
I guess?
I want money!!!
I want money noWW!
!1 I dont wanna wait!!!
If Omise has some type of release before Christmas it'll be nuts.
Guess I'm a bag holder now.
wallet api will be out soon.
they are already expanding their polish team as the whitepaper said.
Never gonna make it.
Go play with Legos you weak handed bitch.
OMG is my biggest alt investment.
Shit's great.
Unfortunately we're currently in a period of shit because of BCH.
Just HODL.
It'll go ballistic this coming year.

Whale here.
Im gonna give you a few protips for the short term.1) dont buy alts, theyre gonna keep bleeding until either btc or bcc wins which wont be decided this year.2) bcc has been pumping daily for the last 3 days.
Yesterday's pump was a test, the big one is coming tonight, which is why certain individual moved tens of thousands of btc to a few exchanges, target is .5, so dont fuck that up.3) chinks will take the hash power off btc slowly but surely, too many big players are backing bcc while core is in disarray.
4) ling longs are very likely to endorse bcc and resume trading, they hate core because they dont control it, this will get us to .75 and its happening by end of month.5) when btc is rendered unusable by spam transaction and miner attacks, bcc will get the bitcoin ticker in most exchanges (Q1 2018).
This is the end game.Im on my phone about to ride a plane with someone you probably have heard of so i wont be replying a lot.tl;dr get in bcc today.
