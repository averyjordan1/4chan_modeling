Should I hold onto this disappointing shitcoin or just dump and hold BTC?
dump this worthless shit
CEO is fat so that means it's a shitcoin
buy ATH, sell ATL, buy ATH, rinse and repeat.
Why are you even asking?
Do as you wish reallyBut dont post pink wojaks if/when link moons
Why do you think it will moon?
I bought this at 30 cents, made some profit, lost it all.
All it does is drop and the developer is an aspie who doesn't care to communicate.
It might moon if they decide to ever to any PR whatsoever, but this guy is a marketing autist.
BTC hitting 80K is only a 10X and requires more than 1T market cap.Link going 10X puts it at what 600M MCAP?
If you are looking for vert small gains over a long period of time - yea.If you are looking for big, fast gains then get Chancoin.
