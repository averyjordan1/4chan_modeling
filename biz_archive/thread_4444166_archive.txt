I would like to humbly pose a few dumb questions to you experienced financial experts.
How do you stay organized trading crypto?
It feels like for every new coin I hear about I have to sign up for another exchange.
Is there an exchange with more options than the rest?
Also is there one wallet I should be using?
There is so much shilling and fudding going on around me I'm just hoping someone can give me an honest answer as to what services are best to use.
1. dont trade more than 5 coins.
you can ignore the shitcoins and pick from the top 10-15 coins by marketcap2.
use a charting platform like tradingview.
exchange charts are shit.
your human pattern recognition skills are better than any supercomputer, and you will develop a million-dollar intuition by working with charts that can be customized however you want3.
find your "experts".
look on trading forums for people who seem really good at trading your coins.
copy their trades when they make calls you agree with.
putting trust in an "expert helps you avoid panicking like you would with one of your own predictions, and helps you hold until youre at a profit.
shitcoins is where the gains are
Thanks just bought 100k
