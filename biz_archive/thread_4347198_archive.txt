Just this once.

They have new technology coming out called TPOS that will allow you to stake other peoples' coins, without having to worry about staking it on a web platform.
Yep you read it right.
You'll be able to stake your coins without having to worry about the platform being hacked.
It is a GAME CHANGER.POSW is poised to be a money machine.
The Dev team is the real deal.
They do not fuck around in chat.
They are 100% serious business.
They just came out with the new website yesterday and it looks awesome.
They havent even started marketing yet.
Rebrand is on the table so we can silence the "Piece of shit wallet!"
parrots.
Then there are the dividend bonuses (called RSB's) and the democratic voting system coming out, there are so many things in the works for this project.
It's going to be on the front page of CMC guaranteed come Q1 2018.POSW *will* go berserk.
