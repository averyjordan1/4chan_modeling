It's 2020Rankins are wrong tho
fuck tether holds steady over 2 years, why is it always so flat?
surely it's a meme coin at this point.
whats the point if no gains?
>No link Yea no
Sued and rekt kek
I still remember in the facebook group you guys snuck in the fucking DGB, that was some next level shit!
bro I've been accumulating trying to pump this shit but the sell wall at $1 just won't go down
Thx for adding coss op, good moveEos will be much higher though
Wat.
...... Stop triggering me
coss only $2it will be $100 by then
2020 at LEAST half of those will be gonethe ONLY sure bets are BTC, ETH, XMR, XRP and maybe LTC
I wouldn't be so sure about XMR, ZEC may dominate it.
I agree that most will be gone and there will be some that are now not even top 100 atm
Those crazy eth prices only possible with LINK
Rankings are about right.
LINK is a meme so I'm glad it's not on this list.
