WTC alpha is behind schedule.
They've done nothing but fork existing code and used find & replace.
how do you know
I just read about this too.
pretty disappointing
The chain is Ethereum.
They're using My Ether Wallet.
It's still an ERC20 token.
seriously who the fuck still holds walton.Their biggest moon mission announcement --> genesis + wallet has been delayed.Their real marketcap is already around 800 millInvesting in walton is just dead money, do yourself a favour and buy into real moon missions like request
I can confirm.
Dumped 30k this morning.
I should have sold earlier.
You're right about them only counting 25% of the tokens towards the cap.
Just got out.
Sick of this chink coin.
Finished tomorrow, alpha test was a success next step , live demo of Rfid and chain in action in the next week or so, December , public beta test of the chain.

http://www.waltonchain.org/notice-detail?id=000000005f6de19c015f827b9a510001 Road map is at bottom, No official statement has been made about the alpha's success until tomorrow most likely but the slack and community alpha testers have repeatedly stated that they have not encountered any bugs and that things were "solid" despite WTC having requested no info to be divulged.
If failure had been encountered it would have leaked by now.
Expect either a tweet or a formal update on the site in the next 24 hours.
