its been a long fucking time since /biz sucked that good bitcoin dick, im starting to miss the fucking link threads, are you pajeets literally trying to manipulate 130bn with fucking /biz shills?
you do know this board has no actual fucking money right?
what the fuck is going on?
This board has much much more influence than you may think Anon
This board at least have half billion.
literal pajeet coin pumps i get, you see them continue to fester on pajeet level cuckfolios so the correlation could be there and low vol caps of crypto can easily be moved by a few bag hodlers.
how much could we really be of that 10bn volume though?
i guess we just need to be covered in the broader campaign.
to be fair quality of shilling was higher this week, it's been fun.
it's not the amount of money that matters.
it's meme magic
you do know this board has no actual fucking money right?/biz/ raised $2 million worth in Ark for the biz staking pool in under 6 days.
where are the Linkiesis that shitcoin still around> its all priced inkek
/biz/ definitely have at least 1 billion.
There are some huge whales who come here.
Most of the people who claim to be whales are fakes and larpers though.Wouldn't be surprised if Jihan, Roger Ver and maybe even charlie low-key browser biz once in a while.
Even Vita1337 maybe because he's a young dude.
definitely this.
Just jihan and ver means that this board have at least 3 billion at a bare minimum.
shilling to jihan and ver seems like an even greater waste of energy
it's all subconscious.
ver already shifted his btc for bch so apparently this actually works to an extent.
Vitalik is definitely here sometimes.He even had pepe in a presentation.But unlikely he trades much.
Yes definitely this.Would be so epic if in a couple of years this becomes a 10 billion+ board.Will happen, Kek wills it
i'd love to see this, not by way of 100 billion pajeet shills though
combined wealth of neetvill is around $10000$15 per capita this place is a fucking joke
