I just sent a few thousand LINK from my wallet on Binance to my wallet on COSS.Made sure to check the deposit address multiple times before making the transaction.
I made the transaction.
It processed, and Binance shows that it completed.
But none of the LINK has shown up in my COSS wallet, not even as a pending deposit.
What the fuck is going on and is this normal?
You fucked up.
Your LINKs are in the limbo right now.Might call the bitcoin Support Hotline for advice, not this pajeet board
Proof or this is FUD.
You know you can literally track transactions on the blockchain explorer, right?
Finally arrived.
Holy shit that was terrifying.
Took 489 block confirmations and two hours *after* Binance said the deposit was confirmed.
Fuck.
it's almost like its because they store everything cold.
and it's almost like it's mentioned in their whitepaper and multiple other places.
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT SAYS IT DIRECTLY ON THE DEPOSIT WINDOW
