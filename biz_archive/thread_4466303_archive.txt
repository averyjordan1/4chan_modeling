Hoping coin with eclipse picture to moon lol, honestly this coin just jinx itself to the price hell
I'll just hodl this bastard.
The losses aren't tragic and I have other coins that make me money so it's fine for now.
When will it hit other exchanges?
It just hit KuCoin recently.
Cryptopia and HitBTC coming later this month I believe.
livecoin - 22nd of novembercryptopia - end of novemberthis trashcoin will never moon and im gonna be bagholding for years
when will it hit real exchanges?
4466628This  is more correct.
It was Livecoin and not HitBTC I was thinking of.
Nobody knows, so probably never.I'm just hoping since it's an Aussie project, the Aussies on Cryptopia will hype it up and buy my bags.
why doesn't it fucking moooooooooooooooooooooon
so will u dump your bags when it hits crypropia
Maybe.
I don't have a large amount (~4k HST), and I've actually started to really like the project.I'll probably sell at least half if it pumps when it gets on Cryptopia.
NOOOO!
This was supposed to mooon!
