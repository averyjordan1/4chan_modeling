Just liquidated all my alts into btc.
Feels dangrous atm
You just bought a ticket to a sinking ship, anon.
You might get out alive but there's no refunds.
holy shit, risky.
But when bch crashes you will have mayor profit.
How much money are we talking about?
I'm HODLing 0,6 BTC(eurofag).
and 2,5 ETH.
If I didn't already HODL BTC I would have gone on ETH when it dipped two days ago.
Plus you just sold alts when they all took a big bleeding, If BTC doesn't moon you will regret your decisions.
you sir are a fucking idiot, thats all i have to say in this matter.
Buy BCH
WHY DOES BITTREX CALL IT BCC!!!
people will by pass the transactions using eth then flow it back into btc.
Yea guy I probably wouldnâ€™t have done that
but why?
if btc goes up so will altsif it goes down some alts woudn't
