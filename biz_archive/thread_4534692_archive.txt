> he fucking sold REQ a day before the big updatePic from last update.Stay tuned for product/API release, as well as partnership announcements in the coming months.
Last chance to buy in low.
It'll dump back to sub .05 cents before it starts to pump
This.
But we all know this request team doesnt do "announcements".
They will subtly drop the exciting news in their dev update.
I am expecting some huge news on colossus and some potential partnerships.
They gave us a sneak peek of it in the last dev update, this week they might just give us the whole damn thing.And with partnerships I am sure they have sat in the same room as reddit, airbnb and ING negotiating potential partnerships.
buy the rumor sell the news nerds, it's already dumping
We pumping again boys.
Get strapped in for the colossus pump
