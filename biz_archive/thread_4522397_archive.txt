So what was that jump about last night?
People shouldn't be worried about whatever Link is doing, it is the most guaranteed profit I've ever seen.
Now what I've been up watching is ODN because that's a shitcoin I'm in too deep on and I don't know where it's gonna go.
Dead cat bounceAlso some whale using bots and keeping the price at 15 cents and not letting it go below that.
Every fucking month does the same.
I know because I check the price everyday.
I'm not buying til it hits 8 cents.
Rory saying news before EOY.
Which is normal because I sold my whole stack off at 1800 around an hour or so before that was posted.
So GG no Re.
My discord group pumped and dumped it, we picked LINK because it could easily be shilled on /biz/ due to all the bag holders here
PnD it was quite easy to spot.
It was a whale using bots.
Whenever the price gets around 15 cents bag holdered get antcy so the pump was intentional.
>pumped to 17 cents>still 17 centshow is it a PnD?
they pumpyou dump
It is still above 2K says so idk what dump you guys are on about

How the fuck did I miss this one?/biz/ whats the next realistic 3x?
bag holders trying to keep it in the top100 and above ICO price by coordinated mcdonalds paycheck dumping into the shitcoin
Don't sell it at once, damn it, we need multiple pumps
