Hi - Mod here from the unofficial Telegram group; REQ has unfortunately rode straight into a perfect storm of headwinds since ICO (0.0002 ETH);1, Agitated Whales (limited holdings) and novice ICO participants who disappointingly were in for 'flips';2, Binance SNAFU with dual issuing3, Multiple BTC forks and market consolidation back to BTC; and,4, The discovery of Binance hot wallet bags (Still trying to rectify from the listing mistakeThis was identified, and REQ bagholders (myself being one) began to 'let the bot sell to us' to divest the holdings.
This has triggered some more awareness in the TA community, hence an acceleration.Once the exchange wallet is diluted sufficiently - I have expectation of prices ascension far beyond ICO price
In terms of ETH, it's not.But it's still way above ICO price in terms of USD now.
It'll get there.
Can you elaborate on the Binance wallet issue?
