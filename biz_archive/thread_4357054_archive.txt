POWR dropping hard on bittrex.
Saw it drop from .00089 ether to .00084 within seconds.
Sold it immediately O_O
tfw bought at the high again (0.0005100)How do I do the opposite of what I do.
thats hardly a drop...seriously?
This is a Teeka Pajeet PnD.
Careful with hyped shitcoins
maplestory!
It actually dropped 0.000052 to 0.000043
dont worry anon i have been holding since ~800 sats and I sold a bunch right at the start of the pump then bought back in at ATH, i fucked up and lost so many tokens>mfw
I essentially fat fingered because of a mistake and yeah... ATH.
I hope the ride isn't over and this thing's gonna moon because otherwise I'm going to be very pink wojack.
