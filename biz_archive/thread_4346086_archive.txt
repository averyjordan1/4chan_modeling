Why are people saying this BCH shit means crypto is dead?
It doesn't mean crypto is dead but it does mean that it's really is easy to set up scams.
BCH is basically creating billions of dollars out of thin air and nobody seemed to question it's existence despite the fact that the fork was supported by a negligible percentage of the network.
Bitcoin has public awareness now and this shit can set public involvement in crypto back much further than something like Mt Gox.
