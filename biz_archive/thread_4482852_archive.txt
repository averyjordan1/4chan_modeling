What actually happened with Confido to cause it to go to zero?
This poor guy thought Confido would get its shit together, and it actually dipped to 8 cents shortly after he posted this, so he could've at least 2x'd if he got lucky and bought it at the bare bottom to flip a quick 2x.
Exit scam
Dumped my ICO bags for 15 ETH, not as much as I could've got but I'm happy with it.
I've also learned to not get greedy with taking profits
