EVERYTHING YOU SAY TO MEEEEEEE
TAKES ME ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE EDGE >AND I'M ABOUT TO BREAK
Once in a blue moon, one of you anons makes posts about Ethbet, and when I see it, I get butterflies and a big smile on my face.
I told you guys it was shit.
I NEEED A LITTLE ROAM TO BREAHTHHH
ERRRRRYTHING YOU SEY TO MEEEEEEEEH
I still believe it will go up
I STILL BELIEVE
I'm fine with it, have $400 in right now.
I put $40 into the ICO, sold at that pump a month or so back, then bought the dip almost at the exact bottom, sold again recently and just got back in.
I think it will 2x from here once some dev sightings increase, and if it actually does what it says, could be 10x from here and it would still be an utter shitcoin.
Also like 20 percent possibly its a scam, but high risk, high reward
