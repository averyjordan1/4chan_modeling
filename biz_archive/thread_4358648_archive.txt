JUST IN FROM THE POWR AMA:>"Do you plan on answering or addressing the Elon Musk / Tesla romours?
">"It has been many times, just rumours.
There were inital talks but thats all we have to announce.
"Devs have confirmed that they have been in talks in the past, get ready to load up 2 days before Palm Beach if you know what's good.
I must see a fucking sticker on a fucking skateboard.
I see that this shit has been out for like a day only.
Is it worth to put some shit in this and hope it goes up?
thinking that Elon Musk will not simply create his own crypto
lol they already dumbing this sht right now
when is that btw?
AMA was a couple hours ago.Read the whitepaper and read around the web and tell me that this is not the most promising coin out there.I know that le real life use has been a solid meme, but this shit is the definition of real life use.
Not only does it have real life use, but with one of their co-founders as acting Lord Mayor of Perth, it's reasonable that she could have the connections to begin implementing it in Perth soon.A lot of people in America, Europe etc.
downplay it's real-world uses because their energy economy is much less cucked than ours here in Australia.
Here, if you have solar panels, your excess energy is sold back to the power company at a rate of something laughable like 7c per kWh (in AUD, so like 4-5c in USD)
no I mean the palm beach release
what about hostcoin?i think hostcoin is a scam though, but the concept is cute
I am unironically all in on this but for the long haul not a quick 2x.
POWR will be one of the few tokens/coins remaining in a few years with real world use.
lmao, already dumpingI'll consider buying in once it's below ico
