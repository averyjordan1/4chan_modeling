found this:Obsidian Relaunch Date is 4th December 2017 *** New improved White Paper *** New Website *** New Design *** A wealth of new content *** The Power is YoursWhat does that mean?
Starting all over?
It's all the stuff from the Tamico partnership happening.
Not really unexpected... just progress.
ok
It's not a complete restart.
They're rebranding some old content + releasing new info.
It's good news considering their current website is nerdy as fuck.
My last day
it's the day i become a millionaire *-*
Ready for another antshares/neo moon?Laughing at the retards missing out.
it means more than you can imagine
He thinks a copy of a whatsapp messenger with recycled code from VisualCrypt will come within 1% of the ride NEO had.Let me hand you this noose.
tfw holding 5k obsidians bought at 13k satoshis @_@
lol u can suck my butthole when I'm rich af
but anonymous is really useful...when you're not sure something is legal or on parties...I like that :-)
>tfw bought 40k odn during ico and didnt sell at 90 cents
tfw bought at 20k sat and sold under 3k sats but now this grows
Lol that's where I rebought at too after selling most of my ICO stack at like 16000 sats.
Totally thought that was the floor.
Held onto that bitch until like 6000 sats or something before giving up on it.I rebought about 4000 ODN at about 3000 sats though so it's all good, this shit BETTER hit $1 by New Year's
He doesn't realize that ODN cant do file sharing, calling, and will release a MVP of the already basic messenger in Dec.>He threw more than $1,000 USD on a coin with known scam artists>He didn't look at the sea of shitcoins past rank 200 who have the same exact pump and dump graphDeluded fake millionaires.
When will they learn
do u want it extra crusty so u can have a nice snack while sucking my butthole
The delusion is getting to his head >Severe finanical losses accumulating everyday weeks no working blockexplorer>fired only guy working on blockexplorer>puppet being jerked around by strings from dev team>buys the dip that keeps on dippingObsidian - Buy the dip that keeps on dipping 2017
I think ODN is handy for sharing porn anon
Oh I see now.
You want me to diarrhea in your mouth.
Oh look it's the same guy that feels the need to spam 20 FUD comments in every ODN thread
Somehow manages to actually get released months late and make it to the app store months go buy and apple store says 53 downloads are attributed% of app downloads from Mumbai, India% accidental downloads through ads>Earns staking rewards equivalent to $5>Meanwhile other alts are on biggest bull run since 2017>makes 1.2% gain as most alts are up 300%>muh privacy
bought at 20k sats and lost thousands of dollars>can't get over itlol
I sold most at 2000-3000...should I buy back now?
Or wait after till 4th (sell the nesw)?
He bough at any sat level>Time weighted return/opportunity cost for other moons = -90% as ODN moves sideways>his thought process: at least I can sext my grandma with privacy
he literally lost more money on this coin than anyone in this thread>he spends all day FUDing the coin because he is an in real life pink wojakLOL.
I know who you are from slack.
you are the biggest butt hurt loser :^)
Who do you think it is?
I don't get why someone would spend so much time on a project they hate.
Just move on lmao
he doesn't care about the price anymore>he just wants a nice gummy from grandma >he googles guummy on urban dictionary
stay mad faggot :^).
some day you'll make up the fortune you lost by FOMOing into this coin.
LOL.
maybe.
Sold my bags at 8k sats>They said I was stupid for selling that low>checked price and it is 4k sats now>made 250% return on bcashtop fucking kek
aw now he's making up a story to try to save face.
that's not what you told us on slack you little faggot :^)
congrats on making $100
arguing with an anon on a cantonese waifu decentralized image messaging board>holds enough ODN to not be able to sell for at least a year>doubles down because he has no choice and is being held hostage by his shitty investment>Digimarine in the making
kek.
He's so obviously butthurt about making a terrible trade.
Busted the salty loser.
he literally bought at the ATH and sold around 3k sats.
this is what he said in slack.
I know it's him because he used the same images, lmao.
who is it?
He thinks I held more than 10k odn>Meanwhile no working block explorer>no new exchange in a month>fired 3 employees in 3 weeks>main engineer can't even speak english
look he's so triggered he can't respond properly anymore, lmao
Owning ODN but having less than 10kHAHA I knew you were poor.
Bought 10k odn at 8.5k sats>Saw it wasnt doing shit after 2 weeks so I sold at 8k sats when it pumped back up briefly>Saw it dipped to 2.5k-3.5k satsKek.
U sure u aren't the poor one?
All these ODN marines are even more sadder than the deluded linkies.At least LINK seems to have a potential in 2018, meanwhile ODN...Cut your loss and move on bois.
Ever heard of opportunity cost?
Didnt think it was possible to be more deluded than linkies.
And to think some people out there threw 10s of thousands of dollars on this shitcoin messenger app when the appstore is filled with second hand messenger apps that are never used
Coins with real potential moon within the first month or two and get more exchange exposure.
theres a reason why coinexchange and hitbtc are filled with deadcoins that you have never heard of.Stay strong deluded ODN marines
WillyT probably
