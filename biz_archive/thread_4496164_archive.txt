Whatâ€™s Bitcoins biggest competitor in the long run and why is it Ethereum?
send .00000001 btc>get charged .01 btc in fees>wait hours for confirmation>be me>hold and USE ETH>send 10 ETH> receiver gets it within 20 seconds>pay .01 cent in tx fees
sending USD 0.00008You SHOULD pay a fee that prevents you from clogging the network with a tx worth so little.
buttcoin will die.
it will be a happy day once we rid ourselves of such a shitty, ancient currency.

You should pay a fee for being such a gigantic faggot.

0.00008 cents>thousandths of a cent
he was obviously exaggerating but there are plenty of "nanotransaction" use cases that are completely out of the question until real scaling is actually implemented (<-keyword)but it's ok because bitcoin is a store of value and you aren't supposed to transact on the chain though kek
desu bitcoin's biggest competitor has always been itself.
However, it only gets in its own way with all of the politics that are causing its development to stagnate.
If Bitcoin loses the #1 spot, the Bitcoin community only has themselves to blame.
My only point is that they shouldn't be surprised if people don't want to use their hashing power to process infinitesimal tx's.
It is the free market after all
