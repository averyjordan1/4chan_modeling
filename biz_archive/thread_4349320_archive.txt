Really cant decide if should buy GNT or XRP for short term....someone might help me?
bch
If you're going short term get into BCH
Look at rlc op.
Perfect time to buy in
neither unless you're retarded.buy some HST or some ED gem that will 2-3x overnight.
CFD NIO etc.
HST is still low tho
I hope all the people recommending BCH dont try to fool me...i am already near broke #dontbecruel
it’s like a crypto musical chairs.
When the music stops- that is, Brass is released, you want GNT, which will go astro.
XRP might hiccup a bit when something something Japanese banks something something IBM.
But it’s all bullshit.
Personally I have 100k™ GNT.
There's a lot of support for bch.
This is 100% certain.
However what is uncertain is if it will flip BTC or be equal to it.If you want short term not that risky good yield gains, go bchif you want long term slow but sure gains, go bch too.If you want short term high risk high reward gains, don't buy btc/bch/eth/ltc and the popular ones.
XRP is a long hold, if you're looking for a short term don't go into it
all theses bch shills how much are you paid?
Short term godlike.
XRP is a long term hold.
If you are looking for a two year solid moon then XRP is what you want.
If you're looking for a short term 50/50 go somewhere else.
