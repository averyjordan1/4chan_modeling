I like how I have given this company $1,120 in fees with my buying/trading but it's taking 4 days for them to get back to me with a simple question....better then coinbase which is taking over 3 months to get back to meSomeone please make an exchange by the people for the people, you would make so much fucking money, my question to bitstamp was to see if I can up my buy per month limit, literally asking if I can give them more money in fees basically.
