That doesn't sound great...It does sound great though, look where zuck is at today.

This is badass.
I love popcorn shit like this in Crypto.

Unfortunately there's something sketchy , the team doing the accusing is from Slovania and there seems to be questions about them in general now (not saying Slovania is good or bad either).
Surprised more people aren't talking about this when shilling POWR
it's Slovenia and there's absolutely nothing fishy about them, one of the people in the team was my college professor at masters comp sci and he knows his shit and they have regular community updates
If you look past the marketing and headlines you'll see that Power Ledger is full of shit.
All smoke and mirrors ppl
yep, my money in on SNC, it's below ICO right now
