Hey, /biz/.
I am interested in learning day-trading and hold $2,500 ready to invest in a growth-oriented strategy.
In other words, I seek to balance between steady gains and a well-defined risk pool.
I do not wish to gamble too much starting out, and I heard penny stocks are a good way to develop some experience.What would you recommend to someone with no experience in day-trading and investing, but is eager to learn?
BUY ASTRO YOU FUCK
Second opinions?
day trading by definition is on the extreme end of high risk high reward.
don't put in what you aren't willing to lose.
Day trading is for boomers with boomer friends in the right places to tip them off.
The rest of it is merely there to draw in more fertilizer for them to grind up
What are stable long term options instead, with a healthy degree of risk-reward?
What is a good ration to invest in BTC and ETH?
S&P averages ~9% over the long term (decades) but fluctuates wildlyUS bonds are a guaranteed 2.3% for a 10 year commitment.everything else is a sliding scale trade off between those
Fuck off assholes.
Honestly open a demo account with a broker.
Get used to a platform.
Make consistent trades then think about opening a live account.
A lot of money can be made doing stocks, forex etc.
You need to have experience like a normal job.
Except unlike a job if you learn everything right overtime you can actually become a millionaire unlike all these fuckin normies that dont see the big picture.
