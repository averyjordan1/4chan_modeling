Hey /biz/I'm new and looking for a secure platform for trading crypto and energy (either one actually work because you can make money from both in Europe)I need a platform where i can start with low amounts of money and keep investing the money i gain.I'm thankful for any kind of tips but I'm pretty sure in what I want to invest in but i need a platform that allows small deposits and broad markets (if it's not too much to ask)
literally any shitcoin exchange.what do you mean by "trading energy" ?
You could rent out hashpower when you have cheap electricity / mining equipment
What I mean is renewable energy, even though I'm not a trading pro I would like to invest in solar and nuclear (solar parks and SMR) because a lot of the upcoming election are about "muh renewable energies and a lot of money is being pumped into these projects and trying to convince consumers that you need to get solar (even though they only supply 5-10% of your energy consumption)I think that it's the future in the step to go from fossil fuels to renewables so I would like to put money into the future of energy consumerism
