Regardless of the outcome tonight I will never hold BTC.
If you want to hold a coin where the devs think 150k unconfirmed transactions is "not a problem" and $10 fees are "features" you go ahead and do that.
I think no matter what happens fear was struck into the heart of all BTC hodlers today.
They realized they aren't untouchable and their coin indeed sucks.
Are you making money from being emotional?
No?
The exact opposite.
I am investing based on solid economic and technological fundamentals.
Bitcoin core will never lead you to the promise land with their shit tech.
BTC will be overthrown and I won't be on the bus when it crashes.
You have fun with that though.

4315639are you guys really shills or just people to dumb to understand what bitcoin is?
BTC will not be dethroned by a chink coin!
Most people investing in BTC only care that it's value goes up.
Everything else is magic to them.
They won't believe you even if you explain to them what the problem is.
