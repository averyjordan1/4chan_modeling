Hey /biz/ im currently making about 25/hr doing blue collar work but it is dangerous and hard, id like to not do it forever.
so im looking to pad my resume/income with some finance related jobs/certifications that i can pursue when im not working my main M-F 7-330.Im ok with spending money on getting/maintaining state/fed certifications if you think i can make a few bucks a year for it to pay for itself.I dont have a college degree i know that rules out some jobs automagically.
some jobs i have been investigating:tax preparerbail bond agentreal estate agentreal estate brokerinsurance agentinsurance brokerstock brokermortgage brokernotary publicloan officerenrolled agentloan originatorbounty hunter
bump
why don't you just forge the certificates?
