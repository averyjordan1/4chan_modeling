Get in.Now.BTC is now owned in majority by investment funds, hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions.They will keep a cycle of pumping and dumping going indefinitely, until an inevitable collapse.In December 2017 Goldman Sachs will start offering FUTURES on BTC assets.This will cause the bubble to pop.You will get burned.Also no transaction fees with BCH lol.
