Alright I got tired of being Justed so I liquidated and will now start over.
Back to Trading the minute charts 16 hours a day now
I know how hard it is living like that but I made way more cash than now currently holding.
Next year I'm going to commit 10 months to day trading to make my millions.
We all going to make it!
