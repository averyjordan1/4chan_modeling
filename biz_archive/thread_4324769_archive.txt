Whale here.
Will give a couple tips cause I'm done riding the BCC/BTC train for now.1.
Buy all alts at these low prices that you believe in.
For me, I'm stocking up on REQ as my biggest hold; will probably soar past $100m cap eoy because of the main net site launch.
2.
If you're not buying alts, slowly start to sell out of your BCC positions that you're in.
BTC is nearing the buy-in mark of $5000-54000.
Whales that are riding the BCC train will sell off and start buying BTC back.
If you thought a flippening would actually happen, you're braindead.
This was an orchestrated pump and dump by certain miners.Stay safe and don't get caught at the top of the BCC peak.
are rlc and salt ok to sit in?
i must glean your knowlege
