It JUST'd me hard.
Good thing I wasn't too deep into it.
But daaaaaamn!
disappointed in this one.
it is one of the most normie friendly cryptos out thereor you could play 4d chess and accumulate some more now expecting it to go back up atleast to 7$
It's actually weird, Vault is a great wallet.Marshall is a cool dude...I heard they've been betrayed by an advisor that sold his stock causing it to fall while they was releasing the Alpha.They will sponsor the Richard Branson tennis private tournaments at the end of November, hope it will rise a little, to decently cut the losses.But even when other coins tank, MTL tanks twice, it really hurts.
That's what you get for selling millions worth of tokens for 0.15$ in a private "ico".
thisit's another jewish scam
I just saw it at .00065 sats and I thought, "since it's not dropping the support must be really strong, it's also what neo and omg did, aka the sing of the good coin"too funny lel
