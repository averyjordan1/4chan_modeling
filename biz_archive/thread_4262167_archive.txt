Just simply buying BTC and holding it would be a much better for you since it went from 4000 to 7000 top, but instead you kept chasing moons
Put it all in NULS and thank me tomorrow
what did u buy?
What’s nuls?
First bought LTC around $60 that fucking halved.
Then I got around 800 wtc but thought Link would be better.
Next morning Link halved as well.
Oh ffs...

It’s quite easy really OP.1.
Don’t buy shitcoins.2.
Hold 3.4.
Profit
Copy pasted from another person's post in a previous thread: NULS: It takes a lot of disparate connecting for a westerner to put it together it seems, but from what I have gathered they provide customizable backends in the form of side chains to chinese enterprise.
There are aspects of neo in that it can be a platform, aspects of walton, as they provide supply chain logistics, and aspects of ven as they provide an anticounterfeiting protocol.
All of those features are already present in their parent chain.Partnered with inchain already.They have some kind of deal with a huge chinese payroll and accounting firm.Literally has risen since my last post substantially
See 1.
All in on MOD ...
Why????
You've heard of link and omg I guess... Hummm.
Then I got around 800 wtc but thought Link would be better.Jesus christ.
If you just held that walton till next month/January you'd be so much better off.Patience cunt.
