lol confirmed shitcoinNow I know for sure it's going to hell just like LINK
thisI liked REQ until I saw this
What's so bad about being in contact with LINK?Oracles are something that have to be implemented sooner or later.
Unless something more promising than LINK comes by, why wouldn't this be good for REQ?
They lose credibility by being associated to a scamcoin that they say they have regular contact with.

Request is a moon coin, the interest was so big that I was selling registered email addresses, just the prospect of investing in request, people were paying for it 0.3 ETH, a lot of them dump during th ICO's crisis but now everyone will be like... daaamn I should have kept Req and will jump back in
t. Bitcoin holding cuck
They're trolling, anon.
They're whales that want to accumulate LINK at cheaper prices so they FUD it here all day, don't make their wishes come true, don't sell them your LINKs.
Does that mean REQ will drop 50% today?
