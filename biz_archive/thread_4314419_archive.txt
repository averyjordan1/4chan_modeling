BTC value is falling too fast, if I want to sell my BCH for fiat is the best method to trade BCH for Tether and then use their website or is there a better method to avoid converting to BTC altogether
You generally want cash out to fiat in an exchange that's in your country.
I'm in the United States.
I luckily exchanged my BCH for BTC JUST before the crash because I got impatient fucking with Tether registration.
Best method for converting BTC to USD?
Ive never done it before.
What happened?
It was riding high at 7,000 and not it's back down to 5,555.
You missed alot.
BCH about flipped with BTC but BCH just crashed.
BTC is back up to 6000 because of BCH crash now
but in their site they tell to your face they don't owe you dollars in exchange of tethers.
like literally they say tethers are worth nothing
Im not looking to store for long term or even minutes I want to cash out now.
Use coinbase.
Tether is based in Taiwan.
I rember
dude sell for cash if you want to cash out wtf is wrong with you?
