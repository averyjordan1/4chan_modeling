I WENT ALL IN ETH AT 0.0488 BTC NOW IT'S ALREADY DOWN 10% AND BTC IS MOONING FUCK ALL YOU PEOPLE
no... fuck tether scammers
get on my level fag>down 15% on ETH>down 20% on NEOall in a single day, good times
Honestly I'm thinking about just going all in on BTC and wait it out.I'm sick of hearing everyone say it's a bubble about to pop only to wake up to a new ATH every day while my bags get heavier and heavier
I'm thinking about going all in on BCH
shut up idiot...this is the last btc dead cat bounce before it takes a big dip to under 5k....be patient.
How the hell y'all loose money??
My Eth went from 230-250.
-355 ***
if ETH breaks 0.038 (possible) its going to 0.025-21 ....people are deluded by the USD price and ignoring the btc ratio price.BTC is headed to 10k...thats another 2k (who knows how high it'll go)
Have patience
I can't.
Crypto drives me mad.All I do is look at charts all day and I start panicking as soon as any investment goes down.Maybe I should stop...
Don't
they still think in btcdeluded af
