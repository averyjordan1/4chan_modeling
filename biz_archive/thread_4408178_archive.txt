Since Vitalik is a closet pedo, would it be better to buy Etherum Classic?
It looks like it could go up but could be a PND coin
It's legit.
Find a good entry point which I think would be now.
It's not going below 17 usd.
Ethereum Classic is the same thing as Ethereum except it doesn't have the EF behind it, oh and it doesn't have that blacklist for contracts that Vitalik pinkie swears he wont abuse.
How much do you have Anon?
How high are we expecting it go?
Oh right now?
0.
And I have no idea since I'm not part of any pnd group or anything.
I'm just saying that this coin usually dances between high 17 and 20.
Also it's a good coin to drop a small amount of btc st it and go to sleep.
At least that's how I deal with it.
