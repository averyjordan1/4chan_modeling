Everytime I check BCH is slightly more profitable to mine than BTC but only ever has 10% or less of the hashpower.Anyone have a theory as to why miners are mining at a loss (besides the flippening).
I personally think the flippening attempt could be happening but I am curious to hear any valid reasons why they might mine at a loss besides that.
there's no reason other than to make the next btc difficulty adjustment as high impossible to ensure a chain death spiral on the next bch pump

>mine bch>dump bch>repeat
bro i own 37 BCH and 0 BTCIm actually asking because im considering doing a substantial margin long on BCH or short on BTC (ontop of my BCH holdings)also if this happens my other altcoins probably gonna get fucked, considering selling them at a loss to all in BCH
Profitability is a meme for ADD kids.Mining bitcoin is always more actually profitable since only bitcoin will reach one million jewpaper per coin, the more of them you mine, the wealthier you'll be.Spouting retardation like profitability of mining is as retarded as buying at the ATH and selling at the dip.
I thought most miners dont speculate and instead immediately sell for fiatI know McAfee does this with his mining pool for instance
BTC difficulty is dropping 30% in a few days, this retarded theory is simply not happening right now.Additionally BCH's new algo ensures BCH only stays profitable for a little bit before the difficulty jumps way up, as little as 1-2 days.
Most miners are chinks, so most miners are retards YOLOing hand-to-mouth yeah.The nip farm is going to be a huge breath of fresh air.
BTC difficulty is dropping 30% in a few dayimagine how low it would've been if they hadn't mined at a loss.I said make the next adjustment as high as possible, not make the next adjustment positive>Additionally BCH's new algo ensures BCH only stays profitable for a little bit before the difficulty jumps way up, as little as 1-2 days.the new edas only objective is to maintain 10min blocks regardless of hashpower on the bch chain
