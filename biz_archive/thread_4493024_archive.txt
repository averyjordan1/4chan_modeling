DOVU is the hidden gem right now.We all know industry partners matter these days; we fucking hate investing in random coins with just website and whitepaper.DOVU is the only one on this list to actually receive funding from someone (Jaguar).https://crunchbase.com/search/principals/00a32f29479d0b930cbf508690ec0126a83f996cJust LOL if you don't think this coin will be on Binance soon.Easiest 20x of my life.You can even check Etherdelta...all the sells are pussies selling 1 ETH, while there are many large buys sprinkled throughout.Your move.
Dovu has zero blockchain devs.
They've raised the ICO money and are now going to go try and hire.
They are years away from doing anything.
They've got an idea, and your money.
That's it.
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesguest/You know how VCs work, right?Your salary depends on the performance of who you invest in.You think some Harvard MBA would risk his career on a bad move?
OH MY GOD THEY'VE TAKEN A GRAPHIC DESIGNER AND MADE HIM HEAD OF BLOCKCHAIN DEVELOPMENT!!!!
YOUR GOING TO BE SO FUCKING RICH!!!
!VC's invest in lots of things, it's seed capital.
They expect most projects to fail.
You think a Harvard MBA means they're going to make it?
!You know their industry partnership is just that they are in an incubator with Jaguar money in it?
Good job, those reduced rate desks will certainly take you to the fucking moon
