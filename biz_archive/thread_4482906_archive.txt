Why should I hold anything but BTC if BTC will never dip because whenever there is a dip we can just print tethers?
Whereas with other coins you will just CONSTANTLY lose against btc growth?
And I know what you're about to say "when this tetherbullshit goes down it's going down hard.
"guess what fag, if BTC crashes the entire alt market is going down tooLet's look at the situations1: Tether situation never crashes1.
You hold BTC.
BTC grows.2.
You hold alts.

You hold BTC.
You lose 90% of your portfolio2.
You hold alts.
You lost 90% of your portfolio

the average /biz/ trader is going to be BTFO by normies holding on coinbase
What are you trying to say exactly, that we should keep printing tethers because it keeps the prices up?
It's all ok as long as everyone's making "money" off it?
