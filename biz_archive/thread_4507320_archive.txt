At my wagecuck job getting told to smile and greet when i just made more in 30 minutes trading crypto before work today than I will in my 8 hour work day.
When will it end
If you are so smart why the fuck are you still working /sJust because you made $100 today doesn't mean you can quit your wagecucking... by the way... why is it called this?
Is this as sjw term to somehow describe what is necessary for a modern economy to thrive?
If we did not work how would shit get done?
Let me guess, you did not pay a dime for your first car (if you even have bought one).
Not trying to make fun of you but you seem like a whiny cunt.
Also, did you quit school or think you did not need to get good grades?
What is your job /age?
We need more posts like this instead of faggots supporting the "lol wagecuck" memes.

This board makes me sick sometimes.
I see so many "ohhh my horrible life" and "ohhh I haven't doubled my money in 3 days" and "I have to actually work to generate money to pay for place to live so I am not robbing people because I am a poor crackhead" comments to make me puke.
The majority of "rich" people worked their asses off when the other people partied or watched fucking tv all night.
Don't believe the socialist bullshit how all rich people just got it because their family gave it to them....
of course, you need to work your ass off to get to that point.
the difference is the poor is spending all their money on shit like partying and so on and the rich is investing it.
Bingo, I wonder what type of useless bullshit OP has bought in the last 6 months...
I can almost guarantee he has bought more than $3000 worth of overpriced stupid shit.
