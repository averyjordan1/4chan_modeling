>bitcoin goes up>alts die>bitcoin coins down>alts diehmmm...
Sick and tired of this shit.
I was wondering this exact same thing just now.
I can understand why when bitcoin goes up, alt coins go down, but why do they go down when bitcoin goes up?
Don't most crypto traders keep their money in some form of coin?
If everyone is dumping all types of coin, where is their money going?
It's all going straight to Bitcoin Cash.
What's with the sudden increase in bitcoin cash?
Isn't it a shitcoin with low security?
4285985Were you guys not around yesterday?
It's bitcoin with better security, better economic incentives for participating parties and better scaling.
Why do you faggots keep saying this?
Alts only go down when BTC does if people cash out for fiat.
A lot of us are up this past week.
You must be buying some proper shitcoins mate.
