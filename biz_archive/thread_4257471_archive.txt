Well, fork was cancelled... Will we see Vertcoin push back up to its' ATH over the next 12-24 hours?
Solid volume going on and it has just dipped.
Should be some immediate gains at least.
tldr I wanna fuck a vertcoin fml
I'm going to buy in if it's down when I wake up tomorrow, it feels a bit high to be buying in now.
I'd definitely be holding if I was already in though.
