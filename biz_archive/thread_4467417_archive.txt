What do you guys think about Quantstamp?
Did any1 get in at the crowdsaleThey seem to have solid dev team and public interest is high.Also, do any1 know where the tokens will be traded and when?
Yeah the utility for their tokens is amazing
quantstamp, app development cost less than 1 mill, they fucking raising 30 mil.
do your calc stay away from it.
Yea Quantstamp has a good idea, plus they want to eventually infuse it in ETH.
I live in a banned country, so I could not get it in.
Go figure there headquarters are in the same country
S H I T C O INThis.
Also anyone who bought enjoy the 50% discount people got.You dodged a bullet.
was in the presale tier 2 phase.
Still didnt invest.
Their shilling was a bit too much for me.
Maybe its gonna be good for a quick pump and dump like confido was.
Dont wanna risk it though
This will be REQ all over again.
Pepare to get STAMP'd if you buy this piece of shit
Only that REQ has an upside potential, not like this shit ICO with zero token utility, but let's get REQt together
STAY away or you'll get STAMP'd out with the rest of the comfydo crew.
Its a fucking token for auditing god damn smart contracts with presale faggots that got 100% bonus and requires proof-of-shillIf you buy this at ICO price you deserve to get Confido'd
No one got fully 100%, your investment would be split into the different discount tiers
