Mfw when I bought CND on ED at $.020, no big exchange has listed this coin yet.
Anons what do you think is the market potential of hybrid intelligence product?
I am scared this is a too niche area for people to get interested in.
It's pumping right now for some reason.
But it's a scam coin.
The app would work fine with fiat.
So why would you need a token for it?
Exchange is coming soon, that's why
Another exchange will just lower the price.
It's obviously being kept high from whale manipulation.
This coin has crazy swings.
I made some money day trading it.
If it hits another exchange it will go below a penny.
here is new updatehttps://medium.com/@Cindicator/cindicator-product-release-cryptometer-2-0-bot-766e460a9df8still no real exchange though.
They have a working product now.
One out of many.The arbitrage bot.
You need 1 Million CNDs in your wallet to use it.To purchase the services.
Or holding to use the service.
Why are you saying "it's pumping"?
I see it still stable at 200 sats
The arbitrage bot.
You need 1 Million CNDs in your wallet to use it.Why not just charge money for it?
Why do you need a token to have it?
It was up 8%
I'll tell u a secret anon > They are going to release a working product (web app) in December.
Along with that, will be a big listing on a too exchange.
If you want a nice Christmas present, HODL.
These AI /trading coins are gonna POP as soon as they become trendy.
Right now we are in an alternative Bitcoin/ low market cap ico trend.
The second AI gets hot (December - maybe February )then all these coins will do well.
Cindicator, Genesis vision...
The Cindicator nerds promised it would release/list in November, not December.
Official nerds are still saying November November November.
