Buy Powr.
When Tesla announces a partnership it will moon harder than any crypto has mooned before.The woman in my pic is Jemma Greene who is the Mayor of Perth, who is one of the founders of Power Ledger.
Perth is the capital of Western Australia.
She posted that message 2 months ago, well before the Power Ledger ICO.
There have been many updates with Musk since.Power Ledger is already partnered with Origin Energy, which is Australia's largest energy provider.The power Ledger functions with Elon's Tesla home battery, and links it to Origin's power network.... Do the math.You're looking at 30-35x.
If you buy $100 worth of POWR now you'll have $3500 in a month.
When Tesla announces a partnership Never gonna happen quit wishing it

The woman in my picWhich power ranger is she?
Sure a Tesla partnership would put us beyond the moon but this project is so solid it's an easy steady gain as it stands.
Sorry biz, I know you are jaded and you've been too busy adding to your pink wojak folder.
But Power Ledger is a solid project, they've received $8.25 million in funding from the Australian GOVERNMENT.
That's huge.They are revolutionizing renewable energy.It's a literal moon mission staring you right in the face.
It's not a pump and dump, and has seen steady, solid growth already.
