how does /biz/ advise their clients when a stock's price goes from 87 to 57 in 1 year?
HODL
if you have trust in the company's future I guess it's a good time to buyand when I say trust I mean trust in your research
Less people watching NFL = less pizzas ordered Sunday
Stop investing in obesity
Sell low?
> Buy the dip> Whales accumulating> Weak hands are dumping
4389051shoulda bought dominos
Kek pap johns about to go bankrupt.
Dont say I didnt warn you.
"Whales are just accumulating bro, it's gonna moon any day now"
Holy shit this.
Have you ordered Dominoâ€™s in the past couple years?
What a convenient experience.
4389089holy fuck anon, i thought dominos was literally fading into obscurity, but apparently they're killing itdoes this mean papa jons is nothing but the apple of the phone industry, while dominos is quietly the android?
fug should have boyught dominoes instead of Boeng
Thats hilarious.
I saw some papa john's "shilling the alt right" on /pol/ some weeks ago and thought it was legit marketing.
Guess I was right.
43890894389153god damn, Dominos is literally more than YUM (pizza hut, but also taco bell) and Papajons combined, little caesers is still private
Papa Johns is over, drop those bags.In fact the dip is because the NFL millionaires niggers chimping out cause been oppressed, and the cucks at Papa Johns reply on twitter that they will try to work with the niggers to pleace the SJW, and gave the finger to Neo Nazis.Well, Neo Nazis (aka Rednecks) are the ones that watch NFL and order that shitty pizza.And Papa Johns is not Apple or Amazon or Netflix that they have a product with less options to replace.Papa Johns is over, done, kaput.
it's a stock price matters more than market cap poster
check the market cap of each company you fucking moron.The nominal price of the stock literally means nothing.
Are people seriously this dense?
As an Italian, you really look like flies discussing about the best flavour of shit.
4389695where the fuck is this market cap bullshitshow mealso you're telling me that stock price now no longer matters?
4389635okay nvm found itPJ is at 2 bil, Dominos is at 20 billso what was the fucking point again?
Dominos is at 7 bn and YUM is 27bn.
Which negates your claim.
When I was a kid in the 90's and even in to the early 2000's I remember pizza Hut was so good!What happened?
Pizza Hut is disgusting.
Domino's is better.
Costco is better than domino's though.
I didn't really like papa Johns the two times I've had it.
YUM includes various entities, bottom line if you divide them up its lower than dominos too
WorstMoonEver
Buy high, sell low; I'd say it's time to sell.
Get off your high horse you cunt.t.

You put clients money into fucking fast food?
