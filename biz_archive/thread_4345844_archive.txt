Teeka just sent an email recommending Bitcoin Cash for short term.
Welcome to 5 hours ago retard

stop being a retard about buying giant market cap coins that teeka recommends, look at his last xrp call.
You definitely should trade on this because /biz/ is a never-ending stream of Palm Beach Confidential articles.
Stop being an idiot.
Teeka's short term trades take days or weeks.
Long term he means more than 6 months.
He is right about XRP, it will skyrocket soon.
Specially with all this Bitcoin scaling mess.
