so uh, what is the point of having a coin for this?
Can anyone pls explain
Any link fags care to enlighten me?
https://link.smartcontract.com/whitepaper
The point of having a coin for it is so that people on /biz/ can go broke more conveniently
You can google it if you are really interested
I have googled, and have read the white papers, just seems like there is no need for a coin, really should just be shares in a company
have read the white papersno you didn't.
it explains the need for a token
same as 99% of eth token projects, token is totally useless and just used for speculative trading and to give value to a start-up
to pump and dump dailyhttps://discord.gg/aFkBzRw
It does notExactly
ethereum tokens are the worst thing to ever happen to crypto
The point of the token is to give priority of data to nodes, without it you won't have priority to good data flows compared to people who do.
Meaning you're not trusted to carry that information of the 1-2 million dollar transactions.
It also pays node operators.
You clearly didn't read the whitepaper and seem to stupid to comprehend the technology.
Don't feed the tards.
