It's fascinating to follow how the battle for hashing power plays out.
Each side pumping their own coin and dumping the other.
I would give BCH the upper hand because the majority of hashing power is aligned with it and it can't be killed.
They didn't want this.
Death of Bitcoinâ„¢ will affect all cryptos.
bch just fell to 10 % tho
Just when it was going to be more profitable to mine BCH, BCH was dumped and BTC was pumped.
Now BCH DAA re-adjusts difficulty and BCH mining profitability starts to increase.
BCH DAA is still learning.
