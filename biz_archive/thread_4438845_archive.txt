Out of all the cities in burgerland which one do you think is underrated/would rather live in
Colorado springs is max comfy
what's it like living there?
None.
Living in Australia is living life on easy mode.
Why the fuck would I want to live in Burgerland when civil war 2.0 is about to kick off?
Not Boston or New York
Australiamy condolences
Its fucking terrible here what are you talking about

I live in Austin, Texas.
It is easily one of the best cities.
Nashville is very cheap, tech-saavy, a rising center for art, and has some of the best food you'll find in America.
People think it's just country music like 20 years ago.
It would shock you.
Wherever there are the most white people
Richmond, VA.beer, babes, burgers what else do you need plus it's got a badass river flowing right through it.
Hope my squad sees this
