Here’s what I don’t understand.I don’t hate the argument that BTC needs 2MB block size, makes some sense.But - there are a ton of coins that do the transactional job better than BTC already.Why do we need BCH again?
Because people love get rich quick schemes.
>Why do we need BCH again?We dont.
Its just the mining cartels that control a shit load of the circulating supply (that they got for free, mind you) doing what they do best.
we dontthis is the main reason you know its fundamentally bullshitbut my question is, youre on fucking biz.
why would you need to ask a question like this?
its being traded in a way where people can profit.
why wouldnt they try to profit?
stupid kid
Also all the exchanges that received countless bch and didnt hand any over to their customers
(that they got for free, mind you)what did he mean by this?
SO - can we best FUCK THEM and bring miners under our thumbs by just selling their pajeet coins and going all in on ALTS?
Only way to fuck miners is to champion an alt that doesn't use Proof of Work.
Proof of Stake or Proof of Space and Time in the future
OPs pic is untrue.
Sage.
THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT MATTER BECAUSE NOBODY IS USING THESE FUCKING THINGS
>Why do we need BCH again?Psst.... Bitcoin Diamond.
because it follow's Satoshi's whitepaper - P2P cash.not a Blockstream settlement layer with fee Sidechannels.that's why
Why do you need BTC.
It was intended to be cash but now you can‘t do anything with it.
People keep saying the industry is adopting BTC but nobody uses it.
Only paying buying because they want to sell for more USD later
Over 300,000 stores in japan accept btcJapan accounts for the majority of btc transactionsWhat can you do with bch?
Buy bitmain asics?
>mining cartels>bitcoin as a brand name
