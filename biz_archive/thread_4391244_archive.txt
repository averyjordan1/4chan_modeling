But then how do I sell BTC for USD on Bittrex or Polo?
I thought it was just a fake currency to store crypto at a USD value without getting fucked over by fees or transaction time?
yes
Seems very useful.
it is.
if you feel like BTC might crash, you can transfer to USDT instead of a meme coin, and either buy back in and continue on buy back in to BTC, ETH or LTC, quickly transfer it to coinbase or w.e and then withdraw it to actual USD or euros.the "scam" refers to the fact that you cant actually withdraw that USDT on the exchange sites.
and hypothetically if suddenly all the crypto in the world started dropping continuously, you could potentially be fucked until it was stable enough to cash out.
You can't its like a work around for us laws but it's so grey area legally it's gonna fall apart eventually.You can trade USD on Gemini or gdax but then every trade is taxable event, barf
The scam accusations aremore about the fact it's backed by shady bitfinex and they print more of it at random times and then pump btc with their fake money.
They claim it's all backed by real dollars but have no banking
4392626Damn, so what should I do then?
Withdraw it in NBT or SBD every time?
spend well pupper
if there was a bank run on crypto i dont think anyone at all has that kind of fiat.tether is fiat, quite literally, exactly the same
This guy gets it.
Tether is a great workaround and is helping everyone that is daytrading.
Even if you dont own any
