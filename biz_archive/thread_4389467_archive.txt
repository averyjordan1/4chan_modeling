Tell me something about this, /biz/.
Should I go all in?
No never go all in kek, put some money in though.It has partnerships with Draper Dragon, sponsored by Chandler Gu and rumoured to be listed on Binance this week.
Major potential in tech as well.
I'm looking to put at least 50% ($300) into something, and Metaverse looks like it might be it.
It isn't discussed here very much.
long term its a great hold but its going to be a nice slow lambo drive to 10x from here.
long positions will be rewarded but some people prefer to day trade the ups and downs and seek volatility
I don't know, ANON.
Do you have it in you?
That's why it pumped earlier, right?
Should it get listed on binance, will it get dumped or pumped further?
Hell no.
+5 If binance
Mate this is legitimately 10x if you're patient.
Binance is nothing.
It's not getting on Binance:https://www.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/7d5zdg/binance_to_list_metaverse_etp/

We have no plans to list etp in the near future.WTF.
This is omg tier shenanigans.
Tell them if they keep this shit up they will lose credibility in the long run.
Is this something asians have difficulty understanding?
It's the next pick of PBC.
long termThis is the next 10b coin
They are lying.
They accumulate first and after that they make millions by listing it
Who cares about binance.

Prob true Tbh.
