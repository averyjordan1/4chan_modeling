Any aussie anons out there using coin spot, is it legit ?
?,is there an easy way to get bitcoin over more than coin base aus cucked limit of 500 per week
Coinspot is okay, it's just not true trading platform and the fees are fairly high.
Good for beginners.
Try btcmarkets or in dependant reserve
can confirm coinspot is decent.
Instant bank transfers.
Btcmarkets also decent.
Use BTC Markets, you will usually get a better rate there as it is a proper trading platform.
you could try btcmarketsor coinjar.Coinspot is legit though.
Don't use cuckspot the fees are fucking ridiculous.
If you want to hold it's okay but if you want to trade just buy your btc or eth on btcmarkets and then move it to bittrex or binance
yeah just need it to hold some alts, and to purchase bitcoin to shift to bittrex.
is this standard or am i being an aboriginal
you need to request to get a higher limit on coinbase you cuck and they'll approve it depending on how much of a pajeet you are
Spot on, even buying to hold they can getfuked their rates and market price's blow
This plan works, and financially works out pretty even if you factor in the banking charges of going straight to bittrex.
Like it was said before it's a good cash to holding with many options.
Just't use it to flip coins.
Coinspots is 100% legit I would however play around with no more than $1000 unless you want to get cucked by $50-100 fees
BTCmarkets the only one not killing on fees
You can't move your tokens out of Coinspot, brom8.BTC Markets is the best for buying and selling BTC and ETH to AUD.CoinJar has the highest sell prices for BTC in AUD.
