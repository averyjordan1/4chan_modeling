Amid all of this hysteria, the reality of the situation is that last night, BTC dipped to 5.5k during the height of massive FOMO and panic buying into BCH.
People were terrified and panic selling BTC left and right, and at the height of that it only hit 5.5k .The BCH pump&dump is done, all of the big cats at the top have already taken their profits off the first dip, look at the fucking figures, its -19% already.
The pump is over and you BCH retards are just riding the dead bounces.
TL;DR we have seen the last of BTC at 5k.
Historic milestone achieved.
