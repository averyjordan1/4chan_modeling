Today's Confido situation served only to emphasize how great of a buy Link is.
With so many huge corporations breathing down his neck he HAS TO work his ass off and deliver a product or he's absolutely fucked for life.
Sergey has todamn
i might have to sell my honda civic to buy more LINK and a road bike
How is Sergey even involved in this?
He's got no technical or programming knowledge.How can he tackle a technical problem like this?You guys sure this isn't a scam?
I own 200k LINK.
Explain to me how a potential user of the chainlink network failing is a good thing?
Granted confido was a very small project, but still.
I don't see how this is "good."
