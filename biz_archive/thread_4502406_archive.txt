buy the rumor sell the news
you dont see pumps like these anymore ...btc just doesnt have what it takes....
 news is the death of BTC
BCH is a new baby though, it's got Chinese and Koreans going after it like a bitch, BTC is dead to them
This is pretty insane, how the fuck do you even trade with pumps this big?
find an exchange with low fees and flip
sold at .158. could've went a bit higher, but eh.
It's over for the moment, Korea already pulled out
Yeah thanks for that, I bought my BCH at ~$200-300.
Stop listening to those kikes at blockstream and retards like tone vays and /r/bitcoin
how do you know korea pulled out?
bithumb exchange
https:// cryptowat.ch/bithumb/bchkrwHow is that a pull out?
Already lost 2k $ on this shitcoin.
Not touching it anymore.
