So if BTC dies what happens to alts?
Does the satoshi price of them stay the same while BTC spirals down to 100$?
t. brainlet
something else takes over.
probably eth, since many exchanges already have eth pairs and such.
don't think that's happening soon though
Algo traders get rent, eth or usd takes dominance.
