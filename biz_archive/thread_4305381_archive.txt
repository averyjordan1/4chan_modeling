Thoughts on this guy?I have been watching Keiser Report off and on for half a decade now and I enjoy his alternative views on financeAlso, his rants are entertaining af
He was bullish about BTC years ago.
Made a lot of ppl rich.>He is insane though
He was also bullish on Silver and Gold too(which didn't turn out so well)
Did way too much coke in the 80's.
Dude is eccentric as fuck.
He has a cool wife though
I like the guy, he speaks the truth
This.
I used to watch his show and got up to like $1,500 in silver and $3,000 in gold before he started promoting bitcoin which I think was around $50 at the time.Although I fell on hard times and sold all my coins at a profit.
His best advice is Bitcoin.
Regret not watching him earlier.
I could be Bitcoin millionaire.
True Chaos guy, but his wife looks looks like a goblin.
He seems genuinely intelligent if a tad autistic
