Have any of you guys ever tried Amazon to eBay arbitrage dropshipping?
What kind of software do you use to automate everything as much as possible?
I can't think of a dumber business model.
After you take shipping, returns, and fees into account, you'll lose money unless there's crazy profit margins (100%+ on >$10 items.)
Some faggot actually does this to my products on Amazon.
It's quite hilarious.
They make probably $3-4 a MONTH by arbitrage.
It makes me laugh.
The retard could just loan out $100 worth of bitcoins on an exchange and make that same amount instead of going through the hassle.
