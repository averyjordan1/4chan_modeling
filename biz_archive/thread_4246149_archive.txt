Binance coin has shown remarkable growth lately , get on the train while it is still under 2$
biz really doesnt care about true value bets , keep investing on shitcoins guys
Binance coin>not getting on Kucoin sharesDon't forget Kucoin was $1 before the fork, and afterwards will probably rally to $1.50ish
yeah and binance show strong signs that will go over 2.50$ .
investing in bnb doesnt mean you have to go allin.
have not researched about kucoin maybe it is also a good investment
because they keep adding weird coin that pair with bnb like yoyo and nul
