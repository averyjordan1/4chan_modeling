so the universe granted you a second chance at being an "early adopter" of Bitcoin via BCH, the return of Satoshi's vision and dethroning of Core.
did you take it?
This is just a massive pump and dump.
A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money from this while a people orchestrating this will make tons.
I'm a newfag and cheapest I couldve bought btc was $3k during the china FUD.
Bought 22 BCH at $700 avg price.

you can only tell yourself that for so long before you exit the denial stage and into the depression stage
I'm 50/50 BTC and BTH personally, but a lot of people are fomo buying BCH/going all in and it's all going to come tumbling down at the choosing of the whales without warning.
> Be me> Invested thousands into mining hardware in 2016> Quadruple my investment in a year> Hear about BCH> Ditch all my BTC for BCH after fork day> Clear several grand buying low and selling higher> Stashed a ton of BCH for the inevitable flippening> Havent slept for four days, still selling all the way up, maybe I'll be able to buy back cheaper, but who the fuck cares> Feelsgoodnigga.jpgAll you shills, haters, and corefags keep it real.
I've got Xmas shopping to do.
