Why don't people also fork Ethereum to create for example Ethereum Gold and other iterations like Bitcoin keeps doing to drive up the price and giveaway free money to hodlers of eth?
because forks and free money is REALLY BAD for a coin.
it only happens because every bitcoin fork is contentious and has all but wiped out bitcoin's "deflationary" status.
