All the whales who pumped Shitcoin Crash to ridiculous levels, placing massive buy walls at 0.4+ surely have a plan to sell their bags right?Anyone else betting on BCC pumping?
i think the most recent pump was a skirmishthe one coming is the real battle and it'll fuck BTC in every crevice because USDT won't be around to prop up it's value like last time and bitfinex will close before the battle begins.
i think betting on anything other than BCH is fucking foolish at this point.
and i'm not being political.
don't care which coin is the king.to me the coin that makes me money is king
exactly, I dont think bcash is gonna replace btc but there's a massive pump coming for an easy flip.
the miners wont give up this easy
The coin which actually can process transactions.The coin with a dev team not funded by AXA.
