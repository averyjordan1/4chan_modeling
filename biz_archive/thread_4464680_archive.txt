>btc goes down>alts go down>btc goes up>alts go downExplain this
I'm balls deep in LTC so I don't have that problem
FAAG goes up, other shares unaffectedFAAG goes down, other shares unaffectedBitcoin has unfair advantage and this is a big problem.
Even giants like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google does not have power over other shares.
has a silver feel to it
LTC rides the BTC prices pretty well.
It dips a bit and then goes up since people use it along ETH to transfer.
btc goes down>>alts go downyou must have shitty alts.
BTC goes up, people sell alts for Bitcoin.BTC goes down = bear market, people sell alts for Bitcoin then sell bitcoin for USDT and sit it out.
just buy confidolow marketcap
BTC goes up: Money flows out of alts into bitcoinBTC goes down: Money flows out of bitcoin into USDT.
Dropping bitcoin value means alts, valued in bitcoin, also lose dollar value.
People lose confidence and exit to USDT
FAAG cannot dictate share price or crash the entire stock market.Bitcoin crashes the entire crypto market everytime it goes up or down.
buy $1000 of alt coin>tomorrow bitcoin goes up 10%I don't know how to reconcile how angry this makes me.
not valid for BCH AHHAHAHAHHA
