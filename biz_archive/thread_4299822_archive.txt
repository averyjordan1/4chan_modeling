this is why poltards will stay poor.
Either you centralize with the big blocks or you centralize with the LN.I prefer the LN
are koreans funding these threads?
LN is easier to regulate and control and therfore censor
What LN Will Actually Look Like>What People Think LN Should Look Like (Not Possible!
)>Not PossibleSo what you're telling me... is that true communism can't be achieved?
what im saying is that bch is harder to regulate and censor than a coin relying on lightning network
Can Koreans have guns?
Mined exclusively by communist state-owned miners>Harder to censor and regulate.
