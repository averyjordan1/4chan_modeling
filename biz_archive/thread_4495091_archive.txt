I never see any threads about this coin here.
Curious to see what you lads think of it.
Waiting for the lending platform to launch.
This is a short-midterm hold for me.
It's not a coin that /Biz/ likes, for some reason.
lendingHmm.
I wonder why...
Holding a nice little bag of 3k SALT in hopes of lamboland short term.
how is salt different from ripio credit network?
theyre both about loans/credit right?
All you have to do is google /biz salt and you'll see the mass amount of threads
I DUNNO OP.
YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR KEGELS SO I CAN'T REALLY DECODE WHAT YOUR BABBLIN ON ABOUT.
HOWEVER, ERIK VOORHEES IS A LIL GREMLIN BOY AND DOESN'T DO HIS KEGELS EITHER.
BLESS UP CHILE.
If you aren't buying this every damn day with your sheckles for your gefilte fish, you are destined to be low energy.
This is literally, now listen when I say this, literally one of the only sure things in the cryptospace.
Does it pay dividends

I'm waiting in queue.
Really need this thing to go live so I can get some cash for my crypto.
Just buy as much as possible and wait around a month.
Then share your gratitude with the deserving
Bought some, seems promising.
Also, if biz hardly ever talks about it, it is a good sign.
We do, its just the btc drama shook out alot of weak hands since the platforms so reliant on btc not shitting the bed.If you think tether/bch are overblown threats then hold.
It won't take off.
Ethlend is a better project imo
