DEMO JUST STARTED AND ITS TO THE MOON FROM HERE ON OUT
Looking really good so far, UI looks badass
i like it, easy on the eyes
Actually looking good.Why did they let the font girl speak so much tho
Yeah, a heck of a lot better than lots of current exchanges that's for sure.
((Looking at you, etherdelta)).
If it has lots of features like stop losses then I will definitely end up using it.
Vizard pnd pajeet thread...
Oh well, let them try PnD it.
It's a legit coin and I think it's going to go up regardless of those pajeets if the demo is anything to go of.
Fuck me anon, you're right.
The pajeets made this 'fake' UI and reveal too.
The crafty bastards!
Damn.
Got into crypto too late to buy Block.
Masternoders got it made.
I've been holding this beautiful coin since $1.
I'm so balls deep in the green I couldnt care fucking less about some dumb low liquidity pajeets scalping the top off this amazing project.
Its going to be their loss in the end for looking for quick profits instead of playing the long game.
Me too haha, bought 5000 over the course of around 2 months for an average of 4 bucks per coin.
Making a cool 2k per month just off masternode income
4288167How does this masternode work?
You just hold the coin?
4286553WOW.
They have a working decentralized exchange already???
That looks slick
Could have been a good project, shame that they had to add their own token.
What the fuck is the problem?Buy the token, get rich.
FUCKING LMAOhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c29kk/blockstream_investor_emails_leaked_shows/?st=J9UCOM99&sh=27502141
What do you mean?
The coin is used to secure the network.
This isn't an erc-20 token running on ethereum, it's been in development since 2014 and has it's own blockchain.
5000 coins are needed to run a service node which relays orders and runs full nodes for every supported coin.Here is the mobile trading platform:https://vsa.invisionapp.com/share/VTEETLR59#/screens/262415181Here is the desktop platform:https://vsa.invisionapp.com/share/DSEETJAAV#/screens
You do realize they already dumped right?
It is already working, however that UI isn't implemented yet and spv wallets are still in the works
Bought 1000 today
