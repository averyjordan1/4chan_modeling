We all love NEO but what about GAS?Pretty low supply and it will obviously moon when NEO moons but is it better to go all in on NEO?
Based on the previous pumps I've seen, GAS is a better buy.
The price of GAS relative to NEO tends to pump whenever NEO pumps.1 GAS is currently .68 NEO but I've seen that ratio much higher during pumps.
