Surely Korea by itself hasnt got this much power in the market?Should i be looking to invest in NEO in the upcoming week?
Weird, I was told Korea and Japan are the new China.
they will never beas long as China holds 90% of hashing power
Japan isn't in the game yet, and China knows it.
They're doing all they can before Japan sets up their own coin-farms.
so mining in China is still legal but you just cant trade it?, im confused.
MonaCoin moaning factories as far as the eye can see desu senpai
NULS, idiot.
unironically this though.
