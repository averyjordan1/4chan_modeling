i wonder why are some people even selling monero.
dumb fucks, probably pajeets
The only issue with long term XMR is when the government regulates crypto then this coin might be in trouble.
Once I hear Congress wants to make a bill on crypto I'm selling XMR right away.
Interestingly enough btc regulations can be slipped into any Bill that's put in front of Congress.
Bill can be about healthcare, but have a little clause about crypto.
Found the guy that bough high
Weirdly I think the opposite.
If anything it's going to increase in price as it becomes harder to get hold of.
The rest of the world is not going to stop using it for DNMs just because America regulates it.
