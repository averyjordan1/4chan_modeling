If you fags would just put the BTC USD chart on one screen and BCC/BCH on the other u can just watch at 7700 ur trading BCC at .147-.149 at 7800 ur trading at .144-148 at 7900 its at .138-.142 u buy when they get close to 8k then sell when they drop close to 7.5 you will make a 10 percent profit on that usually from .14 to .155 WHY ARE U JUST HODLING
This advice alone is worth more than 10 years of teeka membership use ur brains fags TEEKA is selling his products to oldfags if you swing trade this you will make 10 percent everytime and you can probably do it 3 more times at least today
