Why you have not still purchased SALT LENDING token?Buy now for $4 and sell at december for $25
I already have some.
a real sleeper of a coin, but biz is too busy going full autismo over BCH.
tell me this pajeet, why doesn't the company accept 1 SALT for $100 ?
Fuck off.
Buy DRP for x10 in december
literally who shitcoin
kek I know right, its terrible has no potential at all.
Thanks for warning everyone!
Why 10X, and why in December?
Have you done even a seconds research into this platform?
The coins will be worth $25 (at the initial/lowest price) when the platform goes live and will only go up from there.
It will trade at a slight discount on exchanges so it should be easily worth $20 by EOY.
If you haven't bought in, it's only because you haven't DYOR & are waiting for more of us to spoonfeed you.
This was your warning.
Take it or leave it.
I've made SALT threads for weeks & went balls deep at 33k sats.
Up % already.
Buy if it dips below 55k & more if it breaks 53k or alternatively if it breaks the current high at 60k.
how does one DYOR?
What exchange is this on?
