this shit is on freefall for weeks now, what is going on?
are the shills working overtime to demote this project?
because people are loosing interest as nothings happening to it but all will be fine when its released
1: They only take BTC as collateral at launch and before BTC vs BCH is over, it's risky for anyone to actually use it.2: People are putting their shekels from alts into betting between BCH vs BTC
keep thinking bitcoin cash is any competition at all.
you guys are a minority, why are you trying to start shit
Cash is dead, mate.And OP, SALT will be fine upon release like the other anon says.
