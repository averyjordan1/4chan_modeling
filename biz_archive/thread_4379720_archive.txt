Why is nobody on the "/biz/ - Business and Finance" board actually building or running a business?Why is the entire board just crypto threads?
because anyone doing that has already been through here and gotten the info that helped them get that far.
But you have to wade through memes and digimarines, and no one likes doing that
Because crypto is still netting a lot of people 100%+ gains in days regularly right now so there's a frenzy
i'm using /biz/ as a means to build initial capital for my future business endeavorsI don't have much now
digibros will always make me laugh, especially those who holded the 10x loss hahahahahaa
I'm working on a shopify store with unique clothing designs in a niche that hasn't been tapped.
I don't post about it here because it's a waste of fucking time I got better shit to do.
