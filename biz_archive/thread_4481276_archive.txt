What happened to cause chainlink to crash like it did and why is it not worth way more?
Are there any oracles that are successful?
It seems obvious that something like chainlink is needed...how else will contracts like ETH actually work without useful information?Not a shill post, I'm not a holder yet.
>how else will contracts like ETH actually work without useful information?The exact same way it works now??
devs refuse to communicate which led a lot of fud which leds to further decrease in price.
and now we are here.hodling a lot of links.
im not concerned it will be successful.
but i dont know if you can make any shorttherm gains.
but if you are interested and if i were you.
i would just put some money now and then into it.

So zero communication to the outside world, very dumb/limited, and not very many use cases.Gotcha.
The exact same way it works now?
?>LINK is a shitcoin>Hurr durr smart contracts are useless its only for ICO scams.
Dont you faggots realize decentralized oracles are the only way for smart contracts to move forward?
Link mainnet is far away, we probably won't see price movements until 2018Q2.
I'm not selling however as December announcements might trigger a moon (which I don't think tho)
nothing's been released yet and everybody in the crypto world is an ADHD child that wants everything to be a PnD shitcoin
Have you seen communication change at all?
very dumb/limited, and not very many use casesYes, OP dont buy LINK.
Its total shit.
I'm getting tired of these faggots.
