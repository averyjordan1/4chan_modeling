I just went all in on this coin, because nobody is shilling it desu.
Everyone is screaming that it'll crash on here, it's fucking sad.
It's SJW tier shite.
I don't care if it bleeds, I'm gonna hold for a while.
I see a lot of comments pointing at this coin for being the liberal coin LMAO.
I think bitcoin cash is alpha af.

these fear posts ("BCH dying nooo") don't care about your money /biz, they just care about their cold wallet BTC bags
More balls than me!
