>mfw i bought btc at 6300>lost 1k in a dayCmon BTC pumpBCH is a shitty scamcoin
I'm exhausted by all thisScammers scamming scammers 24/7 365 days a year"Fuck your mother if you want fuck"Disinfo everywhereNobody really knows what's going on.
The wild price fluctuations are evidence of this.
It's all just fear and greedEveryone only shares "facts" that will net them $0.01 if an anon takes their advice regardless of whether it's bullshitAfter all this, I just want to move into the countryside and live a wholesome life without worrying about money or shitcoins
