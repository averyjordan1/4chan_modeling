My holdings:SUBPOWRARKNEODCRUBQNow these coins I got them when they was at their lowest when BTC was temporalily over 8k I snatched them up for cheap.
It seems ARK UBQ and DCR aren't very good performers as they've only really went up around 10% while SUB, NEO and POWR have given me greater gains.
My conclusion is that newer coins and coins in the top 10 will usually give you higher gains when BTC consolodates and goes sideways.
ARK seems like it was always in a downtrend and will continue.
This picture shows ARK right now, performing poorly, though when I look at the 1 day chart it looks like it'll have another run like it did months ago, though its not garenteed to happen.
What a dissapointment it will become when it just bleed until next year
>tfw balls deep into ark but everyone else keep dumping
Actually nevermind I was at one point 20% up on ARK but the lump looked so small I didn't bother selling...
