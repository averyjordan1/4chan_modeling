Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now

There's no way to dump their bags without having to sell at a loss.
The price will plummet before they sell even 5% of them.
They are all in.
There is no pump and dump.
The game they're playing, it's die hard or win hard.
you must be the only loser who hasnt bought Bitcoin Cash yet, hahahaha look at this faggot
