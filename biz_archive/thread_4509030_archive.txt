Why is Enigma mooning (well, at least approaching ICO price again)?
Any news I missed or just whales doing their thing?
Couldn't find any newsworthy entries on their blog...
Shh shut the fuck up Still accunulating
No news you can clearly see lots of alts are mooning, seems like people are going back into alts again
