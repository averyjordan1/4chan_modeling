Like anyone is actually going to buy BAT to support their favorite youtubers.
They'd view advertisements and spend $0 doing so before they spent money on BAT.
I think you guys are seriously overestimating the willingness of people to spend money, and overestimating the general population's generosity.
I mean people use adblocker and give zero shits about who it hurts, so what makes you think they'd go out of their way to buy BAT?
I don't know, maybe I'm missing something.
It's twitch but cutting out the middle man with crypto integration, dont be silly
you make a valid point but what is patreon ?many youtubers have it by now and they earn A LOT of cash with itso there is money to be made from beta whiteknight cucks
BRANDON FUCKING EICH HAS DONE IT AGAIN
have u ever watched twitch or chaturbate?
yeah, I feel like patreon is a lot easier for people to use.
BAT adds an extra layer of complexity to those kinds of donations, and I feel like most people won't want to bother.Could become more accessible in the future though, I mean it has the javascript/firefox guy behind it.
