Yes, clear out that memepool so that the BTC can finally get to the exchanges.
:^)
So decentralized.All of the miners suddenly decided to clear the mempool
It's almost as if they go after the chain that brings the most profit, wew.
Miners switched back to legacy for the next couple hours or so to bring down unconfirmed transactions so people can liquidate there legacyget out before its too late
BTC most profit now?
k tx unconfirmed and falling fast.
How will BCH bagholders ever recover?
Lol at the stupid BTC cultists who married to their coin.
Explain yourselves chinks.You are ruining the whole crypto.
People flee this shit.
Marketcap dropped by 10%.
You expect these to return after this shitstorm?
Eventually yes, either we see a moon back to 6K or a dip to 5500.The interesting thing is Bcash is not going up.
But BTC keeps going down
Effect of the unconfirmed transactions being cleared?
