Why are people abandoning this again?
its been almost a month and it didnt moon
Because most of the nitwits on here are looking for a quick pump and dump.
I'm trying to sell all my stack of request at a minor loss.
I don't believe request will move anytime soon, I'm looking elsewhere but its hard with request having such little buy volume...
Same reason all alts are down.
90% of individual "investors" in crypto are poor people gambling with their life savings in an attempt to escape poverty.
When BTC surges they panic and drop everything at whatever price in an attempt to ride it to the next peak.
Since (((no one))) knows what this peak will be, it's a dangerous strategy unless one has the wherewithal to spend every waking moment of life watching numbers move on a screen.
If you think this sounds good then more power to you, but the gods of better wisdom will tell you that there are things more valuable than money (like time, for example).I don't even hold any REQ but can say with reasonable certainty that it will redeem anyone holding it, many times over.
People need to learn to be just *a little* patient (like a matter of a few months).
Inb4 muh opportunity cost; you can't count what you never had to begin with
> more or less holding steady or slight dip when btc moons hard> btc goes sideways, req moons hard AFstay strong anon
