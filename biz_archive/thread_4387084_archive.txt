Currently $11k in LINK, $5k in NEO, $1k in BTC and $50k in stocks.
Looking for $100k in crypto by March 2018
My $11k in LINK was once worth $26k, damn you Sergey!
Damn you to hell!
Literally just ditch the stocks and put that 20k on Omg and the other 30k in BTC
you are more likely to lose it all
Why OMG?
Your net worth will be 9k by year end
Take our your stocks and go all in LINK.
Focus on REQ, MOD, NEO and ETH
All in on ETP.
You were dumb enough to believe in the miracle, believe in the unknown gems.
11k in link lmfaohow did someone so stupid get so rich?you shouldve just gave your money away desu
Put it in ETH or BTC and don't look at it for 5 years.
So go all in LINK, AND buy these other 4 huh?
