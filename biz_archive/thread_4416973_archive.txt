Hey guys, quick guide on how to get rich quick.If you haven't been following what's up with AtheneLive's ICO, here's a quick recap.
He's a Youtuber/Livestreamer that went downhill over the years.- They're launching a cryptocurrency that will be used to get items/consumables in a game that's currently in development- Their current ICO is at 0.5$/PRPS- Their plan is to buyback PRPS at 0.5$/PRPS when it will hit the exchanges- You can get the same rate of PRPS for charity donationsHere's the moneymaking part :>Make sure to check your cap on tax deductible Charity Donations !>You link your Twitch account to Gaming4good, their platform (gamingforgood.net)>You head over to their livestream and donate X amount for charity (AtheneLive on Twitch)>Once the transaction goes through you will have unlocked a Purpose panel in your Gaming4good account>Once you've gotten your Purpose on the G4G platform, HODL and document the donation to charity for your yearly tax report>Once the ICO is over, you'll be given a wallet key and you'll be able to use it like any other crypto>Once your yearly tax report comes, you get that donation money off off your taxes and the situation is : you spent 0.25$/PRPS token >Wait for it to go live on exchanges, and you can either hope it goes to the moon (never will imo) OR you can double up when they'll be buying PRPS back at 0.50$Thank me later, or send me BTC here :1QKYVcuq1Dy6XrX8dgS5pT1gHzvyydutyD

ETH was funded the same way, as "donations" as a reminder.
If they want to look legit they'll have to back it up.
