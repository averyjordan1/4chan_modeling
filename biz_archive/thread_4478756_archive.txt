Long story short I'm in debt around $4000.
I know to most of you this isn't anything, but i'm constantly thinking of and feeling depressed over this.I do have a stable job, but I've been living abroad for the last 3 years with my wife and it's a huge hassle to send some money into my account.
In the few cases where I can send money over it feels like it barely makes a dent into the debt.I've seen it asked time and time again here with little to no responses, but I might as well give it a shot too.
Are there any ways you guys know on how to make some proper extra cash online?
I've tried Affiliate Marketing with considerable success, but the amount of time I'd need to dedicate as well as money just aren't on my side at the moment.Hopefully some of you financially smart people can help me out.Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this.

That's it.
Take out $40,000 loan, buy bitcoin, wait a month, sell bitcoin, pay all loans back.

Wow you guys are quick.As much as I'd love to go crazy on bitcoin and all that jazz it's not something I can possibly do for awhile.That's exactly what I've been telling myself, but the thought of debt after a life time of being in the clear just nags at me.
Thanks for the kind words though.

This would probably work, all jokes aside.
It may not even take a month.
