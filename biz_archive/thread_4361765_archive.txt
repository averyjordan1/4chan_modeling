Please, don't miss out and pick up some cheap XBL.
I usually don't buy any coins shilled around here, but this one is an exception.
Can't believe biztards found a gem like this.
Just bought a BUNCH of Billionaire Tokens!
Any proof of what you are claiming about CE listing and all the other stuff?
Sounds worth a quick PnD thanks.
Yes, Look at their ANN thread.
The Coinexchange listing is paid for: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2065888
you sound like an infomercial
 the entire utility of a coin is a raffle> compares itself to funfair
>>FAZK2PgZI may sound like an Infomercial, but there's nothing wrong about that.
Do your own research on XBL and see for yourself that I am right.
I remember looking into this shitcoin weeks ago.
I'm sure someone'll pump it, but I don't recommend holding it.
nice 70k volume on a pajeet exchange$600 on etherdelta with a 10x spread between bid and asklol
Looking into this is does seem to have potential, they have poker on the way, dice games and more the raffle is just the first thing to be released.
Think I will pick a bit of this up as it does have some potential, thanks anon.
>>iDcq2/5UBetween EtherDelta and Cryptopia, Cryptopia is a much much better exchange.
I'm not surprised nobody trades on EtherDelta.
Nice meme coin find.
Pump on CE is inevitable.
Looking at the charts on this it doe seem really low at the minute and is very volatile when it pumps, CE listing could easily make this a very nice x4+ due to low supply.
4361920Surely its not that much of an upgrade from cryptopia?
CE is notorious for big pumps on new listings with P&D groups so I can easily see a group picking this up and running with it as it will be easy for them to pump this up very high due to the relatively low supply.
