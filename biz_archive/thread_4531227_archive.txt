How does it work?If you wan't to do it safely either make an offline paper wallet or get a physical wallet.
If you wanna fuck around and probably lose everything leave it on an exchange.
depending where you live, your local train system would need some kind of pass or card that you use to pay for your train trips.if you visit your local train station they will be able to help you out, with 10k im sure you can ride the train for a very long time
