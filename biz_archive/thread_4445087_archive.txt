Anyone done business with friends and been screwed over?
I learned the hard way you must NEVER do business with friends that know things about you.
Because jealousy and greed will get the best out of us.
yes.
I agree it's best to, in a practical way, separate business from pleasure.It's hard to mix the two because you have to enforce boundaries nonstop that otherwise you wouldn't have to in a business setting.
If you do, make sure it's a good friend.
Remember that they are your friend foremost, and you will need to prioritize aspects of the relationship that may impact business based around the fact that you're working with a friend.
Also, you are not Musk reincarnate because you got some business cards printed and managed to show up at an industry expo.
DON'T let it go to your head.
egos and haste will fuck a naive young /biz/raeli.
Best strategy - find working partners or investors that understand how you work and give you the space you need to get stuff done.
Friends are cool, but it can lead to situations where someone will exploit the soul of the friendship to advance their business goals, and then everyone gets sad yet paid.
