If you run a small business which has a lot of profit, say more than $200,000 of profit in the first year, is there a good reason to buy things you don't need and write it off as a business expense?
Can you save more on taxes if you don't show a profit?
Ask your accountant.Accountant fee might also be a valid tax expenditure, so it's basically no cost to you.
