I have $1000 that I invested in Litecoin that went up to $1050 but then cashed out cause of my stop order at $1000.Should I put it back in now even though it's a bit higher then what I bought it at, or are there better short term gains on the horizon?
Perhaps Neo or Monero instead?
bumpAlso considering OMG
How about you make your own decisions?
You should at least have half of your portfolio on a long-term coin like LTC or BTC.
POWR is guaranteed money in the next month though.
This is my view of Litecoin.
From what I see it has been for the most part trading in an upward channel, I could see this continuing over the next couple of months,giving traders buying opportunities near the lower trend line and selling opportunities near the upper trend line .
I have not really been trading Litecoin, I am in it more for the long-term (min.
1 to 2 years) soI mostly just buy on any dips, I did, however, sell a large portion of my position when LTC spiked up over $90 and have been rebuilding my position ever since.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/LTCUSD/BDF2VKmL-My-View-of-LTC/
Should I buy now or wait for a dip?
$100+ moon, soon
