If you’re from Reddit, specifically r/Cryptocurrency or r/Bitcoin you’re not welcome here.

Never heard of this r/Cryptocurrency or r/Bitcoin.
You sound like you know an awful lot about it... Not welcome.

imo le leddit gives better real advice on investing than /biz/ does desu senpai
They don't even.
It's where PnD groups go to shill their bags.
The ASIC resistant meme was fed to those cucks, and they're still hyping it.
They still haven't caught on to Nuls or Dcorp.
And there are so many dumbass fucks that post the same shit every day.>Guise, Bitconnect is a scam!>How do I use EtherDelta?>Mods are censoring discussion!>There's so many shills here>The fork was the biggest scam!I remember someone posted that graphic of holders vs. traders, and it said "newfag" on it.
Some virtue signaling white knight cuck was all>Remove that slur and repost or be reported!That was the day I decided to never go back.
Besides to shill my bags, lol
it's because of /pol/ infestation that the average IQ on this board 
Did the bad men on Reddit ignore your link spamming again?
How dare they not buy your bags.
I'll be asian for you babby
That's not even remotely true.Believe it or not but it's harder to astroturf here than there.Also a lot of anon have experience with shills from /pol/ so it's easier to distinguish PnD to legit investing advices.
what's that pants called?
You clearly dont belong here.
Its easy to spot those who just entered the cryptomarket this year with these kinds of posts
