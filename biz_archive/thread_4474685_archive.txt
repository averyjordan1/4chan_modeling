>sold my BTG at 0.069 on bittrex
Bought the same price.
No joke.
.61 BTC cut in half
selling the real bitcoin for 6% of its true valuekek
MOMMY MOMMY
At about 400% of its actual value, ΤΒΗ FΑΜ
Why is anyone buying this shit?
I got a ton of it by mining fast and hard at the start of the fork knowing that idiots would want to buy it way above the cost of production at that time, but 240+ wallstreetbux?
That's crazy.
Buy high sell low never change /biz/
Is this piece of shit going to pump again?
