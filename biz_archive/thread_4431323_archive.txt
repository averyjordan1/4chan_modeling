In a couple of hours the chinks are gonna wake up.
I've been visiting them in their sleep and whispering good things about NEO like, "Rook at dat buy warr..." Get fucked Noneos.
Chinks don't care about NEO and they can't even trade it.
HELLL YEAH THE ASIANS WILL MAKE IT GO UP ANOTHER 20% YEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM GONNA FINALLY MAKE IT
>NEO finally stops bleeding>Holders who bought in at the top acting like hot shit

Why are neomarines always so rude?
neo target of .0075, use this info wisely
when the dust settles this will retrace to 0.0045 or lower
You are deluded as fuck.Neo has never been popular with the chinks, just look at the volume less than 10% is on asian exchanges.
90%+ of the volume is from western exchanges.. the chink's have never really cared about this coin it's just pure fomo and hype by westerners with "muh china eth" "muh chinese approved ICO" ectIf you're actually interested in the chinese eth its QTUM, just go look at the volume on asian exchanges that's what they actually care about.But this shit has been a great pump I made 4 BTC off this pump and i didn't even buy in till the news dropped, just don't fall for the meme and lock in your profits because the whole "chinese ethereum" thing just doesn't exist, chinks don't care about neo, period.
Ni Hao Wealthy China Man

Did you see relative volumes on NEO before China shut down the Chinese exchanges?
It was majority volume in Western exchanges
