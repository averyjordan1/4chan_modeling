Ethereum on a bit of a moon due to BTC/BCH craziness.
It's a safe bet if you're looking to stand on sidelines so you don't get dumped on.
I can totally see ETH coming out on top after BCH and BTC fuck each other over several more times
once people realize the bch fork worked, ETC will also overtake ETH.
now is the time to buy ETC
nobody gives a fuck about this unsecure overhyped turd anymoreenjoy bagholding
yeah I moved all into ETH and alts, exchanges will be forced to switch the pairing to BCH/Altcoin if it goes through.
braaaaaaappp!!!
*sniff sniff*
Is this a good idea giving the flippening that's going on?
I've just been putting the bulk of my portfolio into eth since it's stable.
I'm planning on getting into crypto, haven't invested yet but ETH looks like the most stable of all of them.
<-- Hiding in NEO and making good clean honest money in the process
Why is ETH holding its floor at $300?
