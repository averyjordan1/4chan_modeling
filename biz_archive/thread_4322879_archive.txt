For anyone that saw my thread yesterday about bch hitting .25 possibly spiking up to .30Well it hit .50+ on bittrex and the Korean exchange where 20 billion being used to buy bcash server went down from overload apparently.There was announcement that they're opening back up at 520 pm i believe in their time zone it'll be about 14 hours from now.If that's the case then i wouldn't be surprised if it spikes up to .60 or .75 by tonight.Or it might just dip after .50But shit is crazyKeep in mind that bitcoin core develeopers is in favor for bcash taking over in 6 months time frame.
I think the miners are in favor for sooner than later
