i waited 28 hours with "high priority" fee suggested by blockchain.infofuck this
it's almost like someone is spamming the network with pointless transactions to create an artificial bottleneckbut who would do such a thing...
bch thinks its hot shit
kek
(((Who)))
reminder that bcore is to hillary what bch is to trump
this
IT WAS CORE'S TURN YOU RACIST

MBGA!
I think you worded that wrong
Core is grassroots, BCH is centralized power.
So your analogy is ass backwards.
yeah, bcore is to bch what hillary is to trump*bcore: pro censorship, pro centralization (inb4 ln isnt centralized)
