RSI and Bollinger bands can help you see when to buy and sell more efficiently
I use this shit:R(V,P) = (2^V/c)*(3^P/c)where:V = Weighted sum of n period of volume differences.P = Weighted sum of n period of price differences.c = constant equal to the max value that any of the weighted sums can achieve.Works fine when you try to visually spot short term changes in trend.
what is R in this regard also how do you determine c is it just the greater of V or P?
R is a function of V and P, which returns a unique point that you can plot vs time; c is equal for both cases, so you only need to determine it once.
You calculate it from the best case scenario given your personal weighted sum formula, which is the most important part of this.
In my case, the idea is that when V and P are stagnant, the function tends rapidly to 1, but when both are rising fast, the function tends to 6 rapidly also.
The numbers 2 and 3 are completely arbitrary.
I forgot to add some parentheses: R(V,P) = (2^(V/c))*(3^(P/c))
Stoch RSI and MACD are my favorite
