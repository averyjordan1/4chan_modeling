Seriously when will it stop mooning.
It has to come down at some point right?
Slight dip at 10k then no brakes to 20k
I (who has no history of knowledge of this market) predict an ATH of 8600USD, at fork, will plummet to 5K, will be 12000 by March.
How much is a slight dip cause I just SODL hoping for a decent sized dip.
-$300
Did you forget a zero?
pfft.
a crash to 6k is dream fuel for us now.
before end of year 10k will be the new floor.just buy every single week and forget about saving a measly 5%.
Yes it will stop, after the fork.
Be patient, please.Also, the flippening has started already.
Don't expect imminent crash.
aaand here we go just broke 7400 eating ~100 BTC on offer in a split second.
This is just ridiculous.
