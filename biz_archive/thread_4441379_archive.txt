With qualities that outperform vertcoin and currently sitting at less than 1/4 of vertcoin's price...MOONING IMMINENT
Redpill me how is it better?
point by point
Here you go buddy
Vertcoin is explictily anti-ASIC and the developers have said to change the hashing function if an ASIC is developed.
Does groestlcoin have the same vow, or is it like LTC which had a different hashing function to be ASIC resistant, but didn't change once an ASIC was made?
It's rising!
definitely a sleeper
