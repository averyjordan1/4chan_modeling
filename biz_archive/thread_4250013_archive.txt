HAHAHA LINK IS MOONING
and then the dump
look at the massive buywalls
in which i'll buy more fucking link,theres literally no losing with this beautiful bastard
>everything held by /biz/ memelords is mooning
It's not mooning.Some whale that sold the top probably bought back in now that he realized there's no point in holding BTC because there's no fork.Plus look at the sell wall at 3k lol, we're going back below 2500 in about 15 minutes.
keep chatting shit while i watch it go up even more.
L-link is n-not m-mooning goysL0L the same reason it dumped so much is because only 2% of LINK is trading it was so easy to manipulate since everyone is selling for the fork.
Now that its alt bullrun time hmmmm and theres only few LINKs on sale what do you think will happen?
KEK!!!!!!!!
eoy predictions lads?
Anyone see that 8 BTC sell wall just get obliterated?
sell wall eating in 2min
wall gone, rekt
Does anyone have the link to Binance's LINK wallet?
I want to know if whales are getting ready to transfer and dump their bags, or if they're already in

a ultra highspeed cam was needed to see that wall got eaten

HAHAHAHHA LINK FUCKING MOONING
