Liaoning Province has more than one million vegetable greenhouses and is one of the most important export destinations for agricultural products in China.
Lately, reports have been appearing regarding the immense drought affecting the favorable yield of Liaoning Province, something proper IoT technology can help mitigate.Processing of food from agricultural products produced 8.2% of the countries share of gross industrial output in 2015.
Gross output is equal to the value of net output or GDP (also known as gross value added) plus intermediate consumption.
With a GDP of 2,866.9 RMB bn in 2015, that means that the agricultural products produce 235 RMB bn ($35B) within the industry.In partnership with Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences, VeChain will be providing the chain-based data storage and interaction platform for smart green agriculture in greenhouses.
In the process, VeChain is building a proprietary blockchain agricultural cloud platform for green organic agricultural products incorporating an NB-IoT(Narrow Band Internet of Things).
The NB-IoT will be directly deployed on GSM, UMTS or LTE networks to reduce the deployment cost and it enables smooth upgrade at the same time for clients.As a result of this partnership, Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences can provide related data, IoT equipment, scientific farming methods and scientific fertilizers for greenhouses to achieve meticulous farming and management of the growth process of agricultural products within the province.
Through the deployment of various NB-IoT equipment like sensors, controllers and digital cameras inside of the vegetable greenhouses VeChain will be able to offer a vast array of functionality using personal computers and smartphones.
VeChain will be able to provide updates regarding the data of climatic change, soil regime agriculture, crop growth status, water and fertilizer use status, equipment operation status, and even remotely controlling the process of irrigation, ventilation, and cooling of their products.Currently, there are twenty-four research institutes in Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences, with fifteen national (international) research and testing institutes, eight national-level original seed bases, five agricultural science observation and experiment stations of Ministry of Agriculture, sixteen provincial key laboratories, nine agricultural engineering technology research centers.

Why a blockchain solution?The VeChain Smart Agriculture solution improves the quality control and product tracking transparency, and finally to eliminate the trust crisis regarding green agriculture authorization among consumers, to enable the precision operation thus to improve the quality control and product tracking transparency, and finally to eliminate the trust crisis regarding green agriculture authorization among consumers.VeChain itself will be able to handle essential use cases for smart agriculture:Perform a precise measurement of the air quality, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity and ambient air temperature utilizing existing BME680 environment sensor.Conduct data packing and ensure the integrity of data by using digital signature technology transmitted through NB-IoT Network.Ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data by conducting verification through deciphering and signature-cracking process, save all valid data through the VeChain IoT Cloud platform, and presents all data related to the terminal users through visualization methods like diagrams and bar charts.
What does this mean for token holders?A partnership with Liaoning Academy of Agricultural Sciences allows VeChain the ability to develop a proprietary blockchain agricultural cloud platform with a critical institution with massive resources.
The development of such system not only means increase VEN use within the academies locations themselves, but provide an ample amount of data, connections, and credibility to push into Liaoning or any geographical region looking to enable smart agriculture.In the short term, even the Agricultural Sciences academy alone will provide more use of the blockchain than the majority of existing utility coin blockchain solutions.
Couple this with the prospect of incorporating the product into areas exponentially larger than Liaoning Province and VEN would be the highest used token use among any existing blockchain technology from this one solution alone.
The more the token is used, the more value is inherited to the token itself given the current economic model of VeChains token distribution.
