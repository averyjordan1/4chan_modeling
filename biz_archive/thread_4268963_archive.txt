RDN is shit and will be forked out or made irrelevant by another SC technology which does not jew the users by introducing a usleless token.
but isn't the whole concept with crypto to create a token based economy where all services have their own tokens and are thus independent?

The Car demo makes me think this will make ETH and IoT work
Their part in the presentation is at 3 hr 50min
Too much drama surrounding this token right now.
I would wait before investing.
Do you guys think it will reach 0.00028 BTC?
I saw this got listed on Binance where I have NULS.
I might take some profits from there and put it in this to give it a try.
W O R T H L E S S E R C 2 0 T O K E NWhy the fuck would you buy this?
It has NOTHING to do with the protocol.
Jesus christ.
Vitalik hates it.
He already funds alternative projects for state channels just to teach Raiden a lesson.
lol all this fud out of nowhere tells me it is time to buy more
