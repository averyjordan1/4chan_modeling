why not?
Please stop shilling this and DYOR.
I need to accumulate more
You don't, it gets shilled by biztards and pumpgroups, soon it will be dumped.Reqholders will become the new linkies.

Link have the upper hand with their Swift relationship and tech but their communication is so bad that it's offensive.
