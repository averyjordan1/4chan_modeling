Brothers i need your help!!
go and do something to keep you busy
bro, listen.if you sell LINK, you are literally going to kill yourself in 2018 when we are all driving off in our lambos to go to our yacht clubs to meet our 10/10 trophy wives.
do NOT sell your LINK.
do something else.
go play a vidya game or what have ya.
Literally go a FUCK yourself, please, please for the love of god, sell, faggots like you don't deserve to make it.
Sell.
You'll feel better, and we can't moon until you're out
imo.. we wont moon until its on much bigger exchange with higher volumes.think of current prices as great early entry.think of all the people who wanted to buy bitcoin a year or two ago... but found it too difficult so gave up.
Thats the mentality of most bittrex / poloniex users.
