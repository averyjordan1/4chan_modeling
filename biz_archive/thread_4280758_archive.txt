Good idea right?
Maybe.
I thought about selling some too but I didn't .
Neo is too valuable to me.Anyway if you buy neo back after BCC mooned and before neo mooned you did great.All focus is on BCC now
Very good speculation
I never touch my neo
4280779Where's the ceiling gonna be on this do you think?
You better hope so
I shouldn't have done this at 2am...
No fucking clue.
We never had a situation like this.
That's why I won't touch my neo and play safe.
Got some BCC in my portfolio though
