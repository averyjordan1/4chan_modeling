Anon, this is literally your last few moments before liftoff.DBIX is and will be the coin of the middle east.
This is a whole region that suffers from corruption.
In fact, an article came out recently on Bloomberg how Saudi billionaires are looking to move their funds somewhere else to avoid their assets being frozen.
That bodes well for Bitcoin and more specifically, ArabianChain's coin DubaiCoin.
This coin currently only trades on Cryptopia which has a 24hr volume of around 6 million.
It has been announced to be listed on HitBTC and may come anytime today, tomorrow, or the near future.
HitBTC has well over 200+ million 24 hr volume.
DBIX only has a supply of around 1.5 million.
It's market cap is is 15.6 million.
WWhen a whole region is being targeted, especially one as wealthy and corrupted as the middle east, this has a LONG way to go.
Don't miss the HitBTC pump coming any moment, but this is also a great long term hold.
I'm loaded up senpai
Arabs will pump their own coin, so i actually will invest in this lmaoArabs are crazy about lambos and shit, so this will probably moon
own 500 DBIX.
Won't sell until it hits 300.
yessir
what do you think the time frame on it going to 300 is?
Serious arabs dont trust arab tech just saying
-6 months
Bought 300 DBIC at 5$ dollar when it started mooning, didn't sell back then though.It kinda does feel like a PnD coin, but then again I can't really lose anything at this point.
DBIX*
has a supply of around 1.5 millionIt's mineable, boy.Sure it may pump, so throw some change at it and see if it sticks.
But it's no golden ticket, the "arabs will pump it" is a meme.Why the fuck would they pump it?
It's dubai coin, what about RiyadCoin or DohaCoin lmao...
