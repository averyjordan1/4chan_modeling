So it was a month ago that the next PBC report would talk about a solar coin.
I'm worried about POWR anons.
PBC said this coin they'd suggest will be on Bittrex but POWR only got listed there a week ago, Teeka couldn't have known this coin would have been on Bittrex a month ago.
SOMEONE PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG SO MY BAGS FEEL SAFER.
you shouldnt feel safe.
PBC pick is 100% not POWR & all the fake leaks are a clear indicator
He also went on to say the new pick is not necessarily going to be solar related after slr and powr pumped from leaks and speculation.All indicators indeed suggest that it's DNT this time around.
THEN WHY THE FUCK IS IT PUMPING SO HARD?!
It was known POWR would be on trex well in advance.
There were many rumors about it.
If the leak was fake they wouldn't have pushed the announcement back.
Whether it's still the choice remains to be seen
Since when did Teeka Pajeet become so influential in alt coin trading?
I'm making bank every week without his insider trading schemes
lmao what?
The announcement was pushed back because the seg2x fork was supposed to take place on the same day.
Fuckin retard
