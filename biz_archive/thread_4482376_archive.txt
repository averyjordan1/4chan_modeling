I transfered my ETH from Bitfinex to coinbase so I could cash out and it still hasn't arrived.
This REALLY fucking sucks.
So you lost nothing dumbass.
This isn't funny retard, transaction doesn't show up on coinbase and fucking bitfinex doesn't even give me the transaction has number
its not in your withdrawal history or pending withdrawals?
It's on "recent withdrawals", it's processing apparently for about an hour.
Most eth transfers are like 10 minutes maxNothing shows up on coinbase though
https://etherscan.io/
ive had ETH transfers take around 45 minutes fyi
so you didnt lose anything and youre just retarded
how do I find my Txhash on bitfinex ?
it will process eventually, chill out, I've had bitfinex withdrawals take up to multiple hours
If you didn't fuck up the Coinbase address you're good.
Bitfinex are known for sending withdrawals long after you request them.It's obviously the first time you do one, obvious retarded newcoiner
sounds like you got bitfinex'ed
My BTC withdrawal has been "processing" for 7 hours.
Stop being a bitch OP
they specifically say it can take up to 12 hours fuck off nsa fudster
All other exchanges I've sent or withdrawn ETH from have been far more transparent and fastFuck off shill, I'm done with Bitfinex.
I only have some IOTA there, which I will transfer to bittrex or binance soon
Wtf are you slagging the NSA for you sound like an establishment CIA pedo
>money still hasn't arrivedFuck bitfinex
Show us the transaction on Etherscan
im curious, how much money you cashing out on?
If it makes you feel better OP I transferred 1.3 btc from Bitfinex to Binance and it took nearly 7 fucking hours.
Bitfinex withdrawals are complete bullshit
I only have some IOTA thereWhy not make a fucking binance account?
Why are people even buying IOTA on bitfinex instead of binance?
I don't know the Tx number, fucking bitfinex won't even show it to meIt wasn't on Binance when I bought it
 dollars

yes they do nsa fudster, if you cant even work out your exchanges interface why are you in crypto
$65 ScamAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIn all seriousness just wait, bitfinex and binance sometimes take a while to process withdrawals.
Can you kill yourself you broke faggot?
Wasting our time and your familys time.
impatient as fuck.
You're gonna trade it all away under FOMO eventually anyway, with that attitude.
65 dollars
