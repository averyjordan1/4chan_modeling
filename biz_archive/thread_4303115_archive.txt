I saved up ~$80k cash to be a house down payment and emergency fund.
A house where I live is like $400k on the mid-low end, so I just barely hit the 20% deposit and it would mean no emergency fund.
The more I think about it the less appealing this route really is>buy house>slave away for next 30 years to pay it off>maybe completely financially independent by 50 if nothing else in the world changesI'm thinking of starting a mining farm.
I've done the math and would get %50-80 ROI over the course of a year.
Sourcing 50k worth of graphics cards is next to impossible though.
Then there's the issue of housing them somewhere.
I see it as a way to invest in crypto without exposing myself to any particular coin since I just mine whatever is most profitable.Also thinking of investing it all into crypto (current top 4 plus assortment of shitcoins).
That's going to have the most reward, carries a lot more risk, but both are damn risky.What would you do?
Everyone says it's not enough to start a real business, not nearly enough to make a living doing real estate.
It's so much money, but so little at the same time.
I'd also be pretty crushed to lose it all, though my situation wouldn't really change, would just go back to wage slaving.
I spoke to an assortment of people at Devon, ethereum, ethereum, ethereum.
It's right under your fingertips.
It's going to change the world in a couple months/years.

If you can start a mine based on the new Vega GPUs, you could pay off the initial cost in less than a year, plus you can resell the GPUs for almost MSRP after a year.
ethereumBut Vitalik is a fag and smart contracts are impossible to get right.
You might be right though.
I also have the cost basis bias, that I don't want to buy more expensive eth/btc/whatever.
Can't let that stop me from making a good play though.I was looking at RX480s and 580s.
Not sure about Vega, will check them out.
