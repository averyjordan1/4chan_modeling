So I decided to start investing in penny stocks after the recent dip we just had in btc.
You know, making my portfolio a little more varied can’t hurt.
I’m curious though, why all the talk over crypto rather than stocks, ETFs, or bonds?
Hell, WeSeed investors make sometimes 17% annually on their investment and its secured by a lien.
Basically, even if the company sucks in a year you still get your percent of the pie first.
