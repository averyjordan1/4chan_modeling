So soon six hours waiting for the first confirmation.
I bet Blockstream is creating the queue so that nobody can transfer their BTC from wallets into exchanges.
They're only delaying the inevitable.
That would make things even worse.I do t think this is intentional btc is just ass and slow.I had to wait 24 hours the first time I moved btc from blockchain to an exchange.
