If you cost average it as a btc holder I think it's a better hedge than even bch or other alts because the network is very reliable and the holders generally seem mature and long-term oriented from the price action in the past.
people think unit supply doesn't matter but it does in the sense that a smaller supply gives the price action better "resolution" in that the market cap varies less with the price action than large supply coins.
that aspect combined with network strength, place on polo, and the other factors I mentioned are all reasons I think it's a good hedge against btc and worth running wherever you have 556 mb free
