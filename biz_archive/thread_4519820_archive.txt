Is there some sort of bot or app or something that can give me alerts on my coins, or coins I'm watching?
Eg.
if a coin spikes or drops 20% in 5 minutes, so that I can react quickly?
Even Blockfolio alerts seem a bit slow, and have to be manually programmed to certain levels rather than as a percentage deviation from the average.
never change /biz/ buying a coin already at its 3rd stage of pumping
