Why do miners matter in the valuation of BTC/BCH?
sell your coins if you have this little understanding of crypto
First explain what it is you think miners are doing.
They don't.
Okay.
Miners use their hashbrown power to receive coins.
I would assume, and this isn't really obvious from the name, that they facilitate transactions on the network as well?
Seriously, get the fuck out if you are asking this.
Miners have A LOT to do with valuation.
How do you think your bitcoin or bitcoin chink gets from your wallet to an exchange?
If miners arent putting hash rate to a coin the tx backlogs will build up and people wont use the coin and it wont be valuable.
people this brain dead are invested in cryptolmao
Yep, and I will make bag holders out of every one of them.
.... wow
Miners only matter to theoretically protect against attacks.
I'm not counting "facilitating transactions" because if a coin has a problem with not enough transactions going through it's because the coin is shit, and doesn't have much to do with miners.
So miners basically don't matter when it comes to valuation.
But that's just in theory, because in practice there's plenty of retards like itt who think miners matter and that mistaken belief has an effect on btc vs bch valuation.
