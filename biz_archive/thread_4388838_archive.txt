How long do we have and what are your post-pop plans?I say 2-5 years max before we hit '2001',
Something something shoeshine boy.The second I have a million, I'm cashing the majority of my stash.
Timeframe is who the hell knowsPlan would be to mostly cash out and do extensive research on what could rise from the shit to become the technologically superior successor to BTC.
Not everything was killed from the .com bubble pop and not everything will die from crypto
I think the biggest question is how big will the bubble get before it pops.
Will Bitcoin hit 100,000?
Will some alts go to tens of billions in market cap?
something something more years something ill be rich by then and cash out in perfect timing

The second I see an ICO with a Super Bowl ad I'm cashing out.
When bitcoin was passing $5000, i wasn't tempted to buy, not at the least.I thought "when I'm tempted to buy bitcoin, then you know the crash is near"$6k, I didn't feel a thing.
$7k, i started to get nervous.
now that it's recovering I'm nervous and want to buy.
Might want to instead compare crypto to technology capitalization on nasdaq in 2000
even if it pop, in long term will be ok
