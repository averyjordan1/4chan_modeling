>im taking 10 dollars in bitcoin and seeing how far i can get it
invest in civic and you will have 1000 dollars by the end of the month
Youre gonna regret it either wayEither it goes up and you cry about not buying moreOr it goes down and you lost valuable time checking charts
i was up to 13.50 and now im down to 9.70. trying to get back to 11 before i cash out.
Wait.
It was a joke, right?
All in on powr.
Check the graph.
dude your gonna pay coinbase 12 dollars to convert your 10 dollars to BTC

is there a site any more normie than coinbase?
it would cost you $10 in fees to buy bitcoin
