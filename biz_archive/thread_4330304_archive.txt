INTEL is a nice buy, they are coming with new AI chip and judging by how they got their shit together.

The competition between these two companies will outgrow them.
I have holdings in both.I wouldn't invest in NVIDIA.
Google seems to be doing good in AI but stock is overpriced.
Same with Amazon.
invest in musk for when he inevitably has to take down the rogue AI menace.
In three years Tesla will fold and in five Elon will be living in a cardboard box yelling at imaginary drones.
