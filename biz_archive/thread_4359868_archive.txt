Go ahead core cucks, tell me why Bcore is better.
b-because gregory m-maxwell said so!
*slurp on maxwell fat cheesey cock* o-oh Adam Back pls not so hard
Core cucks will be crying to mommy when exchanges flip
It is slightly better but not as good as segwit+lightning network will be ,plus the damage it would do to the entire crypto market “flipping” to BCH isn’t worth it.You could say that ethereum is better but it doesn’t mean shit.
It's bitcoin core not become, alright?
