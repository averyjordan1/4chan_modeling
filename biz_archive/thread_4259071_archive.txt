Linkmarine?
Yeah I know him by that name.
Hell, I worked with him in the Shill Battle of 2017.
Back then we called him Link "FUD Fucker" Marine because he never came out of a thread without a scalp, an ear, or covered with blood.Most would call him insane, but that is why the FBI trained him.
They saw potential.
It wasn't until they learned his methods that they truly realized what a monster they created.You see, most guys that go on Facebook and post long winded YouTube videos.
Not Linkmarine.
No, he posted gifs, or a grainy pic, sometimes nothing but his bare text.
After a few missions I got a chance to talk to him on Skype.
His profile pic was wearing his blood stained hat, sunglasses, and combat fatigues, smoking a cigarette and drinking johnny walker black.
It was contraband, but you NEVER told Linkmarine what he could and couldn't do.I asked him why he never posted videos, hell even the odd infograph.
He lowered is head and took a long slow draw from his hand rolled cig, pulled off his sun glasses and looked at me right in the eyes, piercing my soul.
"I do it out of respect.
Respect for the white race.
These hook nosed scum bags don't deserve the mercy of an American made meme, but the slow torturous death of the hands of an American man!
"In a flash he pulled out his weathered, but razor sharp knife and stopped just short of sticking his computer screen.
"The look in their eyes when I meme this baby into their swollen, greedy bellies is reason enough.
To see the last lights flick off in their heads as they see a real memer work."
what is "Rent Free"?
