APOLOGIZE THE GUY IS FUCKING BRILLIANT
But he's not
I hate Buterin when ETH is going down, but when it's going up he's pretty cool.
He sold his ETH because "it's not worth more than $8".
Real brilliant.Pfffffft.
Isn't he actually kinda dumb?>commie>brilliantNice joke anon.
Don't make it again though

Actually I hold plenty, it's just Buterin is just a person I find unlikable.
Not smart enough to eat
He's worth 110M, and even before Ethereum he made 2M from his bitcoin magazine.
The guy is a fucking genius
THANK YOU MONEY SKELETON

He is very smart.

He really should be worth more than 110M though.
Maybe he keeps some portion of it in Monero.
