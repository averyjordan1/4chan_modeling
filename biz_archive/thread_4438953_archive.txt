>tfw rising wedge on bitcoin charts>tfw dont care, all back in fiat
Yea it's pretty obvious at this point BTC is just gonna bounce off 8k for a bit, I'm suprised people are still FOMO'd out of alts
I was thinking about buying the bottom of BCH under 1k.
What's you're strategy?
BCH is just a 50/50 gamble, it could moon and flippen or it could get forgotten and die, depends what the whales want.I just went into ARK during this alt dip, I don't really have a good strategy I just have a good feeling about it and it's got some new developments coming out soon.
How do you feel ETH is going to do?
People are saying it'll go up whenever it switches to proof of stake but I don't know the details, it seems like it's stagnated at it's current price for a long time so I wouldn't expect big profits.
vitalik will just give your gains away , dont buy
He'll give it to good deserving victims of your oppression.
