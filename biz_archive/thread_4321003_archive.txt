Why do people wanna be so asic resistant?
Asic is a good company.
They make good shoes, and there prices are pretty good.
Plus there's free shipping on orders over $50.
Wtf biz?
Why you gotta hate on asic?
we're all in NewBalanceCoin
Quality shitpost
There is nary a better foot glove to traverse the mean shitting streets of Mumbai than Asic brand Asics.
I don't shit on the street without them.
100% Pajeet approved.
they make nice sneakers
Asics are good running shoes desu - were my main choice when I used to run competitive cross country.
Now I'm a 300ib wastrel who browses 4chan most of the day though so don't really have need for good running shoes.
