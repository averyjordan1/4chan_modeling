Two questions, i need to get some more BTC because i want to buy more ark, do you think bitcoin will drop back below 8k any time soon, or is this the new baseline.
and second question, do you think litecoin will go over 100$ before the end of the year?
also should i just buy some extra bitcoin to hold onto, i know i probably should but i only have limited fiat right now and want to get as much into something that i could still go to the moon with
If it does ark will just go up more.Arks staying really stable at USD price, so if you're goal is just to buy ark with it I wouldn't worry about btc price it is reflected in how cheap ark is right now.
>ARKaaaaaahahahahahaha hows that ARK VM going you fucking idiot?
oh whats that?
they say its 55% done yet there isn't a single word about it in their whitepaper and the only evidence it exists is some unintelligible scribbles on a white board?

You said two questions.
Deal's off, senpai.
You need someone with a time machine to answer your questions.
But I'd accumulate as much Ark as possible.
