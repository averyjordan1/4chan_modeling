Now is the time to buy NEO.
I'm all in.My cousin lives in Beijing and he's saying that Chinese crypto forums are on fire right now with news of a rumored announcement from the Chinese government this afternoon.Whether the announcement happens or not, this FOMO in China will have a significant impact on the price in a few hours.
