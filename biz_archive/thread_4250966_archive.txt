Anybody else sitting pretty after 2x got canned?
My portfolio is already up over 10k from yesterday.
jesus i strive to be at your level, but im still up 40 % since yesterday.
Can someone tell a brainlet the reason why it was cancelled?
It was obvious that it would be canceled.
No consensus.
Nobody supported it.
but I also love how it reinforces my belief that Nick Szabo is Satoshi.The dude put "NO2X" on his twitter handle yesterday.
