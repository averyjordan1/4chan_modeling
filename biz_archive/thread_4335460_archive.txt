I think that bitcoin cash is a great buy, in my opinion its increase in value is only starting.
:)
I think that bcrash is a terrible buy, and in my opinion is due for a full retrace back to zero

Transaction fees on BTC are no good.
I think that Bitcoin Cash is an O.K buy, and in my opinion will go sideways for a while.
It will be the real Bitcoin when Core fails!
