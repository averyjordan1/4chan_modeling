DID I FINALLY MAKE THE RIGHT CALL???
BOUGHT THIS 2 WEEKS AGO AND IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE ITS GOING TO STOP MOONINGWAKE ME UPPPPPPPP I DID SOMETHING RIGHT THIS CANT BEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH 10GIOTA TAKE ME TO LAMBOLAND
You not dreaming my nigga
It's been on a sat downtrend since Aug 17th so hopefully it would have gone up again at some point.
Nice call on when though
remember to take profits don't get NEOd like some of us
won't get NEOd because we don't have retards screaming china regulations.
All the news is decent and a core dev just blew vitalik out of the water on twitter.
Made the right choice, man.
You are comparing a one day pump and dump based on fake china rumours to IOTA which has been growing steadily despite all the FUD and shit talking here on 4chan??
IOTA is going to $5 unless BTC crashes again or some other fork FUD comes up; which is not going to happen.OP dont even think of selling this before $5 or you will find yourself fomo buying back higher like I did this time.
December is gonna be a wild month.
Hhha damn I didnt even know about this!!!!
Trillion dollar project or nothing

The guy in charge of Stratis also said they would be a top 3 crypto or they've failed and that didn't amount to muchdid the guy in charge of Stratis invent PoS> gtfo, bro.
this team is solid.
IOTA isn't stopping until $15
Iota has already hit $1 before I sold then... maybe I'll sell again now idk
The guy who invented PoS isn't the same person who claimed a trillion market cap either
then stay poor, bro.
if you can't see what is happening in the world outside of crypto, then you'll never get it.
enjoy your neo bags
