November 30th.
Big Goy Theory is doing an episode on bitcoin.
This is your final exit pointBitcoin will crash down to 2900 after this
Isn't it supposed to climb as more goyim will become aware of BTC?
Fucking goyim
I would think Bitcoin will have a bunch of new money flowing in.
You know what percent of people I know that are invested in Bitcoin?
Like 1%, how many have even heard of it?
Like 25%People that watch Big Bang think they are smart so watch them flood into the market.
And they will do that on coinbase.
sigh.
I forgot bitcoin traders never saw a chart before this year.
Have fun losing money

I forgot bitcoin traders never saw a chart before this year.What previous events are you referring to that caused BTC to crash before?
Because Mt Gox taking 10% of BTC supply and killing the trust in it in the eyes of the mainstream for a while isn't the same as some shitty show having an episode about crypto
When dumb money flows in (thats you) liquidity will be at its peak and that is when the big boys will take their profits
exactlyit'll be just like DGB but on the largest scale known to man
