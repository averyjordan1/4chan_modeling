I am newbie trader and I got some nice profits in from BCH, DASH and XMR and now I am ready to bet big on LTC.
Here is my working thesis; LTC is no the no bullshit replacement to BTC and the logical choice as a substitute; I am not talking about some flippening event and I don't think LTC is not antagonistic towards BTC as some of it's other substitutes and can scale perfectly to meet the market demands.
Anyway, this is just my intution; what do you all think friendos ?
Ltc has worked better than btc for years.
People are just deluded religious fanatics.
