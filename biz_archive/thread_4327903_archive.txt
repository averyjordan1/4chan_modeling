Honestly, I probably wouldn't get too much money but enough to live comfortably.Imagine the negative attention and power 100billion would give you.
No thanks.
I'm not smart enough or gangster enough to handle that.
I'd make the investments necessary to earn about 100 mil and then become some sort of researcher in red pilled matters that are chastised by the science community.
If I did decide to earn anything exorbitant I'd use all the money to fund research to contribute towards some sort of superior intellectual race for galactic colonialism.

This message has arrived to you from November of 2017.
I will not know anything about the future after that.Hannah will leave you.
Ignore her.Buy literally as much Bitcoin as you can the moment you first hear about it.
Any time before 2017 is appropriate for buying.
Do not sell when Bitcoin crashes in 2013 and 2014 because it will grow even bigger in 2017.When you meet a woman named Michele in college, run away.
She literally drugs you, frames you for a robbery, and convinces a middle aged man to rape you and it's terrifying.
She's like the supervillain of a fucking movie and will try to seduce you.
Run away.Don't fucking take those ridiculous PhD courses your sophomore year of college.
Listen to your advisors.
In 2017 October, take all your BTC, all of it, and dump it into Ethereum.
This will make sense later.
Then hold until June 2017 and sell.Following this advice, assuming you didn't change the future by following it, you will now own a significant portion of the world's money.Watch out for Jews.By posting this message I ensure that my younger self receives it and thus this is the end of my life as I know it.
Goodbye.

Ya.
That's what I was getting at.
After a certain amount of money you start becoming a threat to world powers.
The only way I'd take that risk was if I had some sort of plan to start some sort of entrepreneurship in something I truly believed instead of just holding onto muh wealth.
There's still a decision on if you want the attention 100 bil or whatever brings.

Buy LINK, BNT, ETH.Short BTC.
Dear 8 year old me:Spend more time with your grandparents and other family.
Eat healthy, get plenty of exercise, and never stop learning.
Try to make friends at school even though youâ€™re highly autistic at this point.
Donâ€™t worry about college, hopefully the new version of you will be way smarter than I am.
Find a career you love.Save any money you get and invest it all in Apple stock at $13 (around March 2009.)
Keep investing until it reaches $175, when youâ€™ll sell it.
Put the profit from doing this into a decent house and some land.Sincerely, 18 year old you from November 2017
you really think you can give 12 teams for all 17 weeks in 30 seconds?
Betting establishments have maximum betting amounts on parlays so they don't get fucking wiped out.
Aren't lottery balls such a chaotic system that even the tiny change in your behavior from getting this information will change the result?
Like air particles acting differently for 9 years
Scratch the Apple idea, shouldâ€™ve told myself to dump all of my money in bitcoin when itâ€™s less than a dollar and hold until it reaches $7500.
Then alternate me could live a comfy NEET life I can only dream ofI immediately thought of that too, the butterfly effect would change the outcome of that significantly
