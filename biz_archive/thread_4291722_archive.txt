Anyone else see anything weird happen around 4:50 am today?
Shouldnt you say what coins you got and then ask?
I get this sometimes if I have a coin in my portfolio that's listed on Etherdelta.
Someone buys for too high, and I'm a multimillionaire for a second.
cash out
could he have actually done that?
sorry if its a stupid question
If he could convince someone to buy his coin for that price.
No.
He would have to have an order that someone fulfilled at that insane price at that exact moment, or fulfilled the crazy order himself, due to the way ED works.It could have also been something like 0.0000001 coins bought @ 1m ea or some dumb shit like that.
it literally always is this
No, lad.
That’s just the latest price sold at.
If some idioto accidentally fat-fingers a buy, you get that... very rare for two idiotos in a row unless his order wasn’t completely filled before he noticed
Stop monitoring Ether Delta price and this wont happen again.
It will correct itself if you do it now.
