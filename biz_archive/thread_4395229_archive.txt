Have my vast wealth on Cbase at the mo, too expensive and too limited in markets, I'm also concerned about the long term security and have also found it impossible to get cash out.Can anyone suggest a good platform that I can send my BTC to from my Cbase account and have the option to get fiat out when I want as well as taking a punt on some other coins?
Kraken, though you can only cashout to euros, apply for a fire bank card and convert it for free to pounds
