Who else is thankful for taking a risk and listening to some neets on the asshole of the internet this year?There's likely a crash/hefty correction coming but not worried cause I've been though several.
We're all gonna make it.
Happy Turkey day /biz/!
being thankful for losing moneyfuck /biz/, the only thing I'm thankful for is the fact that the whole crypto market will crash soon
Make no mistake, I've been dumped on plenty of times and scammed plenty of times.
But overall it's been a Upward slope.
I would have never taken that initial step if it wasn't for people posting their incredible gains on here.
Here in the old continent we don't celebrate thanksgiving, but I'd do it if I'd have more than 100â‚¬ in crypto.
