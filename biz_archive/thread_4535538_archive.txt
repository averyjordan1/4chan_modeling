Anyone owns one?Worth it?
Mine is on the way, should be here in a few days...
I haven't' got one yet but I willSeems great for the long holds/accumulation just for the sake of security.
what if the piece of shit device fails?
is your btc kill?
Is there any possibility of a backdoor or relayer back to the company?
Do you have to trust Ledger not to implant something in the device?
Have they been audited?
key phrase whatever its called to be used for recovery
Huge relief.
Storing my PK which has access to $50k on my computer, even on a mac in a password protected folder, felt shady as fuck.Huge relief to have my recovery key backed up at a family member's house, and my Ledger in my safe.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong - but I think the ledger source is on Github
It is is worth its money
is it open source hardware as well?
That is something you might have to double check up on.
for downers who cant handle simple security.
but sure, waste your money
you can open it up, it isnt hard to disassemble if you've taken apart electronics.
actually very easyits not an overly complicated circuit, arduinos have a bigger circuit
i own oneif it's cost is 5%< your portfolio you should consider getting one.
It's great for long holds and feeling comfy.
Keeping it all on exchange, otherwise how else I'm gonna day trade stupid?
How do you more experienced holders handle it?
