Is Bittrex working properly for you folks?Also is FCT still going up or is the pump done for today?
When should I buy.

it's been fucked up for me since last night....the pages for coins don't load up properly or load very slowly.
Exit scam confirmed.

Ah glad to know Im not the only one.Really takes a while to load the info and shit.I have to close and reopen the tab a few times until it finally loads up.
btc-usdt page is fucking up for the last few hours for me, all other pairs work fine
Hasn't bittrex always been like this?Also buy FCT up to .1, thank me later.

problems here toojust like yesterday night
no, I believe it really started to get shitty after the last bcc pump.
the influx of volume probably fucked up their systems or something.
feels like they are getting fucked by a DDOS.the page isn't even loadingfuck
Overall I'm underwater on FCT, but I believe in it since it is a great project with too many NDA's.
Zoom out at the trading cycle, you're at ground floor now, this is a good time to buy.
This is what XMR looked like 3 weeks ago - and it retraced, FCT will too

Kraken was slow too.
Polionex was alright.
