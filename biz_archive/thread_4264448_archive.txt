Hello my fellow Australians and hello to the people from countries the world over, I'm Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.Recently it has come to my attention via my friends at the bank that the emerging new technology "cryptocurrency" using a "blockchain" is the way of the future.
Now as a member of the LNP I am scared and intimidated of the future, much like all my voters, however, as a liberal I am also quite fond of money and my friends at the bank have given me the subtle headtilt + slight wink of approval so I am on board.Now I don't much understand this new technology and I say with confidence I don't plan much on trying to, however as Arthur Sinodinos (George Costanza) explained to me what he knew of the new technology he mentioned there was a "mining component" to the system.
This was all I needed to hear, I am close friends with many in the mining lobby/industry and since Adani is proving to be so problematic I think this new mining technology is a good middle ground to finally get a bit of good PR.
I recently found an Australian project run by the current mayor of Perth, she is a little progressive but we won't hold that against her.
It is called Power Leger and I am happy to endorse this Australian project.Remember I Malcolm Turnbull always put a long on cryptocurrency never a Shorten.
