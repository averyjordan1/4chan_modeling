Buy dip?
Bump

Lemmie know when dip ends cause it just keeps goin

It is steadily crashing.
Why would you buy now after it skyrocketed from .20 to nearly .80 cents within a few days?
So sell now and when to rebuy?
When did you buy in to sell now?
If it is PBC...
If not then sell now sure to rebuy about 2/3 what it is now but... PBC.
Gambling is fun!
It'll come back I know it
Lmao same I brought at 10c AUD, sold at 85c.
No point sitting around after a pump like that.
I'm cahsed out and waiting for a proper correction to buy back
>buying in less than few months after 400% growthdon't do that unless you hate your money
Nice!
I guess I'll just hold!
Best of luck, god bless
