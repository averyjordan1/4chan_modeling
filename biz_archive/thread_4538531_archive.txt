KILL THE DRAGON.
10 MORE HOURS.
GET OUT OF BITCOIN OR DIE WITH IT.

Bitcoin is actually forming a rounding top at the moment.
There have been enough warnings on biz by now.
Normies will pay anyway.
But will you be on the winning side?

You fucking dont bite the hand that feeds.You fucking snake
Even Caesar was killed by his own kind.
It's just evolution.
Miners are the hand that feeds.
Core bit them, now they're striking back.
Where the blame lies is obvious.
Look for "operation dragonslayer" on youtube to get an overview.
There's a video with a red dragon on a chart.I found pretty interesting what it said about the difficulty adjustment that's going to happen in 8 hours and how that can effect BTC / BCH.
Diff is going to drop retard
BTC is the parent that outlived its own usefulness and become abusive.
The diff goes down on btc.
I get the feeling that Bcash is a death cult with a suicide pact that hope if enough people lose it all and kill themselves at the same time their souls can board that interstellar asteroid and leave this galaxy.
nope.
it's ETH ATH day, and it will definitely steal the show.
Last time this happened BTC dumped in anticipation.
Now it's holding steady and that's apparently a bad thing too?
Dragons are big in China it's Dragonslayer not kill the dragon?
this post is sayantifically aproofedtrips of truth
It seems slow tho
This.
I mean what the fuck, if bitcoin is going to be overtaken it's not going to be BCH.
Retards being retards, /biz/ as usual.I guess now is the time to short BCH because of all the screeching from dumb money about it?
