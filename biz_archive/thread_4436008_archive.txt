Sorry, I'm a newfag.
Why can't i move this chart to the left?
Is that a new coin?Might be, there is no previous trading history
click and drag, or use their advanced trading interface
This user is correct.
The charts only display trade history from when they were listed.
Not to mention you also have your setting set to 1w candles.
It's a new coin or something, the week chart isn't able to go that far.
Set it to a couple hours instead.
4436070it's LINKthanks, I'll switch to that.
What's different exactly?
it sounds complicated
LINK was launched 2 months ago.
So, ye, you cant go any further
you are using the week candles dumbass
JUST
this has got to be the best anti-LINK thread i have ever seen.gj OP
4436089I just noticed it's steps of a week.
