why should i keep a gf when there's always new prime females like this to fuck desualso eth vs btc seems like a losing proposition at this time.
might as well gamble on some shitcoins
eth and btc solve two different problems, they are not competitors.
If it wasn't for ethereum, bitcoin wouldn't seen the same growth and vise versa.
BTC solves the coal industry problem, ETH solves the accessible funds problem
