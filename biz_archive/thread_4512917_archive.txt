EXIT ALL MARKETS
That's the result of mining a coin idiot
It's not a law of bitcoin that you have to mine transactions.If some idiots wants to waste money by mining empty blocks, they can.

rly??
OMG??
yeah nothings going to happen btw
Lmao
Happens all the time, especially from Antpool"Empty blocks (blocks with one transaction, the coinbase transaction) usually occur due to SPV mining where the miners have not validated the previous block before building the next block on it.
This means they don't know what transactions were included in that block so they do not include any transactions in the next block until they have validated the previous block.The other blocks with few transactions may happen if the entire mempool of the miner's node was cleared by the last block and they have only received a few transactions when they began building the next block.
This may be unlikely, but not impossible."
