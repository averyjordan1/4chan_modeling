hello all.
usually I would avoid the site but there is speculation on r*ddit (BATProject is the only real BAT community for the moment) that the coinbase CEO intended to offer BAT - Fiat pair.
that is the only potential news I can think of, it's rumor at this point.
the site posted it's conditions for offering an ERC20 token on coinbase, and people seemed to think BAT really conveniently checked all the boxes.
>inb4 seeing what you want to seeyeah I would really like to see that, as I bought 10k BAT at $.22 ea.
I'm not holding my breath on it, but I do try to check the developments time to time.
