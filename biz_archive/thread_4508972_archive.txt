Gentleman, I would like some advice.
I will be away for a week from this coming friday till next in a tent in the mountains with no internet access.
I currently am 75% XMR and 25% ETH.
What would be your recommendations for my holdings since I will literally be cut off from the outside world?
I was thinking just HODL but I'm confus.
Halp.
only 1 bump
I don't see anything wrong with those positions OP.
I would recommend adding LTC too if you want.
Avoid the BTC/BCH bullshit until you have an internet connection again.
OP is just gambling if you aren't at least 50% in BTCI went for 30 days off grid in august.
A week is nothing.
You probably wont even detoxify that much.When I was gone shit mooned and then returned to baseline.
In retrospect what I should have done is set reasonable sell orders.
You want at least half in BTC in case it moons and wrecks everything.
