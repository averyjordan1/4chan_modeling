Is MEW safe?
Do I really need a hardware wallet
Also would you recommend Trezor or Ledger for erc tokens?
Get both.
Dedicated laptop only for managing your JSON file on MEW is good enough anon.
Ledger nano s. Theft proof as long as you set a good password on it.
You have to be physically near the device to confirm a transaction even if by some miracle someone tries to steal coins off of it.
MEW runs client side.
I think it is actually made by the Ethereum people too, and not some chinese third party.
If you're worried you should be making your addresses while offline.
Disconnect from the internet.
It will still work.
