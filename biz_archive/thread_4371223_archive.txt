Well in order to kill BCH completely, you'd have to nuke all of Asia.
you don't understanding how mining works.
Only to appear "non-hostile" and to not be an outcast if BCH fails or doesn't completely BTFO BTC.
He's just hedging his social strategy.
and what would the purpose of btc be when bch can be a store of value AND a currency???
somebody has to pay core's backers.
It wouldn't have any value.
Btc will get obliterated soon
Im olay with that plan.Can we also nuke africa, just to be sure?
There isn't one.
BTC will eventually be the equivalent of a paper gold- you're always "promised" it's there, somewhere, but you can never take ownership and actually move it because fees are too high.Bitcoin Cash is going to need major exchanges to add more direct fiat pairs.
I have the most hope Coinbase will be supporting it
This.
Europe and Australia too just to be safe.
What's the point of investing in tech to make your coin spendable if you then pump the value so high, so fast, that nobody will ever choose to spend it?It gives the appearance that bcash Devs don't know what they are doing, so just try to cover all the options by over-promising.
i'm cool with that
I know it's not a perfect example but I was thinking like a debit card vs investment fund.Park large amounts in btc, keep small amounts you could afford to lose on you during day in bch.
Let traders drive prices.Or I might be retarded, I don't know.
Bitstamp and Coinbase are both adding it.
Gemini the missing link.
Btc will get obliterated soonKeep dreaming faggot
