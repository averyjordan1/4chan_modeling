It only needs to pump 10% more to 1700 or so and it'll stay profitable after the difficulty adjustment.
It won't matter how many transactions are backed up on BTC at that point, it won't be worth miners' time to go back to it.
It'll just be up and up and up for BCH.
I'm sorry I ever doubted you /biz/.
