Dad is butthurt because he bought high and sold low during the dotcom bubble.
Made the mistake about telling him of my crypto all the way before the china fud happened.
Havent sold but he still criticizes.
Realized some people just want to be right and will try to shut you down for taking risks.
Fuck their opinion and do what you wanna do, just dont sell low/panic sell
Those people are the same who will ask you later for money.
When in reality it was your money that was put at risk.Never tell anyone how much money you have, not even parents.
Even if you trust your parents, they might still tell your siblings or somebody else
Thank you /biz/.
I fucking hate my family, they're all a bunch of overly educated academics who shit on me for years for not going to college and doing poorly in High School.
I fucking knew it was all bullshit.
Right now I am now wealthier and have more money than all of my cousins put together.
It is the greatest feeling.
All of them went to stupid goy college.
All of them are in $50k++ in debt and living like shit.
All of them also live with their parents or rent a room.
This is both sides of my parents family.
Goddamn, even my dumbest idiot cousin whom no one had expectations for, too graduated college.
I, on the other hand worked shitty jobs, started my own business twice and partially succeeded.
I left college at 20 and not a day goes by where I regret it.
Kept saving and saving my money and investing in shitcoins every month.
It all paid off anons... it all paid off
You can do both m8I have a science PhD, full time engineering career and I'm balls deep in crypto
>hey kiddo so tell me about this Bitcoin.
My mom unironically thinks its drug money.
She isn't wrong.
about to finish my phd in science next year and made 10x gains in crypto the last 6 months.
easy money easy life.
i wanna fuck her ass til she cries
phd in scienceEnjoy being heavily underemployed with a comfortable job that an MS can do or wagecuck yourself to death for six figures a year.
my mom took a loan for me to invest
after my phd is finished I exit science.
better try and fail with a startup or something.
science = slavery except now you may choose your dominus yourself
how much you got?all you need now is a girlfriend.
And to clean up your room.Or better yet, move out
