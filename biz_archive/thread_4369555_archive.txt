Could you guys tell me how I can use my 0.1 bitcoin to buy some pizza to celebrate tonight?
I already wasting 0.9btc trying to buy it, but now it's just stuck and unusable.
I have 0.1btc left to try.
Should I add it to the 90k transactions that are also waiting, and maybe hope I can have a pizza in a month?
I want to see it fall through .15.

checked, and also the better image
it'll tank tomorrow when all the suckers will be soothed back into the usd

Grab a knife, chop off your dick, and use that to purchase the pizza.
HODL the bitcoin.
Who would want to trade a delicious pizza with something that doesn't work?
It is probably unused, but still
Ok, can you show me how to buy more bitcoin then?
I've tried but the transactions keep getting stuck and the sellers keep accusing me of scamming them and getting their coins stuck.
It's causing a lot of problems.
This can also be solved by detaching your genitalia and presenting it to the involved parties.>Inb4 How do I trade bitcoins for tulips anon
