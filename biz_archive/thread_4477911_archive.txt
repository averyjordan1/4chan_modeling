It seems like when it comes to predicting success I rarely see people talking about the technology behind cryptos.
It could just be that technology does not define the winner, but maybe in the long run it actually will.The only people who will end up feeling attached to a coin brand are those who get rich off of it.
If we're ever going to see a world currency it's going to have to taste good to the average masses who would just use it for everyday things.I don't think this is just a game of who comes out on top because the whole concept of decentralization means nobody should have the control to actually force the world to use the currency which benefits them most.In the end, regardless of which coin is mooning today, I believe people would just slowly migrate and transfer to the first one which is actually WORTHY of being a world coin.Why are no current coins worthy of such a position?
:1) Proof-of-Work currencies such as bitcoin are flawed because they will inevitably LEAD to centralization through mining pools.
I read an article stating that the 6 or so largest pools control % of the network and if they worked together they'd effectively own bitcoin2) Proof-of-Stake currencies also inevitably tend toward centralization as the more stake you have the higher your odds of earning more stake.
Given enough time it's simply a statistical fact that the gap will get wide enough so as for a few individuals to control everything.What do you think /biz/?
Are there any coins out there that actually have the right technology to become a world currency?If not, then what do you think needs to change?
What sort of tell-tale signs in their technological underpinnings should we be keeping an eye out for in future coins?
