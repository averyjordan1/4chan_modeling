+11% currently, what is going on?
Rebranding finally increasing the price?
Happy to have ODN and iExec to actually mitigate some other losses from LINK.
zoom out, dude
Zooming out just shows that the downtrend is truly and finally over.
We don’t know by how much, but it’s almost guaranteed to go up in price for quite some time now.
Always angry bagholders ready to dump whenever we approach 30 cents.
Gonna wait for that and then buy more.
It happens every time.
Both the rebrand and launch of the app product are coming out in December, so smart money is buying it while it's still cheap.
Obisdian, smart money, fucking TOPKEK
4501656This.
There's 5 btc buy volume.It's either bittrex or nothing.
The phone wallet / ap coming out is just going to lead to another pump and dump.
it is +15% now.obviously the volume is still not gigantic.
did you look at the market cap?
with more volume this would be 150% now.
They raped my dog!Damn you Obsidian devs!
It's got a long way to go but this is still good news.
I just hope I don't get fucked when everyone decided to dump and I'm not paying attention though.
It has gone past the bottom of the bowl.
Got in at 3300.
