I've been looking at this board for some time and I want to start investing in crypto, not asking how to make good deals or anything like that, i'll mind that by myself, but how/where do I buy my first coin, what budget would be optimal and so onAt the moment I only know how to open a cryptowallet but even there i don't know what wallets are the best to begin with
what is google: the post
4360768to elaborate, since i feel kindof like a douche for posting that, there is literally no "secret" or real technique to getting to lambolandopen accounts on poloniex and binance, watch biz for coins that are about to moon, buy said coins, and just make sure you hop off the pump and dump before everyone else does, or find a good coin that you can actually hodlyoull find your groove once you do it a few times, just play around with like 50 bucks at first until youre comfortable
First get a Cold Storage Wallet >exodusSecond get a Coinmama or Coinbase account (Don't pay by bank transfer always by card, bank takes 7 - 8 days and you can miss some big whales in that time) Send coins to your cold storage wallet or to sites like Binance or Bittrex, etc.
(Exchanges) Then do the opposite of what of most of /biz/ is telling you to do - Hold your investments (Just invest in one coin until you're happy, forget about it - but watch it - and invest in another one) keep doing this and when one coin 30x's your other's will have 3x'd / 4x'd if you're doing it right.
i don't know what wallets are the best to begin withit all depends on what your investment strategy is and which coins you wantfor instance, would you want to buy a coin and hold it for a couple years or trade with it?
I also have just started a few days ago, put most of my money in NULS and now gonna kms
just wait until it pumps again and buy more if it keeps going down to lower your cost avg (if you can)
NULSI would go with RCN they have a solid DEV team and productNext pick up in price is EOS Then I am split in ETC and ETH Some ARK
I'll rather trade with itThanks for the info, I googled for some info but given that my main contact with crypto was this board i wanted advice form here
