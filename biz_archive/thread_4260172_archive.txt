Move some BTC to Monero?im thinking to move 25% of my BTC towards Monero, Give me your thoughts
Monero is a safe long term bet.
And it will probably do at least as well as BTC.
But if you want big short term gains you won't get them with monero.
Smart
I want longterm steady gains i dont want to check my Porto everyday
