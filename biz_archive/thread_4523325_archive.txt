Hey Anon, I want to talk about why you aren't buying into a business that literally prints money?Bought the largest crypto miner in the world.Run by successful management.Ethereum is literally at ATH.Stock is priced cheap right now.Gains of over 800% this year.Opening a new facility in Sweden in December to increase mining capacity.They've been stock piling coins since inception.People are now covering their short positions and its primed for another rally ahead of the earnings report.Thoughts?Buy now or be a street shitter all your life.
