I like BCH and made a fair share trading it before and during this mess, but if there's gonna be a flip it's not going to be like this (on such shady grounds).

My buy target is 4900.
Then I'd tell you that I agree, and that 75% of my holdings are elsewhere (with that last 25% being fresh FIAT spent buying the dips during this).
oh that always works.bounce plays are one of the most reliable things you can do with the coins with the most rabid followers.

Yeah, I'm obviously foregoing potential gains, but it's worth imo to avoid devastating losses.
Just remember guys everytime bitcoin "crashes" it rallies twice as hard

We're here to make money.
