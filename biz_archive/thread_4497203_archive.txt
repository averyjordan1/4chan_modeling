Sergey "If you can't handle my 92% losses you don't deserve my 2% gains" NazarovSmh idk how this shit didn't drop to 1 sat yet.The only reason I can think of is whales (who bought @ the ico) at keeping the price above 10 cents so they will never sell at a loss.>btw we need to rewrite the entire project from scratchLaughable.
Now I understand why they didn't provide updates before kek.
If you gonna announce shit like this just don't say anything.

Forgot: I guess they we right when they said "you will never see LINK at 59 cents again".
Kek.
