A web hosting account my debit card was linked to got hijacked and the charges placed on it fraudulently were enough to put my bank account in the red.
What should my next steps be?
I already contacted the hosting company and they're looking into it and emailed my bank with the details of what happened
Didn't that guy hang himself while jerking off or something?
i would call my bank not email them.
Get the account closed down and a new debit card issued.I dont really know what else anon.
Sorry this happened to you.
Identity theft is one of my biggest fears and internet security is so intangible to me I dont know what I'm doing right or wrong
This quote is bullshit.
The saddest people don't try hard at anything.
They just DO feel absolutely worthless.
Sadness does not come with self sacrifice or selflessness.
Often times comes with stagnation.
Robin Williams was not depressed.
He had incurable degenerative alzheimers and committed suicide because he was doomed and didn't want to live to deteriorate further.Fuck this picture
you should go ahead and just do it
i guess so.
look for me on periscope in 10 min
My debit card isn't compromised though, only the hosting account it's linked to.They're only callable on certain weekdays
ah i misunderstood.Sorry m8 cant help you, i have no idea.
