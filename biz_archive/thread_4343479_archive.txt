Wtf is wrong with me!!!
I bought back to BTC..... And now BCH is mooning... Should I hold or buy in while I can into BHC???
buy in right now OP, its your last chance.I just bought in and im about to strap in for a wild rocket ride.
It's either now or you fucking kick yourself in the head forever for missing up on this rise.
do not buy dont be stupid dont fomo
you should buy before we hit .4 when asia wakes up.
>bchNOOOO
ah yes the reverse moon
Trying to play this current BTC-BCH shiftest is financial suicide.Either hedge your bets, pull out of crypto altogether, or just go all-in on a coin you have 99% faith in.I did the latter, and I'm sleeping like a babby.
1.5% since open>we mooningkek

Well you may shill or or denie it, but the fact that it's rising cant be denied.
