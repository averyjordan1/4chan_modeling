Any suggestions (other than Coinbase) for an exchange good for quick funding with US credit cards?
I typically buy in 1000 USD chunks.I use Gemini as well, but they dont take credit cards, I have to do a wire transfer which can take about 24 hours.
I'm looking for another quick "impulse buy" / seize the moment type for fast buys.
Coinbase was working well (instant buys with my US credit cards) but now I'm stuck in that infinite "you must visit coinbase.com/ssn for further verification" blah blah loop and their support never answers me.Any other exchanges like this around?Thx!Thx
look at that YELLOW, right, under-toe.G R O S S.
Agreed.
Sorry about that.
Didn't open the full pic, was just browsing my thumbnails looking for one that was blue board approved.
btw, try using localbitcoin, if you are about that life.
