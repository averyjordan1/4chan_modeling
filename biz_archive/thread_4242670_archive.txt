holy crap real life whale watching
saw a whale eat the top on POWR yesterday he must be ready to end it right now
Saw that too, was pretty convinced it was a whale eating mostly his own whales to dump even more coins on a second trend down.I still fucking held though like a retard.
I'm getting just so hard.
so i just set up a binance account(I have been using bittrex), and the 'candlesticks view' is a solid line.. how do I go about changing it or am I just missing something stupid?
Thanks

Literally watched 3 of these 60+ btc buys happen around 70k sats yesterday tooHeard a rumor that there's big whalepools in on this coin, they are actually getting angry at any whales in the group who are letting it go high before they've finished accumulatingspooky
These buys were literally about 30 minutes apart eachabout 1.5mil total bought up approximatelyGetting ready to ride the wave like the lil WTC cuttlefish I am after the fork
Interesting.
