From Japanese twitter.If there was ever a reason to go all in on a coin it was this cutie.
Tell me about this coinWhat makes it a solid investment?
It is only the third crypto on the Japanese market.
The other two (MONA and OmiseGO) did extremely well because the Japs are nationalistic.
Check the archive an read their whitepaper for more information
there's literally shitcoin named animecoin
unironically thisi know it seems stupid to invest in something purely because of its intended audience, but the japanese are leading the crypto revolution at the moment, with the exit of chinaif this does even half of what Mona did, then you are in for serious gains at this point.
Pls make fewer threads.

well thats why im buying itit has fundamentals, its a better Steembut at the end of the day, a lot of altcoins promise to be something usefulif you think Steem deserves to be top 50, then ALIS will surely surpass it, because japs are way more into crypto than whites.
What frickin exchange
Why donâ€™t you take 5 seconds to do a quick search, faggot?Just check CoinMarketCap.
You know how STEEM is trying to be a cryptocurrency for media stuff like written articles and video content?
Alis is basically a Japanese version of that.
Personally, I think those Cryptocurrency are going to increase in value as ad dollars for media dries up.
Fuck it.
