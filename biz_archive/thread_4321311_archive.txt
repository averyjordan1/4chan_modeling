HST On EtherDelta right now selling for about 0.0005 ETH.
In the next 2 weeks to be added to 2 more exchanges (Kucoin?Binance?).
Seen it when some random pajeet started shilling it and took a look into it myself and its pretty damn legit.
i suggest u DYOR.
AS for EPY, well who knows but the young faggot pajeets seem to be shilling that shit like their false masculinity in real life so it might be another CFD or something.
But do take a look at HST for your own good.P.S.
I have my whole portfolio split between those 2, 70% HST, 30% EPY.
with entries at 0.000585 ETH and 0.000880 ETH.
So yes, i am also looking for moral support as i already lost but i do have a good feeling about them.
I also invested in hst at .00058.
How many times will we see this go up by you think?
How many sat on yobit?
token supply?
