What happens when BCH forks in a few hours?
Half will be moved into the fork, some into BTC.
BCH as it is will crash badly, this was predicted by the plan leaked a month ago.
where is the proof of this plan?
Miners will flood back into BCH.
Jihan included this time.
Expect a 90% hash for BCH, 2 week transaction times and mass panic for BTC.
I'm so glad my tx got confirmed this morning and i'm finally free from the bch/btc death trap.
What did you swap it for?
