Alright /biz/ I got suckered into buying 2 asic rigs a while ago, and they finally arrived, I am out a dickload of money, but it wasn;t anything I wasn't prepared to lose.
Anyways, I can't sell them, becuase they're about 50% below retail value, but, would it be better to use multipool and keep the coins I mine in hopes they 10x, or just use nicehash, and get a little back in bitcoin over time, electricity is not a factor.
Thanks lads, and for your sake, don't fall for the mining meme.
p-pls reply

Mining is awesome, try whattomine com
Thanks anon, I'll check it out.
mine until 2020 or 21, sell and be happy
BCH looks most profitable atm.
Mine that or LTC
I'm hoping that these tiny profits will, in the future, be worth some decent money.
I'd MUCH rather be mining with a scypt or sha256 asic, but I got mega JUSTed, and have 2 X11s.
ah my new asics finally arrived>take picture>sell new asics online to anon>box up old asics and ship to ??
?>plug in new asics and start mining>profit margin drops>order new asics>ah my new asics arrive>ship old asics to anon>sell new asics to ???
how much were the miners?
Just wondering
Fucking Jihan Joo
I want to kill myself when I think about it, spent 1 BTC in total, .5 per miner shipping included.If I had held bitcoin it would be worth nearly 2x what I spent.
shit.
I guess just mine dash then.
~5 dollars a day right now per miner.
hopefully it goes up for you over time.
good luck
That's the plan.Hopefully the crypto market goes 2-3x in the next couple of years, and makes this all worth while.
OF course, if that happens, my other investments will far outprofit the mining.
