Who else got bizzed and went all in at .27 on BCH?
Before all this turmoil we where at 7k in buttcoin thinking we caught a dip but no the market went full retard.We should probably just hold and not trade for another year, it might tank back to 600 but we accept it easy come easy go hopefully someday it'll go through another pump right lads?
