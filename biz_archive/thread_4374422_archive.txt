Bitcoin is still the number one crypro to use on the darkmarket.
What coin will takes it's place in the future: dash, zcash, or monero?
None of them

Probably Dash desu.
although it is not as private as Monero or Zcash, it is putting in a lot more effort to get adoption by normies, they have good governance model through masternodes that enforces SOME decentralization, a proper serious CEO and working smartphone app.
And starting to be used as actual currency in Zimbabwe/VenezuelaMonero is too autistic and Zcash while being very professional and offing assurances of privacy has the Achilles heel of being highly centralized
I was leaning towards dash, too.
Thanks for this.
Any answer that is not Monero is either a troll or a retard.
The only reason Bitcoin is still being used is its liquidity and the lack of multisig in Monero (which should be implemented very soon).
this
DOGE
yeah, because normies are the people who shop in dnms.did you forget to take your autism pills today?
lack of multisig in MoneroMind spoonfeeding me what this means?I'm long on XMR but have no clue about the specifics of technology.
Any indication we'll have a fork shitshow like Bitcoin at some point?
