Working prototype in about 2 weeks and then it'll hit Binance.
Potentially huge, I don't intend to hold it for long though.
Selling at 1.5x-2.5x depending on the trend
Not selling until it hits 50m marketcap at least, and even then maybe not.
Confido is really easy for even brainlets to understand and the appeal for holding it is very clear cut as well.
This is one of those coins that could reach 100m+ very fast if there's just enough awareness about it.
literal who exchangesLOL
Five exchanges, not bad for 3 weeks in
Why can't LINK solve the exhange problem?
Fuck the oracle
Confido confirmed for being the solidest dev team going
While I love the honesty and humbleness of the team, these shit exchanges are the final nail in Confido's coffin.It was a P&D.
It is just an app that every decent sized company can develop themselves within weeks.The devs see that but the pajeets are deluted
Is it true that CFD cannot be listed on bittrex due to being considered a security?
It issues dividends therefore it's a security, so yes.
How is it different from, say, NEO, where NEO rewards GAS for holding NEO, which (GAS) in turn can be sold for profit and re-investing in NEO.
No troll, generally curious.
CFD issues dividends of its profits, NEO is proof of stake
Hilarious how Confido already did more work than Link for exchanges
lol you're delusionalquality over quantity
