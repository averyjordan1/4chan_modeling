FOMO IS HARDDDDDDDDDD SAVE ME /BIZ FROM NOT BUYING NEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's high so buy now
There will be a major announcement either today or on Monday.
If it's minor, the price will decrease a little and will come back up to around $100 in a few months.
Literally nothing to lose.
You decide OP.
The question is, why wouldn't you buy NEO right now?
The NEO devs never post anything, this is the first time in their lives they post a countdown to something big.
So you can bet IT IS SOMETHING BIG.And even if it goes down a little after the announcement, NEO has a lot of great things coming this and next month, it's gonna easily hit AT LEAST $100 before January.
Or you can just buy some BAT, last chance before all the YouTubers buttfrustrated about demonetization collectively discover that someone has made them an unmoderated sidechannel revenue stream.
