This article predicts Ripple price 1USD by 2017 and 2USD by 2018 https://www.profitconfidential.com/cryptocurrency/ripple/xrp-price-forecast-14-nov-builds-strength/This was retweeted by Ripple CEO https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/930896248961359873
1$ by the end of this year seems possible!
lmao
$1 by January is definitely within the realm of possibility.
Unfortunately, watching literal shitcoins shoot up to $10, $50, and even $100 for no reason, $1 or $2 is just a little disappointing.
I m not trying to Shill I am giving opinion and I know how 4chan works
Agree!
But keeping in mind the circulating supply this seems reasonable growth
forecasts a 100% centralized $10 billion coin gaining an extra $30 billion in a month> totally not shilling, you guys
that would make its market cap like 30 billion.
No fucking way will that happen
Ripple speaks to an industry that is worth trillions of dollars.
Anything is possible.
the xrp coin literally has zero purpose though.
"institutional money" or whatever meme people here come up with is going to flow into the company directly, only crypto pajeets will buy this coin.
really shows how easy it is to make money of this retarded market.
Then tell me all the purposes BTC has that XRP doesnt.I will buy back in at 0.2 before the rocket ride
$1 on 31 dec 2017, $2 on 1 jan 2018lol
Ripple just reminds me of how underappreciated Stellar is.Both coins have a golden future ahead of them.
no fagsno agency with billions of dollars will ever put any assets into the coin itself and benefit a sea of bagholders.
Someone have Ripple Rick on a transparent background?
