who here /one in ten thousand/ (100k+ LINK club)
My net worth is 558k LINK and 18k DICE, for better or worse.
What sucks is at one point I had 1100 ETH when it was $420.
So many things I could have done better at this point, but despite all the FUD going around, I'm a big believer and willing to wait patiently.
It will moon one day, but I realize that could be 12-18 months from now.
“gotta wait 18 months til I‘m a Multimillionaire, holy shit waiting sucks“
Yes zir.
*gasps* *wheezes* I’m in this bitch.
>bragging about being the guy with the biggest bag of shit
14k here.
I'm making it right?
