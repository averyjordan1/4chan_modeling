If TA isn't real then how did I call this for my normie friend who wants to buy on coinbase?
Conventional TA is dodgy with crypto because it's different from stocks.
It's open 24/7, unregulated, full of bots, anonymous, newish.
Definitely doesn't mean it can't work at times.
gj getting the call right
