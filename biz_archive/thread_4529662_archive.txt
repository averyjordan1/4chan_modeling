Top volume imminent.
Faux Satoshi and Roger The Criminal Ver will save meeeeeeeee!You're being scammed.
You're buying a centralized shitcoin.
We just hit 0.2
bitcoin core is the centralized shit coin that will soon slow down to a haltEnjoy your digital gold, literally shit you can't move around because it weighs like a ton of bricksBCH will be used to actually transact while your "gold" turns into worthless bags.
If BTC doesn't live, BCH won't take over from it.
If the market sees a coin can't remain king forever, it will search for an appropriate replacement, not some garbage that was birthed by criminals and liars and is essentially a copy pasta of BTC.
