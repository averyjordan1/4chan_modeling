Do your own research before you buy something.
At least check what the name means.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BancorI hope every single person who 'invested' in Bancor looses everything.
The coin does exactly what it was supposed to do.
I really hope /biz/ memed this jewcoin to abyss

I'm holding a pretty heavy bag of this shite.
I would take a hefty loss if I sold now.
But it seems to be really active.
Lots of projects are partnering with bancor.
And once they release their platform to the public I can see it getting some traction.
