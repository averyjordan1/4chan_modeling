Hey /biz/, I have a miner up and running that gives me a steady income of 1.3 ETH per month, should I:- leave it there- buy BTC (mostly to hold)- buy shitcoins (trying some short term bullshit)
mine monero

now it's optimized for eth, mostly nvidia gpus, tried zcash but that wasn't worth it
% in BTC30% in shitcoins
Sell NVidia, buy AMD for CryptoNight
