Woah, USDT got hacked.
Guess I'll play it safe and sell all of my BTC and all other crypto I have into fiat and cash out.
my loss I'll come back after the dip is over and pay all the transaction, credit card and bank fees all over again, but I don't mind because my profits will make up for it.lol jk.
kiss my sweaty ballz.
I'll never let them have my BTC
