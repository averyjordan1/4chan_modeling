What is the minimum amount of ETH to make it?
what does it mean "to make it"?
depends on your wants and where you live, which is almost always unstated in these threads, rendering them pointless.report, sage.

You might get a measily 2x in half a year if ur lucky
so just not being born a retard
If we're talking financial independence, I would say $1-2M is what you want.
And giving us a timespan of let's say 5 years, I think ETH will be worth around ... let's say $5k.
You're gonna want about 200 ETH.
But the more ETH you own, the closer you get to financial independence and being a millionaire.Buy and hold for 5 years, it's a long ass time, but ETH is going to make it so there's very little risk.

I got 3.255764 is that respectable?
You're not getting financial independence with $1k worth of ETH dude.
Maybe a downpayment on a house in 5 years.
Just keep hodling, the longer you wait the more valuable it becomes.
