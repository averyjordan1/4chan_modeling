>bought LINK at $0.47>sold LINK at $0.16Fuck you guys, you told me there is still one week before the fork.
You fags were fudding LINK so hard.
you actually believed it?
I don't understand why you would sell ANYTHING at a loss unless you REALLY needed the money to live or the project is 100% dead.
Oh well...
makes incredibly stupid decision>blames someone elseUh huh.
he fell for the FUD
You do realise that LINK fudding, itself, is a meme right?You dont actually think that somethign with that much industry backing, shilling (by a 18.2 billion valued bank), headlining at the blockchain super conference, all the additional stuff, you surely didnt think it would fail....did you?Did you actually just get meme'd on the biggest crypto of 2018?
It's dumping to the ground.Look 425160842516084251608
buy high>sell low>...>profitYouâ€™re not shorting correctly
Wait so the fudding was a meme too????
fuck you guys so much this shit wasnt in knowyourmeme.com
this is when we tell you, "why'd you sell?
You didn't know the fork would be called off?
BTFO"
You probably should have done your own research or read the pastebin or looked at how constant and intense the FUD was.
You sold the very people fudding your bags at a discount.Enjoy being poor because you listed to some retard lying out of his ass.
oh geez better sell at a loss again!!
No it isnt you stupid fuck.
If it was dumping i would be buying back in quickly.
You and i are in the same boat.

Kek this is how /biz/ periodically purges newfags, we operate on so many layers of irony only /biz/raelis know what's truly worth buying.>Is BCH good?>Satoshis vision>Scam chinkcoin>LINK>Literally the future of all crypto>Literally a p'n'dWhich is it newfag
Just dropped this shit.I might buy when it double bottoms again
OP is based
You do realise that LINK fudding, itself, is a meme right?Nigger that only goes for Ark.
Bancorcucks and DGBmarines get the same treatment as Linktards.
The FUD is just funny because it's true.
Ark FUD is funny because it's ironic.
