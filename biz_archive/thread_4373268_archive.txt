The market is finally seeing some stable, normal growth?Could this be?
?No BTC fork drying the altcoins?No ShitcoinCash threatening to destroy crypto land?Could this be happening??
Don't get comfortable, anon.
There will probably be some more news to spook the market by thur or fri
Get ready to dump your alt to go in ETH.ETH will be rewarded, time to shine.
don't tell me thattell me the opposite
my portfolio actually going up guys
USD down, (so it's pair) EUR is up.
I expect this is the rising tide that has pushed up all crypto.
China will announce they're opening government-OKd exchanges and the total market cap will double overnight
can i plz believe this?
>normal growth
it means BCH about to be pumped again bringing back chaos, confusion and an army of pink wojaks who sold their bch at loss to recover in alts only to lose more
Yeah can we maybe not do that?maybe do something else?
it's inevitable, moving to cash is the only way to avoid it in coming months
Yeah babyyyyUp 12% past two days
Hard to believe as well after all this cocksuckery.
Even though Link is still not moving my other stuff somewhat recovered.But I expect a BTC rally to 7500$+ desu and some alt holocausting in the wake of it.
Literally like all the last times doing nothing and waiting was the better choice.
So will be the next time because in all those attempts to "take over" those assholes are just trying to increase their BTC stack.
