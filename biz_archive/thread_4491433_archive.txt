Buy Chancoin while it is below $1 mark and you will make up for all the loses you have had and +1000% ROI on top.

there are people who expect it to be bigger than btc which is fun to see
Tfw bought last night on hitbtc planning to sell on bittrex to take advantage of that sweet 15% arb opportunity>Cocksuckers at Hitbtc take forever to process my withdrawal, it ultimately gets cancelled for no apparent reason>Try again>Wait for about 30 minutes before saying "fuck it it's 6 AM I'm going to bed">Wake up to see that the transfer finally went through but it's down by like 20% on bittrex>Sell at like a 10% lossFucking Hitbtc pajeets.
That site sucks such cock, I'm never using it again unless I need a coin that absolutely can't be found anywhere else.
Bittrex i find is good exchange.
Yeah bittrex is pretty good.
But basically anything that actually works is good in comparison to shitbtc
There will be one more pump tonight to 600+
