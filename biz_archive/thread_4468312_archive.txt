Seems like a good investments guys.
Any into to this coin?
It supposedly has VISA partnership, can anyone confirm?Their ios app looks pretty slick and makes me want to throw a few thousand at ot.Opinions?
its a fucking prepaid card just like monaco had
it's the same shit, they're all prepaid cards with a fancy design
How so?
there are over 100 provideres in the USA for a visa debit card linked to a bitcoin wallet that has instant transactions you can use anywhere visa is acceptedYour shitcoin is a scam, faggot
It will go x5 in the next week.
New money always gets wet for tenX.
i'm pretty heavy in tenx, it's a solid coin, I see $5 by spring 2018
Why even ask this when all the FUDders will just say no?
Marketcap tooo high.
I rather buy something similar like TokenCard with 80% smaller Marketcap.
It has shit conversion rates, they claim 0% fees or low fees, but you end up paying insane high amounts for fees/conversion.
Also, the token is definately a security which means big exchanges will delist it soon.
That's why Mona.co removed the asset contract functionality from the token... TenX will have some real legal issues soon.
I am in the whitelist for a MVP card from them, also reserved a MCO black card from ICO.TenX has bad tech and bad lawyers, which is why they had all their cards outside EU deactivated a few months ago, they are totally incompetant, also the CEO has dabbled in quite a few pyramid schemes
HAHAHAHA NICE FUD FAGGOT IM SURE YOU SOLD EARLY AND ARE HOPING TO GET IN CHEAP
haha have never owned PAY and never will, even their CEO says it's a bad investment as only 0.5% of the fees are transferred to the contract within.
Do you know how much needs to be transacted for the contract to be worth what PAY is worth today?
We are talking billions of dollard, but i dont expect pajeets on biz to actually do some due dilligence, so go ahead and buy that pipedream m8
Also, that card is ugly as shit>JOIN THE REVOLUTION HURR DURR IM MR HACKERMAN
