I would gladly watch all my crypto go to zero if it meant Bitcoin died and alts weren't held to the retarded ancient piece of garbage anymore.
$15 fucking transaction fees and a 150k transaction backlog.
That shit is no longer fit for purpose, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when people genuinely try and defend it when if any coin came out as crippled as BTC already is and actually did something halfway useful in addition we would all call it a shitcoin and it would fail.
Why do you care about the tech bro, that shit is like gold.The tech is in ethereum blockchain and linkchain
Gold is the laziest claim.
My fecal matter is like gold if I can trick people into using it to trade.
But at some points people need to realize it's not actually a good idea to use my literal shit as their store of value when there are many options that are literally better in every way.
People Own bitcoin because it's a get rich quick scheme, not to use it as a currency.
That's a classic bubble, hell even marx pointed out the M-C-M fallacy in Capital.
You are very stupid
