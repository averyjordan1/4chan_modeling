I dont get it.
Picture perfect pattren, looks like it would have been the perfect short entry and it didnt work.
I dont get it u guys.
Ive made a lot of bad trades doing what I thought was right.
Can someone teach me how to buy off support and sell off resistance?
I feel like everytime I try to buy off support it is when the momentum is already dead and I'm basically catching a falling knife
applying ta to crypto has way less probability as opposed to forex/stocks.
markets just have way too much manipulation and volatility at this stage.
try a more fundamental approach and add ta as confluence.
btc's in a strong uptrend on every single candle with no sign of slowing down, dunno why'd you bother shorting it.
use the following indicators:>Tom Demark (TD 9 buy/sell 13 countdown)>Stoch RSI>trade on 4 hour candles>Chart patterns (like in your pic)
so according to 4 hour chart, this is a bull flag right?
Still bullish?
When would you start considering the trend has shifted to bearish, would the current red candle need to engulf the green one?Everyone tells me to zoom out on the chart but the problem with using 4 hour candles is you miss big moves, a 4 hr big candle can be several hundred dollars
No, you get to see big moves on the 4hr chart.
You missed the breakout.Using the TD indicator and 4hr candle I was able to see the bottom (there was a TD 9 on the candle).
Granted, I didnt buy but that was the bottom.Right now I dont see another buy opportunity.
I would wait for a better entry.
Others are also calling this a dead cat bounce.
FOMO buying is shit, i've messed up way too much doing it.
Protip: Stop believing in astrology.
you can use different time frames.
I'd always look at the monthly, weekly, daily, 4hr first.
Look for long term trades.
ya im not trying to fomo buy, I know thats bad here.
Then on the other hand people always say "trade with the trend" so it would be bad to try and short this bull run.
There seems to be always conflicting advice
