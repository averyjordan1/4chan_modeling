>NULS COMMUNITY UPDATEThere's going to be another pump at the end of this week.
Take advantage of this early signal or eat grit for Christmas.
luls
Bought at $0.15, sold at $6.50 before you faggots started shilling.
I was having fun.
Just put 1 ETH in this.
Indeed.
It never went to $6.50
Sold at $6.50, lol fucking when was it $6.50?
YOu mean $0.65?
lol idiota
Shill me on this coin anons.
I know they have a solid team, some govt suppurt and a new website coming in a few days but is this it?
This is a $20 coin son.
I think this should be enough to convince.
But what makes it a 20$ coin?

OBOR
If the circulating supply is 40 million then this takes us to a similar market cap as OMG.
I guess this is possible.
Everything you have mentioned, plus strong project and low market cap and only 40,000,000 supply.
Answer yourself this.
How much is 800,000,000 in a crypto world?
Isnt OBOR supposed to be fully "implemented" by 2049?
By 2049 half of china will be using nuls as blockchain solution.
This makes sense.
I wonder what the Chinese themselves are thinking of NULS
It's only $15,000 for this coin to be at $1.00 again.
One "small" investment and we are there.
Fuck that.
Buy, bitch bastird.
It will get you rich.
They fuck up on coin marke cap, the total supply is 100.000.000.
Confirmed days ago on Telegram.100 milions, 60 milions circulating supply, I guess.
Still good numbers anyway.
Did you read AMA part 2?
This is not close to official.
,000,000 once main net is active son.
ERC20 is only 40,000,000
So guys, is this something that will spike?
should I sell everything and unironically buy 100k ?
Do it
Do it, YOLO
this could be worth 500,000 by end of the week.
