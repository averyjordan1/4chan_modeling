Better tell Binace and the government of Singapore they're getting scammed, I feel bad for those guys.
Whats your programming experience?How many minutes you've spent researching the code?
I'm guessing less than 10 since it was just made public.
Exactly.
I swear sometimes the stupidity of anon is astounding.
Your FUD post was based on their Github being empty, that is no longer true and had been pointed out immediately prior to your own shitpost.
You've made a fool of yourself accept it and move on.
they have a 15 member team too holy shit
Poor fud attempts ^

On /biz/ Chinamen exist in a state of perpetual sleep; the threat of their finally waking hanging like the sword of Damocles over our gains.
how do the master nodes work?
Sold all my WTC
its a dividend 10% per year
WHO GIVES A SHIT IF THEY FOLLOW REGULATION, THEY ARE NOT GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED PPL WHO BUYING IN FOR THIS ARE GOING TO GET FUCKED HARD
LITERALLY THE SECOND ANSWER ON THE AMA FAGGOT!
DO YOU HAVE READING PROBLEMS?
Approx 10k nulls for a masternode.
The more you put in after that, the more return you'll get.Somebody said 10% per year, I'm unable to find the source of that at the moment.
You may need to confirm that, because if it is true... :O.
OFFICIAL SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTdude cmon.
all they said was they are following the laws in singapore and that singapore generally supports blockchain technology
From the reddit AMAWill there be master nodes?
And if so, any comment of how many NULS are needed to run it?In order to help ensure the safety of the network, the minimum requirement of around 10,000 Nuls is used for collateral, the more which is put up for collateral the more profit the operational node will receive.
