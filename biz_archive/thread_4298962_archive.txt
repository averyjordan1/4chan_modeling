There's no reason that with the power of 4chan just as we did in Q1 we cannot make this coin go 10x from here into 2018.
We are the meme masters.
Example = Ethereum at $300 is like getting in on Bitcoin when it was $1,300.
Not to mention OMG's price potential https://youtu.be/GgoLeTN26ZoRemember BCH is not on normie exchanges only Ethereum is so we need to push ETH not BCH.
Get with the times, Grandpa.
Link is the /biz/ memecoin now.
