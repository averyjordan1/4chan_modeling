I'm Australian.
I'm sick of working for the man in my shitty 9-5 job.
My ex gfs parents owned motels and I actually helped out a lot and helped them run the business and quite liked it and am thinking of maybe buying my own.
How's it work?
Can just anyone get a business loan?
Or do I have to have a deposit etc....
