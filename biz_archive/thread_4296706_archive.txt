emphy.io15 million supply10 centsnot on CMC (being listed some day soon says dev in telegram)team with Ph.D's and no pajeetseasiest 10x ive ever been a part of, helping fellow biz bros.I did 6x on confido and 3x on NIO past few days, this is easily next.
I got another gem after this that etherdelta didnt even announce yet, but im still accumulating that one.
done accumulating this one, but giving you guys the chance before the norms who browse CMC's "New" tab get to it
not even a single mention of what the coin does
t.pajeet
does it matter what it does?
look at every single etherdelta coin that pumps.. MOD DOVU POWR CFD NIO, who gives a fuck.
they all pump up, then you sell at the top.
thats all that matters.
no one gives a shit anymore.
picture a normie seeing a new coin on coinmarketcap with 15,000,000 total supply at 10 cents.
they are going to cum in their pants and go buy the book.
i can just about guarantee it.
