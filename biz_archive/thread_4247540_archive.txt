Of all the taxes, income tax is the best form of tax!
It's the most progressive!
It's anti-poor!
In places without income tax, they tax regressive tax rates, and even indirect taxes that benefit the rich (who spend less money on VAT related shit, for example) rather than the poor!
Fuck off we are full.
I live in Florida and definitely pay income tax.

tbqh income tax is the least infuriating kind of taxSales taxes / capital gains taxes are commie kike garbage though

Capital gains tax is just a lower rate income tax for certain types of income.

Regressive taxes are good.
If niggers stopped spending money on new iPhones and TVs every year and only spend it on necessities like food, then they would pay no sales tax at all.
You will be shocked to see your progressive tax still exceeds 35%
Indirect Consumption related taxes go deeper than just buying shit, anon.
