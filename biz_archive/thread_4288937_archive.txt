Goodbye bros.
I had the best times of my pathetic, failed NEET life here and I fucking love you all.
I lost a lot of money and pissed off a lot of people so I am taking the cowards way out.
When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.
I love you all.

Nah bro, I'm bargaining my BTC for BCH without crashing the markets.
You can still piss of more people.Anyway off to the r9k
Sell it so it doesn't get lower?Also I'm thinking of cashing out on my dip too.
I just keep losing money and it's not going well.
I think I learn my lesson and I find something new and dumb to do.
I'm not even working right now and I thought I wouldn't be happy with not making money, now I'm losing quarters of a year of paychecks instead.
Well, why not play safe bets on crypto and use cash you dont really mind alot losing?
