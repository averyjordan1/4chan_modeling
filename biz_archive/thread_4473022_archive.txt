Or I'm going to kill mysefl, I sold MTL few days ago.
It's going down, so I guess it was a FOMO buying, but if it's really MTL, Teeka is a dirty pajeet scammer, this coin does nothing rather than going down, twice as fast as other coins while dumping, even when there are good news, like Alpha release on October 30th.Don't even mind to hold this shitcoins, you will be dumped hard by old owners.
it was a PnD
Yea it looks like they were intentionally posting fake posts to catch people that were trying to steal.
But their website fucked up at the same time.
They just dumped on their own subscribers.
I wouldn't want to be answering phones tomorrow.
