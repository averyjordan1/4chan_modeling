Am I the only one who feels like the biztards who invest more than 10K seem to be going to the moon while poorfags are getting justed?Is it because the poorfags have weak hands and can't afford to lose leading to emotional trades?
Pic related, it's a poorfag getting justed
I'm a poorfag and I'll admit I FOMO a lot.
I'm desperate to increase my stack so I make kneejerk decisions based on emotion and chasing the $$$.
A richfag doesn't need to trade based on emotion or chase FOMO.
He's in comfy coins like BTC, ETH, NEO and XMR.I chased all those stupid Teeka fake picks and lost $8k.
A richfag wouldn't even be on /biz chasing pajeet picks.
Good luck man, I hope you can make it after learning from your mistakes
