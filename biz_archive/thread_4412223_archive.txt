The best time to buy Ripple is NOW !!!
Why?
(I'm currently holding some)
ok grandpa
No, the best time to buy it is below $0.17.
This is the most boring but predictable coin ever.
Buy below $0.17, sell when it pumps to $0.25 before it crashes back down.
Easy

You're leaving money on the table by not taking advantage of predictable price swings that keep repeating
Already priced in after the pump yesterday
I bought it when it was 0.2, .22 the gains are minimal....
I am getting in now because I am awaiting the big leap forward....
