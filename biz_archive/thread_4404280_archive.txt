Asking for a friend.
This is the shittiest coin I have ever seen in my lifesage
POSW because of rebranding, TPOS, and masternodes.
ARK because of new core update and mobile wallets.

BUY WANCHAIN NOW.
Oh no just wait till it hits exchanges, its better than ripple,stelar,chainlink,bankera,omisego together.
already launching mainet in dec while most other coins take several months or years.....look it up ex factom team with a more scalable project.
Yes the team that did more than 250x with factom, that is 1k into 250k... Also Zen end to end priv not like monero and zcash and nav...
Also Wanchain sold like in 7 min WITH NO MARKTING AT ALL not overhiped like the others (you know who you are) also dont buy from ED that might not be exchangable for Wancoins.
Search it on Yandex
no but Wancoins bought in exchanges right now are not exchangable for wancoins according to the team.
You should ask their telegram mods.Anyways its gonna rocket IMO could go higher than factom in a lesser time.No marketing at all, and they have a guy in their team with conections to The New York Times, Bloombers, Wall Street Journal and many more.They have an ex Chinesse Politician, Bussness Moguls, Phds in Eliptical crypto, etc.
you got a source to that?
