And that's why EVERYONE HATES fucking bcash, thanks for destroying the alt bullruns
If you arent holding a handful of bch to hedge against core difficulty adjustment you are a brainlet.
>hatedon't invest based on emotions
holding 1:1 btc bch but bch is so bad for everyone
Crypto has no room for emotion.
Get with it, or be left behind.The true king will reign.
Yes, there are PLENTY of excellent alts...but it just isn't their time in the spotlight right now.
It is a battle between BTC and BCH.
If you haven't placed your bet on which one you believe is the true Bitcoin...be prepared to watch your investments bleed.Not that it matters, but I'm betting on BCH.
Choose wisely, anon.
Yeah, sure, blame BitCoin Cash.
Not Blockstream, Segwit, or proposed off chain transactions.
It's like you haven't even been paying attention.
i cashed out yesterdayi wanted to buy up BCH but that shit is too volatile despite knowing that it will pump and BTC will nose dive.
i still am too weak to buy into BCH.
so once the dust settles i'll return to the shire and buy up Ripio, POWR, BAY and XMLI might turn some profits into OMG but we'll see how it does
are you a retard?
I made 25k with xmr, ardr & nxt in the last couple days.>it just isn't their time in the spotlight right nowkek
Anyone who isn't holding 1:1 only has themselves to blame.Date of the fork wasn't secret, people had plenty of time to withdraw from exchanges.Also BCH is good for crypto.
forces you to cashout because everything could drop 70-80 % good for cryptochoose one
Long term healthy development of crypto is more important than your short term lambo millionare dreams.
