So unlike most of you I've done my research, and realised something.Metaverse have already circumnavigated the China ICO ban.By their partnership with Draper Dragon and their Digital Asset fund, ETP is able to create ICO like launches, using "VC" funds to kickstart.This shows the type of strategic and capable business minds at ETP.
This is brilliant.
To be successful, a business must adapt.
This is exactly what they've done and the market hasn't realised yet.The China ban is nothing for ETP, and you'll see that in the next few weeks.
