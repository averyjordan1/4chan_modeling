In pre-sale at the moment.
Seems promising.
Holy shit, I had no idea this existed.
Thanks for sharing this OP.
Yeah I don't hear much about them, I found them at World Blockchain Conference this year - they sponsored it so their logo was everywhere.
It seems like Tezos + EtherDelta.
I think their tech is great, but this needs to be more visible for me to feel comfy with it.
I did some quick research and the tech seems amazing.
$30 million is a small cap for what they're doing.
Still have no idea what their token does and I'm in the process of reading their WP but holy shit I have a feeling that this will be the next 10-20x.
Shill more fags
I'm not shilling it, not yet.
I'm just genuinely happy I found this.
I mean do your own research, look at their website and tell me this isn't going to be huge.
