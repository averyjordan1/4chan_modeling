Check out this thread from last monthhttps://warosu.org/biz/?task=search2&ghost=&search_text=confido&search_subject=&search_username=&search_tripcode=&search_email=&search_filename=&search_datefrom=&search_dateto=&search_op=all&search_del=dontcare&search_int=dontcare&search_ord=old&search_capcode=all&search_res=postWhy the fuck was Confido working with and actively shilling for Chainlink?
Oh boys finally see a pattern, cant trust these eastern European.
It's like saying a bank is fraudulent because one if their potential customers scammed people.Link was incredibly popular here when Confido appeared out of nowhere.
They changed their white paper to include Link to try and get in on the popularity and sell their shit.
There are literally hundreds of posts by people claiming how great Chainlink is because Confido is using it
Not even, look at the actual posts, people are all mentioning Confido as a way to hype Chainlink
The plot thickens.
We were the targets for this scam.
We are obsessed witu Chainlink and are often the ones buying into ICOs early.
Itd make sense for them to adopt Link as their platform & then shill it to us.
Confido would have been a successful project if they didn't fuck up with their NDA.
The founder goofed and now the entire project suffers.
They certainly are.
It doesn't change the fact Confido said they were going to use Link at the time because it was already popular.
Don't confuse the timeline.
Bingo.
Confido scam => Chainlink scam => Request scam
