Sooooo what was the actual neo news guys..?
partnerships and 500k dapp competition.
So think this is the new floor regarding the news?
standard poodles are unironically the best doggos
a developer contest or some irrelevant bullshit3 years of bag holding await you
-42 is floor for neo in general
Sorry to disappoint but I actually sold at the top.
Just curious what happens from here on out
