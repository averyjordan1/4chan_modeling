VTC halving 12 december if u aint in by then u are a fucking retard and deserve to be poor
i been buying the dips and selling the tips, keep accumulating more.
can the real vertbois please stand up?
Looks like a larp wall.
priced it.buy grs, it also has ASIC resistance but 10 more features.
Also, you can send grs via SMS.VTC will tank to 30k sats
there is absolutely no reason why VTC should go below 40K
Oh yes there is.
People realize VTC has a really strong community, but that's it.
Once they become bagholderes they'll abandon they sinking ship.
Believe me, if you want an ASIC resistant coin, read a little bit about grs, it's the better longterm hold + grs is only 8k sats right now.
no one can even pronounce grs fuck off with that shit coin
next year there is a vote about the rebrand.
that's the time you'll cry.
grs has been pumped and dumped too much already
