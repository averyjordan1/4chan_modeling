>LINK and CFD are working with one another >CFD biggest shitcoin of 2017 these are the people Sergey decides to collaborate with?

Now that comfydo has been confirmed as a scam, I think it's safe to say that Sergey was never even in contact with them and the CFD devs just name dropped LINK to inflate the price.
