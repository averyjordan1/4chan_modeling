Sadly it looks like this think didn't take off today.
Anyone hodling lomocoin?
Holding about 100k LMC -- not sure wtf this coins is doing, if anything, but I like bags so I'll keep holding.
I`m holding but heard its gonna go up soon
I mean it would seem to me like it is worth a lot more
Very low market cap means it has some nice room for growth if they can prove they are worth it.
A 1000% increase in MC is still sub 100 mil.
(which is a fuck ton, but not unheard of in this space).
Seems like a good project, team and devs.
The lucky ones are the ones who it at such a low price.
I paid 683, last I looked it was at 590.
I guess 850 is the point I would sell
I sold m,y bags today when I got impatient.I might buy a small bag if my trades go well.
Yeh I got some at 620.
I'm pretty confident we'll see some gains brah
not even the meme competition could save this
cryptoinsiderbitNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHAVE YOU FORESAKEN US!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No, BTC is just fucking everyones shit up, it will take longer than normal, I am holding my bags.
hey bro!i know this autistic battle is fucking everyone's shit up.
but LMC?
it feels like a bad bet.
how's the TA looking over there.
Looking decent so far, seems to be consolidating for a bit
But the volume is less than a third from yesterdaythe well is drying up, what do you think?
>tfw split my btc 60/40 in lmc/neo last night
Just be patient and hold.
Trust me, not a bad bet.
