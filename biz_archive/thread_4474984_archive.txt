what is this shit, every month, I lost 1btc in 5 sec.
looks like this chasing is not my game.
fuck off teeka
It's ok man, people lose far more.

If you chase then you have to be quick.
also just lost 0.00625 btc for fomoing into dash.
Glad I sold them early enough, 50$ loss is worth the lesson.
if you are to late for a pnd just chill in btc.
Try getting in a low index mutual fund to start safer homie
Lost 10% of my portfolio, thanks teeka

Stop playing this 'chase the pbc pick' game.
You think you're beating the uninformed to the gains.
You're not.
The uninformed are the uninformed.
Get it?
You're fighting the informed in a pump and dump.
pbc is a literal scam insider pump group.SEC is going to bust down that dirty pajeets door any day now
glad you only lost 10% unlike some niggas
Take responsibility for your own decisions.
You bought a known pump and dump, fully aware of what was happening, yet hoping to exploit someone else.
Instead, you got exploited.
Hopefully this serves as a lesson to check your greed and NOT BUY P&Ds.
Oldfagbiztard just started a BTC thread.
Get back in BTC and recover your losses tonight.
Yeah we need to spread the word that tweeka is a toxic investor only out for himself.
