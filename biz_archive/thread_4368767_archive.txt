Yesterday you didn't buy when it went live on bittrex because you were too lazy to do some researchYou complained that it didn't immediately pump like some shit coinYou know what, never mind, go buy some more LINK
500 sats by xmas
Yeah better avoid it then
I think it's amazing that tokens like Chainlink er endlessly memed here, meanwhile it's going sideways after losing a ton of it's value
only bought 1k at 3300 sats, waiting for it to come down to buy moar
I bought over 200k powr coins.
I'm fairly certain I'll be a millionaire in a few months.If the tesla news is real this coin will hit 10-15 dollar easily.
Because its not a pump and dump like this shitcoin and has top tier fundamentals?
holy shit good job anon
went all in @4000 sats, am i doomed?
smart anon
You'll thank yourself if you hold
Slowly buying the minimum transaction amount on binance, up to nearly 1.2k so far.
Comfiest hold ever
