Roger Ver and Jihan Wu are incredibly rich people with billions of dollars of invesment made in their coin.
Why don't they pay up and work with good PR firms?We see a lot of pajeet P&D shills here but they are working voluntarily for their Discord groups.
BCH shills are worse than them in quality, AND they get paid?
Seriously?How can an operation so big can't even find native speakers to shill?
Even their language is weird, let alone the arguments (or lack thereof).
