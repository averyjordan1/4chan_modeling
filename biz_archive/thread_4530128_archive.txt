is there a way to buy bitcoins with phone credit?
i'm too young to own a credit card and also i don't want my parents to know about my crypto life.
I can't mine with my shitty pc but i still want to try and join the game.
The fees on buying with a phone would be like 50% due to the risk of chargebacks by the phone companys.
Just do faucets and sites like earncrypto where you view ads for crypto.
Or if you are in the US, go buy an Amazon Gift Card with Cash, then get bitcoin for it on Paxful, they take a 20% fee.
% fees on paxful?
damn, that's a lothow much are the fees if you buy with a credit card?
where do you guys generally buy bitcoins?
coinbase?
