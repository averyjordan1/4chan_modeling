Now that the whitelist is over, who got into the next 10x ICO ?
I did, sir.
Many happy gainings are expecting on him
I did, I'm always weary of ICOs though so probably just going to throw in only 1 ETH
Didn't get in cause my passport is horribly outdated(expired back in 2001)
The dev team said you're allowed to obscure the info on your passport and just show your name and DOB.
Hard luck, dude.
Dang.
No presale bonus right?Might buy as soon as it hits the exchange...next year?
