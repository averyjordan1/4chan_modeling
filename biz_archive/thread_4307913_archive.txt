>poloniex has Gas but no Neo>bittrex has Neo but no Gaswhy is this?
ask them not me
NEO pays dividends in the form of GAS and I guess polo is careful not to list dividend paying crypto so they don't get fucked by the feds.Bittrex is stealing everyone elses gas and dumping it on other exchanges for millions of dollars, if they listed it this would have to end and they wouldn't make more money off trading fees to exceed all that sweet free gas.It actually amazes me people still use Bittrex to trade, but Binance's volume is getting higher and higher every day.
It will probably pass Bittrex by the end of the year.
