NEBULAS is going to be huge.
Mark my words.
I'm prob one of the 20 people in the world who perused their whitepaper AND yellowpaper.https://twitter.com/nebulasio/status/9310316521757900822.
LISK (LSK), rebranding comin up soon (scheduled to be Q4 2017 according to whitepaper)3.
AGRELLO (DLT), real use-case with 8+ developers.
A gold team with not so good PR so far.Done.
Take care.
Lisk is best, if partnership is confirmed on the 22nd expect at least 2X gains short term, not to mention the halving tomorrow.
not to mention the halving tomorrow.?
Started looking into Nebulas as it looked promising.
Problem though....Their circulating supply is only 5million but total supply is 100million.
The fuck is that about?
million tokens for founding team, locked for 3 years which is good, but 70 million tokens are just left as TBD which isnt great
