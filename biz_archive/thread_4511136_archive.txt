New core release confirmed no bugs so going to final release (0.12)AMD 1 click miner rumoured to be releasing in next 48hrs...Block halving...LOOK at this buy wall.
Fill your bags, this is gonna be a $20 coin by Xmas!
I'm mining about 6.5 a day currently.
Up to 1k VTC.
If this hits $20 I will fuck myself with a hot GPU.Realistically I'm hoping for a 2x in coin price shortly after halving to maintain current profit of $8k/year.
Oh fuck i should probably cancel my sell orders, this is a moon ride now.
4511235Still have lightning transfers, new iOS wallet, stealth addresses, exchanges to be added...Genuinely can see this being LTC $ level by end of Q2 2018!
