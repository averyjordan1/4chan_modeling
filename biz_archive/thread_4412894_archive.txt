I was already going to hold but this post made me want to buy even more.
Still below ico?
I canâ€™t believe this shit is still under ICOWtf happened to the alt market, honestly?I still remember when shitcoins like DGB pumped 80x because of a fucking random minecraft sever that like 3 people played.. those truly were the days
The days of x100 moon missions are over.What does REQ has so far?
A good whitepaper and a nice project idea.
The team is far off from an All star blockchain one.
No MVP, nor proof of concept so far.
Test Net will come EoY, from there we will look.
But right now this is more than a gamble.Threw in some bucks for the lulz
OMG is better
When moon?
https://github.com/RequestNetwork/Shit is happening.
And it's happening fast.
We will all make it, there is some serious market manipulation at play
Please.
Don't start like the LINK MarinesJust accept it, some github codes are nothing nowadys.>Muh price manipulation>Muh binance
So, what we have here:i) constant dev updates ii) very active githubiii) team is ahead of roadmapiv) constant stack increase among top holdersv) mvp coming in a few weeksvi) outside interest (confirmed by the team)vii) possible bigger exchange listings soonThis makes me optimistic both short and long term.
REQ have points LINK doesn't (i, ii for example).
Plus it hasn't mooned yet and people know this.
I mean I don't expect it to moon x5 EOY but I feel like we'll see nice upward movement pretty soon.
