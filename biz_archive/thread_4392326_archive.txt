If you want to turn 12k within 2 months into 500 Bucks you just have to buy high and sell low, trade with all your emotions and feelings like i did.Fuck guys, i was able to turn 5k into 35k, cashed out about 23k and lost the rest because i felt like a trading god.Please, make a checklist, and stick to the rules.
Buy low, sell high, get early enough out even if the profit is super small.
Still better than ending up liquidated.
Lil Peep died show some respect
You can do it in like 5 minutes.
