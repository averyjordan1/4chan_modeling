Congrats to those that sold high.
Seriously.
Bought at 880, sold at 1750.
I regret not having sold at a higher price but whatever.

lightening network for BTC core will be centralized, believe all the 'market manipulation conspiracies' all you want.
whales want decentralization- stop being a retard.
This shit started at 300 & corrected itself after going up 1000%
I was able to sell at 0.5 BTC each because some whale on poloniex had a 2800 BTC buy order in place.
Once that got eaten it dropped to 0.22ishI can't believe it, I finally sold the top for onceI am waiting to re-enter if it goes to ~$600-800.
I am currently sitting in ETH because it is the most stable with the 2nd largest cap
I lost 25% of my portfolio because of this shitcoin.
Bought around 700, sold at 1500.
Hate myself for not selling at +2000 but at least I'm not bagholding
Remember, the higher BTC goes now, the higher the next BCH pump will be.
Made 10k on this shitcoin, but alas cashed to usdt not btc
just be happy

still correcting :^)
