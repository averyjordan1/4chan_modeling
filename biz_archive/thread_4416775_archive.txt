December 2017>you wake up like always>check Blockfolio>LINK is at $18 and rising>you check /biz/ and it turns out that SWIFT adopted the Chainlink systemwhat would be your reaction?
then i actually wake up in a shitted bed and dog is barking around and mom screaming at me>that damage control
It's too early for this and realize I'm dreaming.
i have only 300 Link.I would still be happy but probably just hold 90% of it
A deluded LINKie can dream.
I would literally cry
Iâ€™m holding this to atleast 2020.
you wake up like always
>thinking swift will adopt link when the internal xrp ledger and the external one exist
>tfw nolinker
desu I'm gonna buy link at the end of november and then sell if nothing happens in december
he doesn't know what ChainLink even does
all that shit STILL has to connect to LINK if it wants to use outside data for a secure smart contract that is always up and tamperproof
Post more AJ
So, you saying SWIFT is buying out XRP?
Because they are competitors.
All those shill threads... Maybe I should get link after all.
$100 of link shouldn't hurt, right?
It's too early.
I'm betting 15th of March for a good start to the spring

I would drive to the local pub and order drinks for everyone
I would put March as the actual network release.
The announcement of it leading a few days before.
