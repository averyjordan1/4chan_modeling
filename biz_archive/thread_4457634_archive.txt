Some day they will!
I'll go all in when I feel something is about to happen.
"LINK will never be 40 cents again"I guess they were right
At this point I'm accumulating LINK as a side goal just to spite all the FUD here.
pic related (guy in the newspaper pic, not the newspaper headline)
and how are you spiting your bleeding portfolio?
lol I've made 6% off of LINK in this week alone.
And guess what?
I just bought more LINK.
I may be wrong and it'll be a humbling experience if I am, but thats nothing I can't handle.
As of now I'm staying on course.
Salivating at the idea of Link hitting a dime.
links at an all time low and keeps going lower how have you made profit?if its day trading then you could have literally done that with any other coin too
this
im buying a shit load of it.
i cant pssibly get burned worse than ive been burned by siacoin, reddcoin, xvg, dgb.
ive lost like 70% of my money because of those bad choices.
is this really any worse?
This.
It would be the cheapest lamboticket in human history.Biggest transference of wealth from nolinker to linker.
LINK is not those coins.
Buy up all the LINK you can while the team is still quiet and working on launching the main net.
There's a reason this project is shilled so fucking hard here.
unironically yes, link is even shittier than those other coins.
You could possibly get burned worse.
You very well could
bought right before the quick jump in early november, sold at the top and bought more at the bottom.
Can you imagine if a confido was pulled on chainlink.
That would be nuts
Despite this being the most promising coin I've ever seen, this is unfortunately true...
chainlink has 1 dev lmao cant even update their github or hire more devs with all the money they've gotten.
really makes u think
Ari Juels and his team from RSA Security are working on the coin FYI...

Link is a legitimate PnD though, there is no way this downtrend is that organic.
