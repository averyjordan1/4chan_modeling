From DYORing.
You never listen to advice, you evaluate arguments in favor and against things and try to think of your own.
You fact check to some degree.If someone says something is good and something else is bad, investigate on your own and seek out potential criticism against it from people who disagree and evaluate whether it makes sense and when you can't, you know you need to get more knowledge and you figure out what that knowledge is and you go and find that knowledge.
Basically, what he said.
You can learn alot from normal FOREX trading vids, keeping in mind that crypto is the same thing on crack, meth, speed, cocaine, and ketamine combined.
The best way to learn is to start small, and making mistakes.
Drop everything you can miss into BTC, and start daytrading with 5-10% of your total.

It taught me to FOMO less and observe the up and downswings more patiently.
