>The satoshi valueDo you quantify your net worth in bitcoins or USD /biz/?
3 months ago I had over 3 bitcoins worth of altcoins, that was roughly 13k or about 25k by now.fast forward 3 months and I'm still shitcoining, still 13k after many up and downs but 1.50 worth of bitcoins for fucks sake.
Should we really measure everything in bitcoin instead of USD??discuss...
Do you want short or long answer?
Just cached out every BTC in muh wallet
In sats obviously, why else do you think everybody are posting pink wojaks about their altcoins for the past months?
Most of them have been preserving their value in USD, if not gaining.
it has nothing to do with what's "right or wrong", when you measure your coins against BTC all you're doing is asking a simple question: am I outperforming BTC?That's why people measure against BTC, to see if they outperform BTC.
There's nothing inherently wrong with measuring against $USD though, or against ETH, or whatever else, it's just that BTC is considered the big dog with the greatest overall gains since its invention, so one is always having to ask themselves "should I have just held bitcoin instead?"
and in many cases the answer is yes.
I relate everything back to its buying power in link.Trust me.
Normally BTC but right now USD because I think BTC is going to be replaced
let me also add thisif BTC goes up and you make a bad trade, but you only look in USD value, you'll think you did good when in reality you only made money because the value of BTC rose faster than you lost
