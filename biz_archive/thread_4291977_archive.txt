Anyone else think this BCH pump is from the same whales who knew in advance 2x wasn't going to happen?
The BTC pump, 2x cancellation news, and then BTC dump was obviously massive planned manipulation.
Starting to seem the BCH pump is phase 2 of this scheme.
yup.im getting real sick of this manipulation shit, and ive been in crypto since 2012.for the first time since mtgox im legit thinking about full cashing out and sitting in fiat for a while

Miners are switching and then People understand Bitcoin is not usable and that bitcoin Cash is and are jumping on board
Of course.
This is exactly the reason why the stock market is heavily regulated and the crypto marked needs and will get the exact same regulations.
Its a fucking shit show right now.Lets be real: If you didnt buy bitcoins a couple of years ago and hodl them, its over and you will never make it.
crypto is very heavily manipulated, but that's just one of the risks of the game.
I don't know why biz cant understand this lol its funny ive been here since .067 its a no brainer
