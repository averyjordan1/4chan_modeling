Is 300$ enough to trade with?
I'm a poor college student, and am trying to hit four figures with small trades to compound it, so eventually maybe I can have enough to pay my debt off earlier.
Obviously I'd like to be a multimillionaire but thats not really easily possible unless I invest in LINK or POWR because then clearly I should just drop out and pick my first lambo's color, because it's good to have my depreciating assets color match my taste.
But seriously, can I make it anywhere with small trading 300$?
How much do I need before it actually because big boy money?And if you're rich and you'd like to make it easier for me, feel free to donate here: 0x2F460CA6d66268905b9aCca1A1bb129C756C0DC6

The first x10 you find will take you to 3000, the next one will take you to 30000, and the next one will take you to 300000.

% of traders lose.
What makes you think you can do it?
What specific knowledge or skills do you have that thousands of hopeful professionals fresh out of university do not?If you only have $300 you probably don't want to lose the $300.
Why don't you stick to something a little more safe?
But seriously, can I make it anywhere with small trading 300$?No.
Why are stupid people allowed into college?

4481194I think it's honestly mostly the size of my penis.
It's just so god damn large.
It gives me some sort of edge that the other 90% just fail to have.
I can show it to you if you'd like..1 btc though13ke9af4F41RuCfcpev3U6WJNwqy8irmuz
Can't argue with that.
You sound like you're gonna make it.
I, too, have a very large penis and I average 2% returns per day.

$300 is the perfect amount actually.
You need to invest enough to keep it interesting, but not enough where you want to kill yourself.
Get in there and do your best.
