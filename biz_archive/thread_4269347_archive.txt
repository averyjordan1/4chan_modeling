you all said buy from coin base, so i bought $25 aud to fool around with, then I tried to transfer it to binance, somehow my $24 aud has dropped down to $15.39, how the fuck do I get around this bullshit.
I was planning to invest $1000 aud in various alt coins, but if i'm going to lose 30% to transaction fee's I'd rather just not fucking bother.
>TL;DR $24 turned to $15 before I even got a chance to invest, How The fuck do I get my money to binance and maintain the largest portion?
Buy bulk ETH instead, cheaper fees.
btc is getting attacked by miners right now with fake tx to push their 2x narrative, you're going to have to use ltc until they stop
But BTC is the ultimate coin, r..right guys?
Wait wait.. tomorrow a guy will give me 1 eth from his wallet.
Do i take it to my wallet or strait to binance?
Using coinbase as wallet.
who told you to buy from coinbase?
you should of used gemini
this is not a game to play with 25bucksfees are flat, not a percent, sadly (to transfer, works _slightly_ different when trading)
Stupid auscuck.
Buy eth from independentreserve.com and transfer it.
>buying BTC
 Just read there is a way to avoid fees.
Make a gdax account and it has free transfer from coinbase and i guess free between exchanges.
Use indipendant exchange, .5% fee and based in Melbourne.
