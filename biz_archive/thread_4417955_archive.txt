ETH is way better for transactions which makes BCH coin used for nothing but ASIC miners and average 4chaner to hand them his money

Not this BCH drama again.
Alot of you fats will short BTC thinking muh flipenning is happening.
Just then, the Finex jew will pull the rug from right under your feet liquidating you and leaving a whole new bunch of bcash bagholders.
It will be so epic.
The Jews are true masters of their domain
