>think about investing in some no-name coin for cheep>B3 is cheapest coin out there>see it started at around 1-2 cents per coin>peaked at 2$ a coin on Sept 16th>has since fallen to the lowest low of about 5/100ths of a cent per coin>market cap keeps going J-curve>why isn't anyone buying this coin....>half the coins are owned by one wallet, who is getting non-stop stake coins, 20 TRILLION worth in the past two daysThis is a pretty good scam really.
Make coin, give yourself a ton, then make it public and wait for the price to go up and sell out.
