Its 4:30am and I'm still holding Bitcoin Cash.
I can't go to fucking bed.I feel like i should just sell, but i don't want to wake up to a crashed bitcoin.
WTF is going on.
redbull is your friend
Usdt.Feeling so comfy right now watching this.Alts are getting rekt so I'll just pick mine again at bottom.
its going to bounce around between 2300 and 1200 for a day then we're going to 7k
take your laptop to bed, i woke up when bch was over 2k USD and it was beautiful
% 50%
put in ETH because it's fundamentally better; bitcoin (either version) is pure speculation
dont listen to these fucking lies OP, sell BCH right now and invest in the BTC dip before it peaks again
same, i then sold and bought back in 5 mins later at 0.4, every fucking time.
yeah but I'm pretty sure btc will still reign king.
this is just a pump and dump for the ages.this is the biggest worry, but id stake my life it'll go back down.
this is professional market manipulation
forgot pic
Sell now you can anon
Why didn't you sell after 2k?you didn't know what was going on we were talking about this for the last 36 hours
sell bitcoin cash and sleep easy knowing that you wont be affected by the dump
I'd be extremely surprised if something called Bitcoin cash overtakes Bitcoin.
I mean it's name sounds exactly like what it is: cheap chink knock off shit.
Never, ever, ever, EVER hold a shitcoin.
Just take the loss
Can't decide if I should drop my 1 BCC coin.
