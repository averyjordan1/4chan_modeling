Why does anyone invest in anything that isn't BTC?
Why do you unironically waste your time and money on irrelevant shitcoins?
I bought $1 ETHSo it's gone pretty well for me so far
 be you> poor> buy $200 worth of bitcoins> HODL> sell for $400 in 365 daysWhy do you even bother?
another hidden thread :(
Bought bitcoin cash as a backup plan fully expecting to lose it incase bitcoin got btfo.Best decision I ever made, especially as all of biz was saying to dump immediately.5x return on it which was much better than bitcoin over the same period

hold for ten years>sell for $200kStill a good deal.
This attitude of "I need to be filthy rich TOMORROW" is why so many guys here will never make it and have lost all their money on link, lol
lmfao so 7,000,000 a coin?so BTC will have a 147,000,000,000 (147 trillion) market cap.Who knows I guess we will see kek.
Be you, buy $1000 worth of btc > Make 10% in a month > Be me buy $1000 worth of shit coin > Make 200% in a couple days > Repeat some people like the fast lane mate
Because it does not scale, thus has no future.
thus has no future.That's what people said 2 years ago
just gotta know when it is just not alt market.
usually 2/3 of the time it is not.
"2 years ago" a lot less people tried to actually use btc.Have you tried doing a tx lately?
It costs you $15 if you don't want to wait days.
