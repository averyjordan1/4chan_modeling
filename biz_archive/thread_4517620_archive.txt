95% of your time is spent jerking offyoure not wrong.
what else do i do to pass the time between waiting for buy ins and sells?
my problem is that the dips occur when my dick in my hand and i have several tabs open.
I just HODL.
On rare occasions I'll scalp highs and lows to try and get more, but I don't really trade.I just... exist.
you'll be here, with us.
and in our /biz/ discords we're here for you pham
