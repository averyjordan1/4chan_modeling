fees are haram.allahu akbar
I got my balance taken into custody by IOTA foundation and I haven't seen it in months.
Seriously.
They're not ready to execute their vision.
Garbage wallet
Yes I am serious.
I got my balance taken because of the 2.3.0 to 2.4.0 transition phase.
The truth is that I was there to do it on time, except the transaction never within a week, which by then was too late and the transaction was canceled.
Some shit is actually is pending for days while some finishes in a minute.
Never finished.
