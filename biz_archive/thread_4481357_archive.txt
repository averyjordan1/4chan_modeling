You are an insect to me
Im talking about the pajeets.
There were always a lot but how many more broken english shill threads must a man see before he snaps
Top kek, beautiful response.
Just barely not smart enough to be autist.
Stop holding alts and hold strong coins like BTC, ETH, LTC and XMR.
Alts are not the way to go with the current market situation.
Hold your money in strong coins which are fairly stable.
All four above have seen nice % increases all while other alts decrease.
2018 will be good for alts, the last bit of 2017 won't be.
VIRUS.
I pajeet post for fun.
When there's a new thread for a coin I go to the bitcointalk forums and copy-paste the most pajeety posts until I earn some precious (You)s
