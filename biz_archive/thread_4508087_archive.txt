Lol try harder to larp OP
Around $11K.
Started with crypto mid October.
Biggest regret so far is watching my BCH go to 2.8K and doing nothing.
Didn't understand PnD properly and thought it stays like that...
What would I be larping about?
I sold bch at 320
I was all in on POWR on Nov 15th then sold it all for ARK.
However, I didnt change my blockfolio to see what potential gains i would miss out on...i would have made +60% gains by today if I would have just held POWR... >mfw
