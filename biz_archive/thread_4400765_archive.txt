Get in , it's going up and fast.Don't tell me I didn't warn you.Last chance.
Huge news coming in a couple of hours.
It's not going up because the jews keep reinforcing the wall at 3120 sats.
It's not the Jews, it's bagholders trying to dump this shit token so they can at least sell it for the price they bought it at
What's the news?
Listing on Coinrail , which has big volume.
Then why does it come down every time the price has dropped enough to make another run?
