So I sent some eth to a presale pool contract a month ago and i havent seen the tokens nor my eth returned.
did I get fuckedhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x12365ffbaa6a4387ca536488a8cfbfbfb00b3919
Did you contact their support?
Perhaps you did receive the tokens but you have to manually add the tokens to your balance.
Should've shown up in my wallet on etherscan.
Cant read smartcontracts but the contract has several internal transactions to other adresses.
im clueless atm - wish I could read contracts
You wasnt whitelisted m8 u fucked up
Says everyone's whitelisted or else it shouldve been returned
