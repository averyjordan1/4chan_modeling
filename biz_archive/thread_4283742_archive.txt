Why did Eth dump so hard with bitcoin?
Why won't it recover?
I thought eth was BTCs rival.
Wtf is the corrolation - so btc will go up and eth will stagnate now.. fucking great.
1 step forward, 2 steps back.
I thought eth was BTCs rivalThat's BCH now
if the bitcoin/usd price goes up, the eth/btc price has to go down because of arbitrage
Then why doesn't it go up now that btc/usd is going down?
Crypto sentiment is still too tied to BTC/USD price.
Then should I sell now?
I'm like $10 down on 100 eth but if I'm gonna keep losing and could put that into btc when it's low
It is pretty retarded since ETH holds much more value as it has thousands of trading pairs.Bitcoin cash is just speculative value right now, you can't trade shit with it
Ohh dont worry man...ETH will go much much lower.
It is held up by all the ICOs and everything but soon people will realize its not all that good.. most of the ICOs are build on ERC token and ETH can do whatever you even see peoples funds frozen and bs like this.
Digibyte is the best coin just invest for long term...you will gain the most.
