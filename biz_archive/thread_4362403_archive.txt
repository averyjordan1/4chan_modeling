I went from $130 to $15 ...Is that lazer network shit worth it?
What high yield interest programs should I dump my last bit of money into?I can't even cash that $15 out.
My fees are $15.
i joined bitconect in October and got my original 5 thousand amount back and doubled down and almost got 10k back, in two more weeks i will stop working, is it a scam?
in two weeks i wont care.
so why go to the bitconect clones, when the original one is still going strong?
I only have $15 left.
Bitconnect requires $100
I put $45 into Bitpetite 3 days before theymade off with everyone's money.
It's nothing compared to the tens of thousands some people lost, but I'm fuckin mad.Only have $40 in BTC right now, can't get into Bitconnect if I wanted to.
I've been looking for a bitconnect cheat sheet.
what happens with $100 if I just keep reinvesting?
