I guess the 40% move from 7900- was the next part of the fractal, so now it should go straight to 12500.Since after 12500 the next dip is around 8000, you can place your sell orders around 10000-11000 without issue, even at 10000 if you think the psychological barrier will not be broken.
it has to keep pumping otherwise bcc will eat it alive.if you thought bitfinex tether pumps were bad you're gonna be in for a hell of a ride.
This.
Bitcoin is $12000.We should all transfer our BTC to that exchange, cash in, retransfer the money to our exchange and buy BTC, then repeat until richness.Refute my logic, /biz/.
meant to say that bitcoin is $12000 in the Zimbabwe exchange.
