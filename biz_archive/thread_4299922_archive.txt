The only basis for the argument that BCH will take over BTC is that the lighting network is never going to be implemented, which we all full-well know isn't true.
Just stop being a faggot and pretending that bcash is suddenly taking over bitcoin, because it's not.
BCH investors had a nice run, but don't get ahead of yourselves.
