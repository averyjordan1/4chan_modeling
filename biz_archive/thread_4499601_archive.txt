worst marketing of any coin Ive ever seen
I FINALLY DID IT!
SOLD ALL MY LINK at -%50 aaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaBUT I FEEL SOOOOO FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
There's no working product why exactly would they be marketing?
What did you expect with a logo like that?
I'm down 16 BTC in LINK.
Feels so fucking stupid to have gambled so much now that BTC is going to 10k
They have a working product.

There's no reason for them to market.0.The only legit reason to market ever for a company behind a token is to attract partners.
Chainlink has that.If Chainlink was marketing it would be a bad sign, not a good one.Anyone who wants a quick flip can choose from many other pump and dump hypecoins like power ledger.
>Sergey has already hooked the most beneficial partners possible for the project.>OP thinks it'd be good idea still go after small fry while reeling them in.
My portfolio has reached rhe beast's dip (started with $1200).We go only higher from now on *haha, now, im crying inside*
