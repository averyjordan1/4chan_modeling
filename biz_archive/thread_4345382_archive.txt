Let's think about shitcoin cash logically.Let's compare the odds.What's the chance of a "flippening" where bcash moons to 5k while btc dumps?
%And what's the chance that BTC stays king, because normies only know btc and everyone trusts it?
Are you really betting that normies are going to switch to bcash?
They don't even know what blocksize is and they don't even care.
All they know is "bitcoin will make me le money"%Just think logically retards

Who makes these evaluations, 3% vs 97%?The same that predicted a defeat for Donald Trump?
Your odds are off, but it's still low.
I'd call it a 15-25% chance that cash values higher than BTC in the next week.

Everybody knew trumpNobody knows bcash
a flippening has nothing to do with normie money, if it does flip then normies will just think bch is "bitcoin"
The odds are far bigger than you realize.
Miners are king in this market.
If there is nobody left to mine your transaction then you can't do anything.
BCH is better for miners.
It's simple.
