How's your weekend?
I hope you're happy with the Bitcoin dip.
Insider news, don't buy BTC rnWait for dip at 6k.
Not jokingWith all the BCH shenanigans going on, I suspect price will go down even further
just made 40% on EBET and likely to make 100% more if /biz/ keeps shilling it.so, pretty good weekend.
shitcoin gambling is always fun.
the upside is it's a legit coin too so if i get lucky 5x or more.
my weekend was much better before you started posting.
i remember you and your gay ass avatars.
kys
stop shilling your pathetic shitcoin,we don't want to hear about it
good thanks for asking
Trading with emotions won't get you anywhere, Carlos.
I expected the dip and traded accordingly, so I'm alright.
I did not expect the dip to be as fast as it has been though.
bitcoin have dipped every weekend past two years
I just made a bittrex account what should I get and how much percent of each.
Shut up
Uh, yeah, but this time, its REALLY happening
Ive lost 80% of my portfolio 2 times on 2 shitcoins and got it back and more.
This dip is nothing ill make 20% in a day trade
