I'm curious... how many of you with 6 digit blockfolios actively researched and/or traded your way to those gains, and how many of you just got damn fucking lucky (IE you took a gamble on ETH in Jan 16 and just sat on it)?Be honest.
The deadly part of crypto is that you attribute luck to skill, then the odds catch up and you lose everything.
