man.
what a ride last year was.The good times will be back right guys??
?btc will go down so alts can go up right guyss????
tfw there won't be another altcoin boom where they moon along with bitcoin any time soon
We need BTC to go sideways not down.
Good times are still rolling.
And you cant see the end yet.
I think btc will make another 10x next year.
Normies coming in herds + institutional shit.
