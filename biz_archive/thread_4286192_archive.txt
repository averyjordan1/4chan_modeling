Since this place has become a massive shilling board i was thinking how we could all /makeit/ together without having to trust each others and i came to a conlusion:would it be possible to create discord/slack/telegram group where you could define the rule that people can only post twitter links?
Everything else gets filtered by a bot.People here are constantly trying to sell you their bags and so i think the best way we can all help each other for our mutual benefit would be crating a group where people can only post twitter links, that way we would only get tweets from various cryptos/projects.
Also it would be good to put a rule (dont know if its enforcable through a bot, kinda doubt it) that you can only post links of tweets that are maximum like 1 or 2 hours old, that way we would further reduce the spam of people posting 2 days old tweets trying to sell you their bags.....No 'shopped screenshots, no text, nothing - just tweeter links.What do you say about the idea /biz/?
We can still help each other out without having to trust each other.Also if you see a tweet that will make prices go up, once you bought the bags you can post the link so that /bizbros/ can get in early (you are still getting in earlyer), and we know what FOMOers bizbros are, that way it would cause a eaven big fomo right after the tweet which would cause eaven greater fomo with normies....
jesus fucking christ fags, im trying to unite us so that we all make it
Until one twitter link steals all my link
care to explain how that can happen?
i dont mean bitly links but genuine twitter links
