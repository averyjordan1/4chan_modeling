>tfw you realize crypto volume will be so high in a few years that some people on /biz/ will be literal billionaires


Tfw you realize people are this retarded
if i have 80k now, how much will i have in 5 years?
Either zero or over a million
i'll take the ladder
ladderOur future crypto millionaires ladies and gentlemen
The world will be an extraordinary place

pepe shirt wearing neckbeards will replace da j00s as rulers of the world!!!
his joke went way over your head...by taking the ladder he means he will transcend above all poorfags.
y-yes it was t-totally intentional...
Lets say...BTC/ BTG 21 MBCH 21METH 100MProbably the wealthiest 50M motherfuckers, get ready to punch your ticket fags
Who do you think is the richest guy on /biz/?There has to be some legitimate decamillionaires on here
there was a 19 or 20 year old kid here a few weeks ago who had like 2,000 btc and proved it.
lucky motherfucker
There was a guy who use to post here that I'd estimate was worth 8 figures at the time.
His goal was to hit $100M and cash out completely.
Anyone remember him?
He told me to buy antshares/NEO at $6 because he had insider info that it would be big.
That was my first big crypto win.There's another whale that still posts here occasionally who bought BTC and XMR early.
Worth about $10MM now.
Kek
i see we are in the mania phase
Swerve nobleman!
How in the fuck would you even cash out $100 million?
$1 million I could see, and maybe even $10 million, but $100 mil would be really difficult.
Cash out slowly over time across multiple exchanges.
Or OTC deals with institutional buyers.
I think there are escrow services set up just for this purpose.
Theres an aussie guy who mined early and started cashing out last year.
He paid off all his parents stuff and his sisters education and now travels full time with 500 btc left.
Lucky fucker.
He'd already cashed out around 7-8 mil
k
Not me though, since I'm fucking retarded.
Like I bought $300 worth of btc a month and a half ago and managed to daytrade it down to $240 worth, when I could have made 40% just by holding.
I also cashed 0.8 btc out at 2100 because I thought it would dip to 1500, instead it went to the fucking moon.
Who among us will be the alt-right's George Soros?
He used his crypto for good.
That's what it's all about
You won't be cashing out at all, that's the point, what you are holding will become global one word currency.
Hey guys, I brought bitcoin in 2010 and now I am fucking loaded.Biz has been kind to me so it is time for me to be kind back, the first 10 people in this thread to get dubs will get 10 btc sent to their accounts!

Yeah that's me.
I've sold off about 70% of my BTC for Bitcoin Cash since the Segwit2x failure.BCH hits a little over $200k and I'm a billionaire.
Possible?
Yes.
Also possible BCH collapses and I sullenly ride out BTC's rise as dumb Wall Street money pours in.
Or everything collapses.

Either it's a global currency or it's accepted enough you'll find someone willing to take it for big transactions.
If you're buying a $10 MM yatch you're going to have a decent sway with the seller.

I mean, honestly, Peter Thiel might if he gets more involved.
I have a series of very important experiments I plan to conduct that could have enormous ramifications for money balling a campaign budget- could literally save hundreds of millions of dollars.

I ran a chemical company.
Accumulated BTC around $60 (mined 25 BTC, sold my miner for 45 BTC) continued acquiring around the Silkroad bust, before the Mt Gox run-up, and after the crash from 190-500.
Switched some for Monero at $6.50.
Recently dumped for BCH

Peter Thiel's spending is like a roll model for mine.
Spend money on life extension, cloning wooly mammoths, backing politcians that everyone's butthurt about, and absolutely destroying those who dare to insult you by backing lawsuits for hundred million dollar damages
That's awesome...what do you do for fun?
Do you bother with a job?
I had a wallet all set up in 2010 but got a little sketched about sending a check to some guy in NYC for my bitcoins.

If you spent less time sucking his dick through text you would have gotten trips
Lol
see
Climb mountains.
Do political stuff.
I don't bother with a formal job but am looking into angel opportunities
And then they'll get greedy, won't cash out and bubble will explode in their faces.Back to zero then.> But muh "I won't need to cash out because I'll buy lambos with BTC".Yes, but for that it needs to be stable and at a real market price.
That's where a crash comes in.
I'm not sucking his dick -- it's called being a regular well-adjusted and polite person.
Not all of us on here are sycophants like you...Thanks though ;)

Absolutely did know it could.
If you look back on the old Bitcoin Talk threads there's a lot examining potential market cap.
If Bitcoin becomes a well-traded currency or asset it's price will be in the many hundreds of thousands to millions a coin.Prior to the blocksize snafu, the FUD was just a load of horseshit "baaaw a drug market got busted!!"
"Baaaww some crooked exchange collapsed" "Bawww China did something" "Bawww the price dropped 20% for no reason".
That information doesn't undermine the underlying premise and promise of Bitcoin.Now I've grown very concerned over Blockstream's takeover of Bitcoin and the fact that not only are they going to censor discussion, they'll always act to maximize the profitability of their own bullshit system and dismiss upgrades or capacity increases that could intrerfere with that.
