Plenty.Maybe very little.
I'm thinking of going into GPU mining.
I like building shi.
And while trading certainly does engage my autism, large mining banks of processors with several dedicated to determining the highest profitability among bios/miner/algorithm/crypto configurations coupled with cutting edge power conservation technology like Novek - the idea makes me a little hard.Or maybe just more than plenty.
It's not hard to make profit if you stagger your market investments and wait for good buys.
I just don't want to be 45 and wish I'd created a business and stayed on the forefront of non-asic mining, learning and growing and building and employing, instead of spending my years doing a lot of the same with trading.
