Universa.
They are currently doing their ICO - they could not have picked a worse date for it, but I don't mind.Anyway, competitor to Tezos.
Promising tech and have already closed deals with major corporate entities.
Their CEO is also a major player in Russia - met up with Putin in September and has convinced Belarus to invest in crypto.
They wanted to raise 100m.
Which I did not like, but because everyone is slowly getting rekt they are still at 14m.
The tokens they don't sell will be burned.Anyway, this thing is barely getting any hype, and this is the perfect time to buy.
Had there been hype, I would have waited and probably bought below the ico price after the ICO.
FYI: I know most of you cucks are new in crypto but times like these are the perfect time to buy.
The next alt run will be atleast twice the size of the last one and you can make yourself a millionaire if you make the right choices.Anyways, check Universa's website.

I hate ICOs with a pre-sale bonus with a passion.
You just know you're going to get dumped on by whales when the ICO is over.
If you think a pre-sale equals dump you are a retard.
Every ICO has a pre-sale and if they have not I can guarantee you they have given private discounts.You really think whales will dump on you after the ICO.
Whales are in the game for at least 2 years, thats when they dump, when it hits ATH.
Muahahahah I'm bagholder now
Got like 150 free tokens so whatever.
Hopefully I'll cash out like $150 in 2022 and pay some hookers to lose my virginity.
ENJ>EVX>REQ>ASTJust to name a few recent ICOs with a pre-sale bonusWhen these tokens were tradable the pre-sale whales instantly dumped to sub ICO priceDon't buy during the ICO, buy when the ICO is over and the whales dumped their bags
