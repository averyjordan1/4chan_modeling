THE RETURN OF THE KING

All hail the king
ok boys pump it 100x longlet's see how high this dead kitten can go
It's not over yet faggots
fuck is bitcoin R
Sold my XMR for BTC at .022, lets go
Bitcoin red
% bull trap
This is because nobody knows, or cares about Bitcoin Cash.
Like BCC being over $20 makes any sense.
It doesn't.
painfully obvious bull trap.
This.
It has no brand.
Bitcoin is the one normies know about.
Yeah...they know how shit and unstable and laggy it is now more than ever before
You just beted against the one real bitcoin, are you crazy?
I will not even feel sorry about you little lamb being headed for a slaughter, as it will be bloody red chart on BCC tomorrow
No anon they don't.
Normies don't care about BCC.
They never will.
It's a fake.
Nobody is swiping cards with BCC on it.
We aren't there yet.
BCC serves no purpose but to FUD real Bitcoin.
they at best have heard somebody mention this, but they don't understand, things the normie doesn't understand are immediately dismissed and swept from the mind.
the only possible normie reactions are do nothing, or sell coinbase back their scam.
Can't barely break, let alone stay above 6000.
Going to go re-test 5500, which it will smash through and go and test 5000.
Normies that don't study will buy BTC and leave after shitty first impressionNormies that do study will buy ETH
Yeah, this is what I think too.
Next week will be bloody with a couple good swing opportunities.
Do you think it will break past the $4800 fib.
Next stop from there would be all the way down to $4100.
