So Bitcoin is dropping like mad at the moment.Should i wait until it reaches rock bottom, buy a coin at, lets say, 5k and resell it once it goes back to 10k+?
and resell it once it goes back to 10k+?
>back to 10k+?
>implying ?
It can go much lower.
In the 10s is my prediction.
Price is based purely on demand.
A small scare can mess it up real good, as there is nothing but trust to back it up.
A in the 10s drop will take years to never to recover.
But money or what it represents is never lost.
