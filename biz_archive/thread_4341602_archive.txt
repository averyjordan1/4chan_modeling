2 questions-any phone apps where you can trade crypto easy?
I want to play around with Some eth during the day when I'm not home-second question, is it possible to set a sell and then buy again at different prizes.
Like stop los but where you donnt have the money yet to buy, just that it goes automatic when it's sold at say 3 satoshi and buy back at 2,7
Binance has official app.
Possible but not with this app.
Is it possible on computer then?
And i got te official app, can't seem to make any trades on it
