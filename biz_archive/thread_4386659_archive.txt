I'm a guy looking to make some money on the side trading crypto.
Got about $500 in BTC on Bittrex right now.
But I'm getting into technical analysis and so now I want to get my money off Bittrex and into an exchange that lets me short-sell.
To what exchange should I move my money to/start trading on?
I can't do Poloniex since for whatever reason their verification system doesn't work for me, and their customer support is garbage.
And cex.io and Bitfinex are out of the question too, since they don't offer margin trading to Amerifats (which I am).
What do
sauce?
seconded.
also feet
binance/hitbtc work pretty good for me
Kraken has a garbage UI, but they do offer leverage.
Honestly I would only use their site as a last resort.
I've been glitched out of closing positions too many times to recommend using their site for anything unless you really cant trade anywhere else.I didnt have a problem with Poloniex, so I suggest trying to register for it again.
It took about 2 days max for me to get verified, but is a great platform that offers some good altcoin-BTC leverage trading.

This was just in my 4chan folder.
Someone probably posted this off some slag's fb desuThanks, that's what I've been looking into.
Been more partial towards HitBTCBelieve me, I tried.
I've been talking to support for weeks but it keeps telling me that my address couldn't be verified, my ID couldn't be verified, etc.
And now support just stopped responding to me and the automated system says I've tried to verify too many times unsuccessfully.
So there's nothing I can do about that.
Which sucks/is frustrating because I've been verified on literally every other major exchange without this kind of problem
