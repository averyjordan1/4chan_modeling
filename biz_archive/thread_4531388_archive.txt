>he actually thinks one day people will be paying with something called satoshi, ether, monero etc.
Been doing that for almost a decade now
well techinally well be paying with USD (assuming were in the US) but in the backround crpytos will be converting it for our transactions.
it will make it easier for normies to deal with if we let them keep their paper monies.
how is a "dollar" any more normal of a word?
Personally, I still form alliances by marrying off my daughters.
People are already paying for things with Monero.

 On 15 January 1520, the Czech Kingdom of Bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally in Joachimsthal (Czech Jáchymov) and marked on reverse with the Czech lion.
The coins were called joachimsthaler, which became shortened in common usage to thaler or taler.
The German name "Joachimsthal" literally means "Joachim's valley" or "Joachim's dale".
This name found its way into other languages: Czech tolar, Hungarian tallér, Danish and Norwegian (rigs) daler, Swedish (riks) daler, Icelandic dalur, Dutch (rijks) daalder or daler, Ethiopian ታላሪ ("talari"), Italian tallero, Greek τάλληρον, τάλιρο, tàlleron, tàliro, Polish talar, Persian dare, as well as – via Dutch – into English as dollar.
[1]Because it's not named after some Czech mining town, that's why.
In the future people will pay with fiat based cryptocurrency.
