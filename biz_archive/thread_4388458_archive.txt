Hey /biz/, I've got about $600 / month to play with, and I've been thinking about rolling the dice on these x100 leverages, twice a month.I figure if I do this for one year, that'd 24 shots at making it happen.
I don't really give a shit if I lose out on the dough, but I don't want to be an idiot about it.
If one of them hits, I'll just put the profit in BTC, and continue doing this like nothing happened.What are some of the best resources to learn about doing this, so I can minimize losing my ass?Cheers.
How much is your margin at 100x?
who is this semen demon and why do i keep seeing her
Her name is Chung Lee and she died in Fukashima.

you're going to kill yourself with that kind of leverage
I have no idea about any of this, but want to learn.
no he will just instantaneously liquidate 300 bucks every couple weeksmy advice is to average out how close you get to the tops and bottoms and reduce your leverage based on how accurate you are on average100x leverage if you wanna lose your money every time cause there is no way you will catch the absolute bottom every time.
do it the first few times with 30 bucks at 10x leverage and try and figure out if you would completely lose your money.
odds are you will for a while until you start to understand good entry points.eventually you will probably realize that you miss the bottom by 5-8% semi consistently or something, and you can reduce your leverage to give yourself more cushion on your buy ins.the problem with such high leverage is that it applies a digital system to analog charts.
an uptrend is a sequence of many ups and downs and the odds that a price will only be hit once are very low.
that means even if you buy just about the very bottom at 100x and it dips a few dollars more, your position is liquidated by your lender and better luck next time.
