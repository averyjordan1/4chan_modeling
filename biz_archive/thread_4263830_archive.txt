You saw me posting a lot tonight, I was the one fudding talking about the huge sell walls, 88 RSI, selling at 17k sats, etc.I was new once.
Blindly following /biz/'s shills and losing money.
You gotta learn how to separate the quality coins from the scamcoins (no team, no whitepaper, etc.
)If you really want a coin that has the potential to be the next NEO, look no further than Metaverse ETP.Rockstar CEO who travels the world, gets shit done, super transparent team, they literally have news out every single day.
Check their twitter for exchanges, business partnerships, etc.https://twitter.com/mvs_orgThey are backed by an original Bitcoin investor / monster bitcoin whale Chandler Guo (go to his twitter he will be wearing metaverse shirt in recent post)Partnership with DraperDragon, the list goes on and on.Here's all the information very well put together.https://www.reddit.com/r/Metaverse_Blockchain/comments/7brws7/metaverse_etp_professional_opinion/Metaverse ETP is currently at 50k sats, strictly because BTC is refusing to stop it's run.
Once it retraces (WHICH IT WILL, LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE BULL RUNS ON THE CHART), ETP is going to hit new ATH's and skyrocket.There's my kindness for the night.
Take it as you will.
It's really a no brainer.
