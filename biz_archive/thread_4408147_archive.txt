Bitcoin Segwit2x Fork Nov 17, 02:00-09:00 PSTOur team is preparing for the Bitcoin Segwit2x fork.
To ensure the safety of customer assets, we will progressively disable BTC services in advance of the fork.
Shortly after the fork has occurred, we will re-enable all functionalityShit people withdrawing funds have gotten REPLAYED into Segwit2x.SEGWIT2X IS HAPPENING
already resolved
DYOR faggot
REPLAY is a real concern right?
like one or the other not both can exist or you'll double spend your btc?
o protect customer funds, Coinbase will disable Bitcoin sends and receives at 2 am Pacific Time on November 17th, and disable buys and sells an hour before the fork, which is currently predicted to occur between 6am to 8am Pacific Time on November 17th.
All functionality will be re-enabled shortly afterwards.
So will have the equivalent amount in s2x if it gets adopted right?
SO long as I keep my btc til it gets tradeable?
Nice FUD cashie... go to sleep and dream that your bags aren't worth more than a dog turd.
