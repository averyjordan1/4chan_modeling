>alright alright we all bought this shit coin what are your price predictions /biz/??
?I think 15$ if we hit binance
price wont move because no one is selling
A big problem right now is how inconvenient it is to buy large amounts on ED, especially with low sellers.
If we hit Binance then $15 is nothing.
NEVER SELL

gonna be the story of this coin.
Thats why I'm waiting for 15-50 bucks to sell
