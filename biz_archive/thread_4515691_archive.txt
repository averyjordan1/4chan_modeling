>buy product on ebay>receive it in time in perfect condition>leave bad feedback anyway
It's only to your benefit.
It's for everyone's benefit to leave bad reviews to keep prices down.
I wish normies would stop giving good reviews.
enjoy your rung in hell

Its just so brilliant.
Lets say you want to buy a laptop from me right now using Bitcoin.
How would we do it?
Do you send me BTC first or do I send you the laptop first?
Neither one of us would want to be the "first mover" for fear of scamming.
This has a chilling effect on Bitcoin's potential with online commerce... until now.
Confido will be the key to unlocking P2P commerce using Crypto.Another analogy: Confido is the 0x of eBay.
0x is like a P2P decentralized Poloniex, taking out the middle man.
Confido is a P2P decentralized eBay, taking out the middle man.
All you need is a person you want to trade with and you can now exchange trustlessly.
And its something you can quite simply integrate into any online shop.
The potential is incredible!
