What’s your long term plan with your crypto loot?
I’m looking to pay for a house or apartment straight up and just live there trading, have no desire to start a family ; just get that money and go out in a blaze of glory
Just get a lot of money so people will stop thinking I'm a failure.And then I'll probably live the same way I do, but paying for my own stuff instead of scraping by every month.
>little bit of plastic surgery>get some juice and join a better gym than the one I go to now >go to some classes to improve myself such as self defense or cooking>new wardrobe>decent car>get the girlThat's my goal for, I wanna save up for an year of those things which isn't much I have others but I'm gonna focus on the small ones first
Buy a house to live inBuy a house to rent outKeep workingImpregnate partnerConsider actually starting one of the 5 or so businesses I keep thinking about doing one day.
>Buy house.>Build awesome mancave/shed that I can just chill in and build projects>Splash some on the wife and kids every now and then to keep them happy too.Could probably do that with 250k to be honest.
But I wouldn't pull out that much until I had 500k, so that I could continue trading with the rest.
