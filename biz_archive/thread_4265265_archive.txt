Which one to all in on?I always go big or go home, investing in both is out of the question.
Mid term reqmlong term link
what do you consider mid and long term?
going for req on the short term here, looking for it to at least do a x2 from its ico price then I'll sell some.
Link had its moon, cooled off for a while, REQ hasen't so there's that
So let's picture a time frame31st december 2017Which one of the two will have mooned harder percentage-wise?Request right?
Yes, unless Sergay takes a break from fast food and drops something on us.
In that case LINK goes SKRAAAAAA
REQ
Alright even though there are only 5 shitty replies, strap it in let's go boys 200 k req holder incoming
Good decision- REQ has a much higher potential upside IMO, and the token has a much better use case and model for appreciation (i.e.
tokens burnt on every transaction, as well as the possibility of staking to validate transactions and earn money in the future) compared to LINK.
Ironically, they will need the ChainLink network to operate.
Same as Confido.REQ might be good for short-mid term, but make no mistakes, if LINK does what it has to do, it will blow everything else out of the water.
It's literally the link between crypto and real world operations.
I truly believe in LINKJust hoping that through request I will eventually be able to buy more LINK than right now.
req all in take half out eoy or q1 2018 for link
Yeah wouldn't be a bad move at all
REQ is now over ICO price.
I'm sure it will pump now.
