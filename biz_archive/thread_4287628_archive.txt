So let me get this straight, the reason why BTC is taking such a huge dump and its retarded cousin is going apeshit with ATH's was because a literally who dev team claimed BCH will replace BTC in 6 months?I hope you know that when the market realizes the opinionated crap behind that claim BCH will tank very similar to Ethereum's bull run after $420 you can expect the money moving back to BTC and the FOMO will be glorious possibly pushing it further past 7k.>muh flippening!>FUD!>Salty no-coiner!The bigger BCH gets the harder it will fall, pepper your angus.
