Since tether always tries to stay at 1$ could you profit from it by buying low selling high repeatedly on those tiny price changes?
Can I make money by buying low and selling high?
Sure, if you're ok with just the numbers rising up and not being able to cash out with it.
Sure, if you want to make .0002 cents for every USDT you trade.
yes, but it takes obscene amounts of money to do it.
that's what long term capital management did.
