For a little bit now, I've been thinking and looking to add another income to add to my total salary.
Currently both of my salaries come from policing and being the military.
I work overtime when I can for both jobs.
I've considered getting into the fitness industry but it's too hard to make decent extra cash.
So I've also have thought of either off-duty high class private security or investments into BTC.
Any reasonable suggestions would be appreciated.
