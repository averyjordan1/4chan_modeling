Sup lads.
Most of this board is shit but you guys are funny so here is a scoop --ARK is going to announce in a press release tomorrow that they have doubled the size of their dev team (6 to 12).
I'd expect a bit of a surge following that announcement (with maybe a minor dip after).Remember lads -- get in on the /ARK/, or you'll drown and die.
If you're really an insider whens the mobile wallet release?
Been at 98% for ages that's what i'm really excited for
LOL that's been done for a couple months.
But Mike (top brass) wants to hold off on releasing it for some reason.
A little sketchy if you ask me.
TA looks good, thanks for the heads up OP
I'm assuming its due to the business entity not being completed yet?
(Currently at 98% too)Lots of coins having trouble getting listed on the apple appstore without the proper legal work (see the recent neo wallet take down on iOS)That's most likely the case doubt they would purposely delay it for any reason
Good...
If true.
Don't care so much about price.
But was losing hope they could deliver without expanding development team.
Ya I guess man.
It would be a little discomforting if the price was moving but they weren't working on the product very well.
I suppose I'm more comforted if the price is standing still but they are actually advancing.
