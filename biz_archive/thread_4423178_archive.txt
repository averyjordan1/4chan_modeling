SO MANY DELICIOUS DIPS WHAT COIN IS BEST ROI POWR, WTC, OR LINK
how much bcash to sniff her braphole?
Ambrosus or BlockMasonLink and walton are already months in with no progress
Has to be on binance...just skimmed through the boxmining wtc visit their product looks cliche but a product nonetheless and under $5 seems like a good buy
LINK and WTC are good bets.
WTC if you want you want to make money soon.
POWR is gonna lose you money, better energy coins in the pipeline, and fake pbc leak fomoers are nust waiting to sell you their bags.
Powr is a long term hodl.
Its only been out a little bit we need to give it time
BlockMason just started trading on binance a few days ago, already has a working platform and product just waiting for the announcements next week to decide if im going to jump all in
FCT, in 2-3 weeks.
Screencap this
go all in on POWR you pussy
