where are my rialtomarines at?
I forgot this coin existed, weren't they supposed to get listed on a major exchange?
It's literally dead right now
well they're putting out some news, they've started trading, dividends will be distributed some time in 2018, what else... not the bags I'm the most proud of but let's see what happens I guess - taas went 4x i hope something like that will happen with rialto.
they seem pretty professional and are hitting their deadlines, but I think some peeps sold to participate in other moon missions - ironically not really a trader sort of coin

I'm not shilling I swear, just curious to see if there are still some other holders around
It's a security without a doubt, so it'll never get listed on real exchanges.
