i know about the usdt hack.
but wouldn't it just make sense to sit on btc if both usd and usdt are fraudulent?
i don't understand this fud lol
Crypto is built on emotional morons.
Just embrace it and use it to make you more money
...I know we joke about fiat (usd) being a shitcoin but the government monopoly we're all trying to accumulate is not the issue here.
How do you know BTC is not fraudulent?
um btc is only gonna have 21m so that isnt fraudulent.. im not smart enough to get into detail i just watched hours of videos a day.
so what isn't fraudulent is your reasoning apparently lmao
some big exchanges have fiat pairs instead of USDT, kraken, and gdax trade straight from fiat to crypto, bitfinex and binance and other shitcoin exchanges are the ones that use USDT, hence the dip from people cashing straight into fiat.other people will have to either pick coins that they think will wether the dip or try to get from crypto to USDT to fiat as fast as possible, potentially clogging the network and putting significant stress on tether by effectively creating a run on the bank/reserve that tether has.
If they don't have enough fiat to satisfy everyone, there could be problems.
I'm hoping we see the 30% bear market over the next week or so, but this might also just blow over and we'll head up to 10k.
