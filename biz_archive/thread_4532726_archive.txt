I am getting ass fucked by TRIG.
I went all in balls deep and now I can't get out.
Trig is a fucking retarded concept anyway.
Literally zero gun owners want anything to do with (((smart guns))).
HAHAHAHA who the fuck would buy something like that
What price did you buy in at?
Blockchain for government(guns) summit in 6 days.
Seriously.
This is like BAT as far as shit concepts go
Buying guns to track and cuck you out of using themI sure love the idea of my goddamned gun needing internet access so it can cuck me out of using it and tell the government when and where I fired it.
The idea is,>the government will make all guns “smart guns” in the future anyway.>they’re planning some central server to track all gun owners>blocksafe is the alternative>instead of centralising all fun info it is distributed on the blockchain>everyone is on an even footing>government gets “smart guns”>/k/ keeps their freedom to bear arms
