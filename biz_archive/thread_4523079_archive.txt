So anon, why won't ETH tank after hitting ATH like the last two times?
Just wait for BTC to dip below 4000 and I guarantee that you will see a 50-70% tank on all Alt-Coins
Because there are no triple tops you faggot
You wish bitcoin maximalist hoarder.Bitcoin is dying never to return
As somebody who is 70% in ether, I don't think it'll stay at this price.
I think it'll go and hover around 390 and then go back up.
There are a lot of sell walls.
https://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:chart_patterns:triple_top_reversalLike I said, I hold 70% of my portfolio in this coin.
But triple top does happen.
i would argue it will not , because you can see the empty spikes of the other two peaks but this one has groundswell supportit will correct some but not as crazy down
Not really tanking if BTC drops in value because of ETH/USDT pairs
just because its not common doesnt mean it doesnt happen.
just because there isnt a standardized term for a triple top doesnt mean it doesnt happen.
its literally the same as a double top.
it might shoot a bit above ath but i just sold and will buy back in when it dips 20%
