Can we talk about this coin?
Can we talk about how fucking nobody ever talks about it despite being #10 market cap?
I don't think I've ever seen a single thread on it.
I'm not shilling, I just literally know nothing about it and would like to know why it's valued at $1.8B.
What does it do?
Is it a currency?
Do I use it to stake or run a node?
Why does the logo look like a celtic sports team insignia?
all we know is that it's japanese.
they refuse to give us any more information.
they have arguably the best blockchainchinks and shitdesu i have no idea but people dont care because its a coin with 8 billion supply thats already .20 so theres fuck all mega gains left in it
it's too complex, I just stick with my xmr & Ark
NEM has a great blockchain but it suffers horribly from lack of PR.
I believe the coin is more popular in Asia than anywhere else, however the lack of trading volume bothers me considering it's a top 10 coin
people who got airdropped this for free on bitcointalk became millionairesit's too painful to talk about when you realize you're just buying their leftovers
It's a smart contract platform, like ETH.
It does a lot of things better than ETH, but was late to the party.
It was also made by neckbeards and is called NewEconomyMoney.
It's safe to say it's not going to have any good partnerships and no one of substance is going to build on it.

Too many tokens for me to give a shit.
No idea what it does but it's always top 10.

Bitcoin was made by one japanese dude, this is made by a whole team of them.
Come on now son.
Its some Japanese thing that most know nothing about.
Best to just ignore it and let the nips do their thing, they don't incessantly shill to westerners like the chinks do.
cool logo and name,just bought 100k
