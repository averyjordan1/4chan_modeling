SUP BROs, I’m feeling generous today and I’m gonna let you in a hidden gem because karma and shit… plus I owe you big for Confido.
Centra Tech (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmpBpCJSXCc - new Website soon) is seriously undervalued atm.
They have developed platforms that connect world commerce and cryptocurrencies.
The Centra Card will make it convenient for card holders to spend their crypto in all fiat currency transactions creating a true bridge to the world and cryptocurrencies.

They plan to keep on adding more Cryptos every now and then, including NEO, EOS, NEM& IOTA.They also insure your funds, if Centra gets hacked or you lose your crypto due to a centra mistake, your funds are insured.
Their app is already downloadable & usable in both the appstore and the google playstore.
Regarding FUD about Centra not having the ability to issue Cards connected to the CCE: “Centra Tech has a relationship with a domestic and international issuing bank through our program managers.
This allows us to issue these cards worldwide without any hiccup as the cards are being provided by the banking institutions whom have a relationship with the card carrier network.
Centra Tech is not required to have a direct relationship with the card carrier network as it is not the issuing bank.” (NDA still up about the bank atm., to be released when all the cards are shipped).Centra is gonna have a MASTERCARD LOGO worldwide, 100% confirmed.
They have already sent a few cards with the app activated.
