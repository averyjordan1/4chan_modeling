Sleeping giant but not for long!
New exchange announcement in 1-2 days.
Team has locked 4.5m coins and will not release them.
Super low marketcap at 8m, so much room to grow.
Team is very responsive on telegram/twitter/reddit.
Why are you poor faggots not on this?
You must really be hating money if you dont want to 5x your money by december.
Binance exchange is in the works.... expect it to be listed on binance in a few weeks!!
If they can get it on binance im in.
Everybody in /biz/ is already in this, tell me something new
Sleeping giant?The fucking stupid shitcoin pumped 12x its value minutes after ICO.
I ain't going near this coin for a while till it stabilizes with a proven floor it has way too much room to drop and too many holders that could dump on me and still be in profit
You need to stop posting this.
There have been multiple outbreaks that we struggled to keep back.
Before long even we cant stop this.
I assume you are done accumulating which is why you are posting but some of us havent.
Delete this.
