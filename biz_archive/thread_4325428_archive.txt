How likely is it that SALT will moon before LINK?
I currently hold both and my game plan is to sell SALT once it moons this december to buy more LINK?
Whats your price prediction for LINK and SALT by EOY 2017?
I think they're both mediocre to bad coins that will probably stay the same or drop in value.
both SALT and LINK are shitcoinsBeing this much of a brainlet.
Tell me, which alts do you hold aside from Ethereum?
I'll buy a 100K of whatever she's selling.
let me guess: omg
SALT is going to fucking explode in value in just a matter of weeks.
I plan on selling about 1/2 my stack when it hits $10 and holding the rest for long term gains.
