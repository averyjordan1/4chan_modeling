ahahahahaha, shame really on the people who sold all their NEO because some dumb fuckers on 4chan told them too.
Guess they're too dumb to make their own decision and instead follow what biz does.

Most people who are in losses just don't seem to know how to trade, they listen to shitty advice on this board and have been in this game for months yet they don't understand how to trade correctly.
This is the sole reason why I am making money off them, I feel pretty patethic for taking money off them but thats just life.
nice example in my thread, enough said
