Do we ever get to sleep in peace?
This BTC/BCH "war" is tiring me out and I'm hodling 50/50.
We need one alt to overtake both.
I'm sick of this shit.
Yes, buy Vertcoin and be forever /comfy/
PoW crypto can never be the 'currency of the future'

I was so glad I could timely and cheaply send LTC and ARK around this week.
4347998These guys got it.
Fuck it this shit better open people's eyes to there people more potential things to put their money into

Money skeleton is your key to comfy sleep
I'm wondering the same thing
