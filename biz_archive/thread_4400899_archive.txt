I just submitted a selfie and ID card for the Bittrex enhanced verification.Am I cucked for life now?
Will big brother come knocking my door any day now?
No, but some guy will definitely make fun of your fucked up face while approving the selfie.
no but theres a chance youll be a victim of identity fraud in the future.
Can BTC addresses other than the ones I have withdrawn from bittrex be linked to my real identity?
You just gave Pajeet your identity
All transactions on the blockchain are public.
So I guess whenever you move funds they can be traced back to the origin (bittrex).
A way around this would be to transfer them into something private (XMR) and then back into a fresh bitcoin address with no prior history.All this is irrelevant though, unless you're planning on doing some dodgy shit, or really value privacy.
If for example I use several of my BTC addresses in a single transaction.
