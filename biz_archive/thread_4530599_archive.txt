Okay so I think in virtually all cases you only need two 1000x coins to /makeit/.
Are those coins rare or just hard to guess which it'll be?
+1000%**
bothplus, sitting on the wrong coin doesn' just stall you, it kills you
if you want to make it: look into ITNStell nobody though, you can start shilling it in 3-4 months.
tell nobody thoughyou just did
Some of you guys are alright.
Buy xem.
that chart doe.
perfect entry
4530650please don't be lyin' brahs.
yeah because i like other people to make it but makes the chances of me brutally making it smaller now because i havent accumulated my full position yet.read whitepaper and ull see.
I'll be seein you on the moon.
I'll be in the red lambo.
1000xYou mean 100x?
100 x 100 = 10000.
10000 x 100 = 1000000, but that implies you can find two coins with enough volume to cash out that kind of money AND can even get 100x and that you don't lose money on any other coin in between.
It's more reasonable to get:1000 x 2 = 20002000 x 2 = 40004000 x 2 = 80008000 x 2 = 16000That's just 4 coins before they drop on ED and selling 2x ico for a quick flipThen you split the 16000 into 3:5000 x 5 = 25000That's easy 3 coins buying in ICO for 81KSo now you have nearly 100K, you split that up into 20K chunks:20000 x 2 = 40000Ending up with nearly half a million.That means finding 5 ICOs that you can invest in and flip when they drop for 2x ICO price.
That's very easy and keep in mind $40000 is only 97 ETH, very easy to dump that for a coin with good volume if you don't make it too obvious and throw up huge walls.
From there you just need to find two good projects that have a low mkt cap and that you can hold long enough to reach 1 mil and cash out with good volume on the market.In total we're talking around 12 ICOs to really make it in a reasonable manner
but crypto is a hype based market.
a solid coin doesn't mean shit, does it?hey red's my favorite color!
fine, I'll have the blue lambo.
not when it is just 620k market cap, VPN is a 3 billion market, i see this 300-400m by end of 2018 (just my opinion)this is monero but for VPN, get in now and dont tell everyone, start shilling in a few months when tech is ready and usable
You're right and that still isn't even that bad honestly.
