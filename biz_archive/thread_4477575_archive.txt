>be me>graduation time from meme university>school gives out 4 tickets each for family members>be a dumb robot that nobody loves and legit have 0 people to invite>decide to sell tickets for some money>suddenly get godlike idea>started buying up every ticket I could find and flip them for exorbitant amounts>avg purchase price: $50>avg selling price: $300>spend all of my life savings and gains from meme coins (~20k)>all I can do now is wait....>either walk away with 120k or... pic related>wish me luck you degenerates
good job dude!
nobody gives a fuck about going to graduation!
no loss!
make that money playa$$$
Make us proud anon
even if you kys
why not do this with concert tickets or something people actually go to
School is crazy rich.
20% Chinese millionaires 5% oil money and the rest are upper middle-class Americanos.
Simply put.
Big families -> Rich -> bigger profit.
Also you are right.
I just didn't want to admit it desu
if you cant sell them give them away to /biz/ so we can come and clap only for you while being silent for everyone else
I like this idea
is it in Massachusetts?
sounds like my college
This is fucking retarded and won't work.
Lul thx.
I teared up a bit.
And yes its in Mass.
school hears increasing reports of some freak selling all the tix at inflated prices>figure out its anon>anon gets expelled>has to pay everyone back their money and also loses the 50 cost of goods sold
school sees shortage of tickets for some reason>eh lets just print more>OPs tickets are now worthlessand then op learnt the horrors of centralization
It's not like I'll get a job or have a future anyway.
At least if it works I can be a NEET for a few years.
