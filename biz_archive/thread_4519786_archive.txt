Fuck off and leave my coin alone.

Not FoundThe requested URL /resources/csv/BTG_xcoinTradeAltcoin_minute.json was not found on this server.faggot
because every link on the internet is live forever?
Genius
Correct.
I am planning to move a coin with a market cap of close to $5 billion with a single /biz post
Kek something like this doesn't dissappear after a cuople of seconds how retarded are you?
Lol.
Screenshot is hours old.
What is actually the deal with this coin.
Why can CMC not display stuff like the circulating supply/market cap.
I've rolled the dice on this anon.
In for 0.3btc, sell order in at 2x.
The Korean's aren't trading this so how do you expect it to pump?
yetThe link in the screenshot suggests it's going to start trading on bitthumb soon, judging by the fact they've since taken down the JSON.
Can be cross-referenced with this reddit post:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eyahu/btg_listing_on_bitthumb_get_in_early/?st=jacegok0&sh=8a11debdFrom what I can tell is a real account, although fairly dead.I'm banking on the screenshot being real so I'm getting in on BTG now, praying it is real and then converting back to BCH before Jihan and co start pushing up the mempool.
Meh well I've still got my free BTG that I haven't bothered to access yet, so if it ends up pumping I'll just sell my free coins.
