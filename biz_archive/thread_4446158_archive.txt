What happened to this?
I made a couple ether selling it on ED and was able to recover most of my initial position for a fraction of an ether.
Great coin so far!!!
Would you recommend me to do the same?
I received like a million during that guys visit here and have completely forgotten about it.
Any chance of mooning?
developers literally froze people's wallets.
dump if you get the chance and stay the fuck away.
It's a pretty weird token.
Selling stupid cheap on ED.
This coin doesn't do anything.
Literally nothing.
