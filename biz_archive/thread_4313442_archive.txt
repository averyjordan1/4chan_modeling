I'm fucking out of this shit.
I rode the surprise BCH spike to $2k and cashed out microseconds before Trex crashed.
I watched those $30 million whale walls rise and fall like tsunami in a piss ocean.
I made 3 grand for literally no reason but luck.
I can't fucking deal with this level of hysteria and bald-faced manipulation.
ETH is the new "sane" long-term store of value, I'm dumping it all there and going to sleep.
Honestly I feel dirty all over having watching this shit go down over the past couple days, I need a long cold shower with extra chlorine to feel clean again.
Good night and good luck, you crazy fuckers.Just remember, whoever wins at this point, faith and confidence in all forks of bitcoin (and maybe crypto in total) has probably been damaged beyond repair now.
What a disgusting shitshow.
