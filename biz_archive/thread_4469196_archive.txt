It's the only coin on my portfolio not rising right now.
Why is that ?
Weren't they supposed to have tons of shit going for them (masternodes , partnership with microsoft, active dev team, etc ).They used to be in the top 10 of coinmarketcap for months, now they're struggling to stay in the top 25.Should I dump my bags or hodl ?
Dude , all the moonboys dumped tgis coin in order to loose money in another false moon trip.
