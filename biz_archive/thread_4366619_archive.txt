When is it acceptable to ask your boss for a raise?
When u lost all ur money because u invested in magic internet money and cant buy food anymore
you get 5% raise on your wage annually you ungrateful goyim
When the company is dependent on you to such an extent that you have leverage to ask for a raise.
Just ask.
It's not gonna kill you.
What if it makes everything awkward
