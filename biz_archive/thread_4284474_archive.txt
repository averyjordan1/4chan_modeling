So as I was saying the NULS tards that said they didn't want to sell until $5, I said sell at $1 since thats the resistance mentally also 40million marketcap is usually where ICOs hit the wall at.
Some didn't sell, also said it'll pull back to around $0.70 so you can think of buying NULS again since its at that range.
