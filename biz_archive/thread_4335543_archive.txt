People bought this at 150 sat and held>People in the slack were crazy thinking RDD would go to $1 even after the first redd-id delay
I've made over 100% return over the last 3 days flipping a shit coin like this.This shit is too good to be true, I'm getting nervous
Is this actually doable?
it sounds immensely stupid.
Doing it with doge 18 and 19
If its going between 18 and 19 who the fuck is buying at 19 when they can buy it at 18. stupid af senpai
Whales use doge to move around crypto since the transfer fee is 1 dogeAll I know is Iâ€™ve done it 4 times in 3 days
How much did you even put into doge.
