I was trading shitcoins on Bittrex when I was high.It was before the Aug 1 fork when the whole market was going down because people didn't understand a fork was free money.I legit don't even understand how I lost 95%, but lmao I did.
Marijuana really numbs your emotions (indica), which is why I quit.
5000 >> 70007000 >> 4000Cash 20002000 >> 3000
Cash 3000 and stop
Why don't you quit drugs instead and stop being a degenerate
My journey $700-120k starting February without any real major losesNow past month and a half: 120k-55k Literally all from LINK and bleeding alt coins and i don't even want to think about what the actual btc value would be now (definitely a lot more than 120k)
cfd 1k -> 1.3k1.3k move on to actual coins2200 -> 1500quit for a month then put it another 26004100 -> 30003000 -> 54005400 -> 40004000 -> 5800 (now)
DELET THIS
I don't smoke anymore, and I'm sure your vices/shortcomings are worse than mine.
my crypto journey>$0.00 --> $2.50>$2.50 -->$2.44Only using faucets, coinomi, and shapeshift.
after a whole month, I've learned that shapeshift is probably crippling my gains, but the anonmity offered is pretty fair, and that doge is a good store of value.
>something like $13k in BTC>think its gonna crash due to flippening>sell, get $200I invested my entire $13k savings just to earn a measly $200.
This shit is nuts.
I'm not doing it without stop loss orders next time.
$800 -> $1400> $1400 -> $600> $600 -> $900Feels bad to be poor and stupid
4600-I give up and stopped doing anything.
The end.
