What are your thoughts on Lisk anon?
holding bagsas usual
their logo reminds me of a magic item from an rpg
I first considered buying this when it was $3.87, now I wish I bought.
Think this will go up anymore?
seems like it should
I've been enjoying daytrading it for the last 2 days while the whale bot faggot pump and dumps it from 120 to 140 over and over again.
Is that a wallet address?
is it gonna keep going up?
or is this the crash?, the halving is happenign in like 20 hours
what halving dude?
nvm just read about it.
Does anyone even know what the Lisk foundation does?
I looked at their website again just now, and I can't figure out what the actual service/product is.
These iron hands won't sell.
here we come NOV 22
