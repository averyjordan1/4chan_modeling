I can never find any good ICOs anymore... fucking LINK fucked half my money away already, accidentally sent money to WAX scam sale at 2x the presale price and there are never any good coins posted on this board anymore :'( please tell me what to invest in again and make me rich I can't go on living as a poor peasant

I made a list of 14 promising coins that are yet to ICO, are in ICO or are inbetween ICO and being listed on any exchange (including etherdelta).Don't rely on biz.
Once someone says something on biz, most of the time it's already been pumped.Go to ico ratings sites and sift through for promising stuff.
Kneepads.
Duck Sicks for 10 bucks a pop.
good icos coming soon are IMOMetronome !Mcafee coin!also Dmarket, bloom, bitclave, ARtoken.Try small money with Ethlend or Ethlending ICO, can be second bitconnect.
Same OP...really need to look to see if they lok reputable IMO.
I only put 10% of my capital in ICO's cause of the risk.
Right now I'm in Omanilla.
Accumulate bitcoin you dumb nigger.
We have told you this for YEARS.
Do some research on DNA, Encrypgen's token, in the next few weeks that's going to turn around some serious returns.
