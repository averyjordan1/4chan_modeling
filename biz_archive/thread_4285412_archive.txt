Has money<Spends it right away
 money is just something to look at
eth roll, 69
I'd do the same thing in both situations.
Mostly because I'm in the former situation now.1) Put 50% in DOGE and 50% in COSS2) Roll out of DOGE from 100 to 140 sat.
Put into COSS after sale3) All dividends from COSS get converted to 50% BTC, 25% ETH, 25% BCH
All in LINKNothing.
Nothing?
Shit man, you don’t need $10,000 to do nothing, just ask my cousin.
unironically making 1 satoshi
Unironically buy BTC.
Whoever sells and believes that some failed project will take BTC's place is deluding himself.It's going up, much more people are buying lower quantities than selling huge quantities, seems like price is manipulated to be low to give whales a better entry point.
$10000I would buy 10 iphone x>$100000I would buy 100 iphone x
I would buy a cheap used car (~$3k) because driving my scooter to work in 33F weather is getting unbearable.Rest would be invested into stocks and BTC
$10kAdd to the down payment for the house I am planning to buy next year>$100kAdd most to down payment, rest in S&P 500I know it's not very exciting, but there'll always be time to be an edgelord later with the money I earn myself.
keeping your cash in handYou are one stupid nigger.
I'd buy 10k worth of NULS at $0.70.
Then in a few weeks I'd be getting my dick sucked by some hot strippers while I snort coke out of there arse.
I dont need your fucking money
10k would mean i'd bother to plan for how to manage through the 2-3 month recovery period (can't work etc) when i'm donating a kidney soon rather than just going fuckit because everything will go to shit.
100k means it would be easily doable and have enough left to have some income/investment stream throughout a protracted recovery.
sigh /bizCompedy option is repaint the lambo with a street fighter theme obviously
all in on low volume shitcoin on coinexchange
Deeponion dev basically did this to me, I sold at $4.25 for $9,100
Lmao.
You live in IN don’t you.
Buy a 4.5k computer, desk and chair.
Then invest the rest into a shitcoin that goes on a +10000% moon mission.
Put it into a volatile penny stock at it's low point.
$10,000> $2,000 emergency fund> $4,000 to poker bankroll> $1,000 to engagement/wedding ring (I guess that's how much those cost, fuck if I know though)> remainder to LTC, silver, Mossberg 590A1 (dat home defense, Texas style), new mattress, upgrading to washer/dryer that actually works and isn't a fire hazard lol$100,000> $5,000 emergency fund> $10,000 poker bankroll> engagement ring, I abhor marriage as a concept but GF is a rare find> same other expenses, but more invested into LTC.
I'd be able to pay off my car (and keep using that motherfucker for the next decade).
Buy a computer (srs, posting from work computer atm), and be able to help support my niece> I'd be able to help my parents pay off their house or at least give my old man at least some chance of retiring at some point> $1,000+ donations to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, ASPCA, and perhaps a couple of other charities that actually put the money toward helping people and not their own executive pay and marketing themselves.
Something for Veterans, I think.Not really sure what else.
That sense of not being perpetually stressed about the month's bills would be nice.
I'd like to use some of it to put some good into the world.
And as far as the poker goes, bankroll requirements are steep to be able to survive playing, but I have the ability to do that for a living instead of being a wageslave - my firm doesn't exactly shy away from reminding its people that we are expendable.
At any rate, I appreciate OP for positing the question.
Been struggling and thinking about finances a lot lately and this exercise definitely help put things in perspective.
And I suppose obligatory /begpost: 15r2fpUqWe1cSc8yrMARqwYSdwzyy498kP
Invest some in crypto.

Buy my parents a vacation.
throw money in the ocean
That’s what you think, dumdum.
That’s why you’ll never be rich.
Buy my parents a vacation.This is why you can't afford to.
But anon, I can already afford it.
It would just be nice to buy it with someone else's money.Do you disapprove of my decisions because you think it would be wise to invest it all instead of spending it on something nice that will not yield a profit?
/biz made me hate link.
Fuck this shitcoin.
hope it burn with all who owns it
y-yes I live in IN
10k or 100k unironically into prefork btc then forget for 2yrs more.I think we'll need 1.6m altogther for THE change: stop working, start living, use the capital to generate an income stream to live off.
And if that fucks up then cannibalise the capital at 40k a year So thanks for the 10k or 100k but theyre not enough to change what imma doing
I just remembered you from an old thread.
With 10k I'd probably spend 3k, invest 7k in cryptowith 100k I would probably spend 10k and invest 90k in crypto/restaurant
If 10k$ i would invest 50% in crypto (well tether for right now)and the rest would go to funding a game development project i'm working on, if 100k$ I would invest 30%, 15% on general things in my life and the rest on my work.
Unironically this.
this
50% toward my student loans, 50% into cryptos.
