MONERO MOONING!
When's this shit gonna dip?
Need to buy more but don't wanna buy at ATH.
Of course it's mooning.
Monero is the only coin that's actually worth anything
yeah... its the only one really worth over 1k, since its what the pedos and such actually use
it will test the breakout soon and dip for like maybe an hour before continuing up.
Thats literally your last chance to get in.
Do you even know what ATH means?Buying now would be the solution to buy before the upcoming new ATH
ShitcoinFUDstersNo retail use
literally the only coin for private online transactions and the only coin that out performed BTC consistently this year.Its actually one of the only crypto's being currently used for its intended purpose.
It doesnt have "plans" to get things going, they are currently happening.
