The bogdanoffs forced the chinese government to stop supplying bitcoin miners in china with electricity

So anyone has doubts that BCH fiasco was a last attempt push to make as much money as they could with their influence?
It's not flippenning, but a nice scam to cash out some major bucks on a failed project.
fuck you mother if you want fuck
Damn, you're right.
Looks like the Chinese "mining ban" is really about power plants directly selling electricity to miners.
It's illegal to bypass the state-owned power company that acts as a middle-man.
If anything this should level the playing field a bit.
4358302you retards, thanks to the new difficulty adjustment this helps bch, not btc
it's the opposite because bch can survive a massive hashrate reduction and still mine 10min blocks where btc is now fucked
This is the beginning of the end for core
These are chinks anon, the advantage on electricity costs they lose they will pass on x10 to the playing field from the manufacturing they control
the notice is nearly 2 weeks old, BCH was already helped
4357844This notice regards a single county in a single state.
It's basically>Production of bitcoin constitutes an illegal activity.
Power shall no longer be provided for this end.>t.
Sichuan Province Danba County power company>It's also a week old>It could also be a fakeNothing to see here
how stupid are you?if all the miners suddenly went to mine BCH, it would immediately (in the next fucking block) be too hard to mine again, making BTC more profitable.This will make it reach a balance, and BTC and BCH will both end up with 10 minute blocks on average
