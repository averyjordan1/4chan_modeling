Why is there people still buying confido on eth, WTF?
You didn't hear it from me, but it's gonna be up to 10Â¢ by Friday.
Just an easy x4
This board is fucked up.
It's worst than /b/
That's how deluded people are about crypto.
They think everything will go up given some time, no matter what happened to it.
Could you imagine if the devs suddenly broke their silence and had a really good excuse for going dark, and the project was back on?
And an excuse for faking their identities too?
Well not that.
Was this confirmed or something?
Yes.
Stole some dutch guy's name and the main dev's pic was actually a completely different person
Ouch lol.Why was this only found out after the fact?I found out when Sergey said his first word by the time I bought into the presale.
researching projects takes too much effort
Probably Pajeets who don't read ENglish too good so haven't heard the news yet.
