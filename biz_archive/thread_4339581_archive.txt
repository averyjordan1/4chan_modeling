Seeing that ETH is a rather reliable coin with fast transaction times, I was thinking about writing a simple arbitage bot which would allow for turning BTC into ETH on one exchange and then selling ETH for BTC on another exchange, with profit.
From the data I've collected it it would work very well, even despite the withdrawal fees.Is anyone doing something similar?
What are your experiences?
