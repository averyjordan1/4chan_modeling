Most steady coin during the last 2 months.

fiat
ETH "finished" kek
BCH
if by long time you mean next week then yeah
buy btc in the crash
XMR is the only real answer.
Most stable currency out there.
Ethereum is also a good bet
Bitcoin cash.
Yes, however ETH is overrated and XMR is still underrated.
So.
Many, Things.XMR ETH NEO ARK VTC XLM XRPor any number of tokens etc.
in the short term
ETH supports the same privacy tech as XMR since Byzantium upgrade, so why should XMR not fade into obscurity as ETH becomes more mainstream?
Legitimately curious.
IOTA you newfag
BCH, you think we're done here?!
