Fun is a guaranteed 2x by next month.
It's literally free money.
And there's barely any hype behind it.
have fun with your PR manager who has been involved with BTC since 2009(with a btc mining hw company no less) and cannot be found on the funfair.io team page because he asked to be removed.totally not suspicious for a business2business venture that would put him in a position to speculate on future news that only the team is aware of (partnerships, new casinos etc)
Fuck off pep.
Alex actually runs the Funfair Telegram admin as well so im not really sure if you're trying to suggest he doesnt want to be associated with it?
if so you're wrong
just topped up to 100k FUN

I don't understand what this is.
I still have heavy multi bitcoin bags OF Fun from the 600s.
FREE MONEY FOR POORFAGS for doing Pajeet-tier tasks, FUN is given at a great rate currently.
What exchange did it reach 600 on?
He doesnt 'run' the telegram, he is just a moderator there.
Can you find him on the team page on funfair.io (of a team of 30 people) ?
This is relevant because he was removed after people started asking questions about his role

privacy in cryptocurrency is a big draw for its use>question why someone wants to have their privacy retained
