Browsing /biz/ and seeing all these panicking faggots and core shills, I was somehow reminded of this Warren Buffett quote.
Warren buffet also said that Bitcoin is a bubble and that he is never going to invest in it you retard.
He never actually said that
Of course Bitcoin is a bubble you fucking deluded corecuck.
That's why you should switch to its superior counterpart.
its also a good way to lose money.
