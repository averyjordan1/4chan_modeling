https://etherdelta.com/#NVO-ETHLiterally just addedNow on ether network at super discount, volume already building upsuper early find
what was ico price ?
i dont think there was one
https://nvo.io/
for me it looks like a dead coin but on ED it's at 0.00029 and on the other exchange it's at 0.028 so maybe it will x3
Ok they did have an ico, but on CMC its 40 cents ED its 10 to 15 cents
they are different... cmc is nvst
check the contract its the same guyswith a bigger team, and it looks like only 4 million circulation
could be they integrated an ether network exchange
delay after delay on their deadlines, key team members have gone and done another ICO.
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1917456.1960 SCAM
reading bitcointalk seems like a shady project
eh fuck it exchange Q1 and its on discount with potentially way less token circulating high risk high reward
BULLSHIT.
Anons stay the fuck away from this, it's such an obvious scam by OP trying to sell his copycat coin.>The website points to "http://nvotoken.ga/" a replica version of the official website "https://nvo.io/">Check EtherScan.
He holds ALL the fucking supply.
All 40mil of them.STAY AWAY ANONS.
Don't fall for this shit.
What's even worse is that NVO is trying to create a decentralized exchange using Counterparty's protocol.
NOT Ethereum.
They would never build an ERC20 token.Seriously don't fall this obvious scam.
Kek um no anon i didnt make this token
Well with the way you are shilling it here, can you blame me for assuming you created this scam?
i wasnt shilling, i just pointed out it was just added and had building volume already at a cheap price
Chill out only 4 million in ciculation
