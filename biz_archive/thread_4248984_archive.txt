for you paranoid lunch money gamblers:1. hedge fund(s) / institution(s) / whale(s) / whire males want to buy spot2.
for big players, BFX is the only place to buy because it's the only place where liquidity isn't shit3.
can't wire money to BFX directly due to their banking issues.
don't want to go the legal route (BFX offers legal services for big enough players to enable getting funds on the exchange)4. instead, players wire funds directly to tether (https://tether.to/)5. wire(s) hit.
tether credits USDT to accounts.
additional USDT is created ("printed") during this round as demand > current supply.6.
USDT is sent to BFX.
BTC is bought.7.
anon posts a chart showing BTC being purchased after tether being credited, and mistakes correlation for causation
kek this tether shilling feels like a linkie thread
like i gain anything "shilling" tether you poor aspie
You got a good point there.
Now let's see how the FUDers respond.
Can I get some proof with that?
