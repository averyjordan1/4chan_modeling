If you aren't at least 50% in Monero you aren't going to make it.
Have fun wagecucking the rest of your life.
Don't fall for the Bcash meme, this is literally a repeat of the fud manipulation used to pump Bcash after the August fork.
Whales are buying cheap BTC, while they drive up Bcash.
Eventually they'll dump on the cucks and move back into BTC.
Meanwhile, Monero is the only real crypto being used on the darknet markets, web browsers are mining Monero to replace ad revenue, and most normies have never even heard of it yet
I already have 10 vegas mining it brah.
It is really something that most people are running after the fastest profit and biggest hype instead of just accumulating XMR.
Good for me I guess, more time to get cheap morones.
I use some other altcoins to create some extra profit as well but in the end it all goes to increasing my XMR stack.All hail XMR The King.
dump everything you have into bch for the next 3 days.
then gtfo.
