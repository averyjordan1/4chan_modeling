yup.
this and ETP are going to kill it.bitfinex doesnt add shitcoins for the present time, remember that.
Maybe if it was ChainLink, how is that going for you?

>ico at ~$3>price now $2
Oh look, it's another retarded wallet shitcoin.
And the wallet can't even accept BTC until the next year or so hinting what kind of inept pajeets are hired to code for this scam.Stay away from it.
Trading on BitfinexAnd it still can't moon?
When I say moon I mean "at least 1 cent above ICO"?LMAO
