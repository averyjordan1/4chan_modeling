Bought PWR with my 28 BCH right before the flippening because BCH wasn't doing fuck all for weeks.
Right after conversion BCH slayer went full swing and now I'm down 10 fucking K. If I didn't FOMO into fucking ass PWR I would have been up 10 K by not doing anything fucking hell.
r.i.p in peaces
You bought a token that had gone up 5x in the last week already, and sold BCH when the difficulty adjustment was just about to switch again.Do you realise that you don't actually deserve your money?
>"BCH wasn't doing fuck all for weeks"where the fuck have you been?
Or does being an ADHD riddled autist distort your sense of time?
you WERE warned
I was feeling bad because i lost 200 but now i feel betterthanks OP
Thanks for taking one for the team m8, its a universal law that when a /biz/let sells one of his long held assets it moon booms.
Chin up old bean.
God damn I can't be the only one who justed himself.
C'mon anons I know you're out there no shame in this post your stories.
> buying a coin that's up 1000% in a month
didnt you notice the clear 2 week cycle?
when btc difficulty adjusts miners switch to bch until eda kicks in then hop back on btc while its about to die and loaded with tx fees
are you fucking retarded?
PWR looked to have higher probability to 2x than BCH when I made the switch.Now BCH is x1.7 and PWR is x1.I want to fucking kill myself.
Just hold it.
Its probably going up soon.
P2P is gonna jump when he drops powr and after all the news articles recently all the normies accounts getting verrified and reading up on crypto...
I don't think the hype of POWR has even begun.The hype with POWR was just us.. day trading on it and making some coin on the knowledge it's a safe bet and 2 years from now likely $100+
nigga hodl for 7 months and youre rich
