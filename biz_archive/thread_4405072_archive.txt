Why do they exist?
What's the point of them?The way I see it all people should just buy bitcoins and HODL to be eternally rich.Why do people keep falling for shitcoins?
Because everyone is greedy and want to get on the next big thing.
They want to buy something worth 25 cents and have it be 10k by the time they get back from the rub n tug.
That's why shitcoins
I've made 7 BTC this year trading altcoins.
He started with 10 though.
Shhhh...
No, that's profit, I started with 2.5 and now have 9.6, I just rounded down.
Yeah, get in on the next bitcoin.
Ripple is notoriously famous for that(after all fags think it's gonna be the next btc becaus btc too started at cents per piece ))))
How much do you trade with and how much is in storage?
Because Bitcoin is an overvalued shitcoin with no real propose anymore.
Value is what someone assigns to it.
You have enough people believe something is worth something and it is.
When I was 8 years old (40 years ago) I managed to make Stickers and American Express Flyers that I found in thousands by the box in thrash a school-internal currency.Every fucking schoolboy wanted some of my worthless stickers and flyers.
After 3 weeks we traded breaktime snacks and even real money against this shit.Teachers/School stopped it after 5 weeks because some parents complained.People are stupid.
