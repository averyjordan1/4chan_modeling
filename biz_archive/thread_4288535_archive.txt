Why isn't ETH king?
It seems better than BTC in every way
because market is full of greed and retards
Eth would be a friendly king.
Ico sell pressure
Because somebody who knows nothing about Solidity can just send kill() command to a contract and siphon off 300 million dollars?
That's a wallet problem, not ETH's.
Just use myetherwallet and nothing will happen
Network effect.
Bitcoin has the most hodlers.
Bitcoin Cash also inherits those holders.
't was just an accident bro
The problem lied in the contract, not the system.
A programming language isn't bad just because you write bad code.
Give it time, friend.
There are a lot of interested partied trying to keep Bitcoin on top.
It won't stay there forever.
It will easily surpass BTC in 2018.> screencap this check digits for confirm.
Because it isn't meant to be an actual currency.
it'll probably pass corecoin at some point, but still be #2
well, it's better than btc but it shouldn't be kingit's not secure, cheap or fast
thisyou are correct but it's more than just a currency.ETH has a lot of company backing.
it isn't going to fail and it isn't going away.
There's tons of companies that have started development on ETH now that Z-snarks ensures privacy.
that's what they waited for.
BITCOIN IS DROPPING AND IT WILL CONTINUE
lets face iteth is the futureliterally costs less than a penny to send thousands of dollars in 30 seconds
lol, if ETH surpasses BTC it'll only be because BTC crashes and burns.
they didn't siphon 300 Million, they simply locked it in place for infinity.
Why retards keep using parity never ceases to amaze me.
hodling for eternitykek
eth is a piece of shit tech, it's buggy as hell, more centralised than ripple, has no adoption except ico bullshit, the only positive point that i can't think of is the anti-charismatic leadership (that is btw completely false to cypher-punk ideology)
eth is not a currency.
eth is fuel
buying gas when he could be buying a rocket
That will also happen.
