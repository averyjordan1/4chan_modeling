>portfolio currently 55-60% BTC depending on market>concerned about Bitcoin's recent parabolic growth and its sustainability>concerned about the potential tether fiasco>long term concerned about Bitcoin's future due to outdated techConsidering moving my entire BTC stack over to Monero.
The potential for 2-10x gains are FAR higher.
I am also very keen on the idea of my wealth being totally anonymous and unknown to anyone except myself, so it is kept safe regardless of what may happen in the future.On the other hand...I *like* owning bitcoin, since it is the king of crypto...I guess I am asking for advice as well as general discussion relating to BTC and XMR.
There is only one king.
I'd probably hold both until the future is more clear
I like xmr, had it for a while.
The thing is, if btc goes down, everything is going down.
tfw i want more xmr but i don't have fiats
4487535Problem is I can't afford to buy any significant amount of XMR without liquidating my BTC.
I don't want to split my BTC stack, I'd rather shift all of it to XMR or none of it.
And bitcoin's recent massive rise is looking more and more unsustainableTrue, but XMR typically is less affected in proportion to BTC
Bumpany other thoughts
i got like 6000 XMR, hold it faggot, its full of intelligent people since they're all cyber criminals.
4487846How the crap have you got 6000XMR??
Also I have to GET xmr first, the question is should I replace my BTC stack for monero
Monero is a bluechip crypto.
All bluechip cryptos won't have heavy mooning.
That's where alt-coins are.
But you'll be pretty safe with good gains on bluechips anyway.
Yeah I'm not looking for an overnight 5x or a monthly 100x.
I'm looking for anywhere from 2-5x over the next...6 months to a year, say
And it's looking like monero might be more likely to provide that than BTC.
Plus it's less vulnerable to market hysteria and tether scandals and its anonymous
