why do alts crash when bitcoin goes down?
i know everyone on here plays by the satoshivalue meme but truly in your heart you are after them fiats.
why doesnt everyone just set their sell orders for the previous fiat value in btc after a crash?
i assume most people investing are somewhat intelligent so is this some kind of mind fuck that nobody realizes or what?
>previous fiat value on btcSo, satoshis?
I don't get it
Because by far, most alt coins are basically tied to BTC.
You can't even trade any of them with fiat, you have to convert to BTC or such first.Whenever there's some moon planning, people just shuffle over to the alt, and then back again when it's over.They intrinsically have no actual fiat value.
And no, USDT doesn't count, good luck exchanging that for fiat.
