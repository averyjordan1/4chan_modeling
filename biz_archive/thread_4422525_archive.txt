On Monday, if China actually does come out and say that NEO is going to be the official smart contract platform, what will happen to the price?Especially if they ban bitcoin mining, but allow NEO staking - It's going to be insane.Will we see it break $100 before December?I can't believe I invested in this shit just because of the ant logo
300$ should be possibke?
