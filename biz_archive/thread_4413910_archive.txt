Volume is increasing drastically on Binance, and there's buys of the same amount happening over and over again.
Looks like someone knows something and is accumulating.
Sell order is put up, and snatched up immediately.
Seems like nuls is just exchanging hands.
Anyone know of any news?
>and there's buys of the same amount happening over and over againThat's the arbitrage bot balancing the eth and btc trading pairs you fucking retard lmao.
That explains the dramatic increase in volume?
False flag guys, thery’re running a competition on Binance, the winners is who made the most volume of exchange (including selling) so it’s basically a whale selling and buying to himself.
Perhaps in anticipation of some action related to the release of revised whitepaper in a few days & kucoin listing tomorrow.
Still I think I fucked up by anticipating that this wouldn't be like NEO or Waltonchain in the initial period, market interest isn't really here
