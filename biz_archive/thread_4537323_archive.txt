Just started(small), any advice?
>ATH: portfolio editionThe goal is not to FOMO, anon.
Not to FOMO.
LINK is a meme that's had its pump.
You'll be waiting a while for that to improve with fatgays marketing.
XEL is an odd pick given your taste but it's the best of a bad bunch.
Proud of you mate.
The biggest advice I can give you is don't show any loyalty to coins and don't listen to cunts who try to make you feel bad about selling or buying something.
Emotions fuck you up in this shit, so just take wins where you can get them and don't give a fuck about idiots trying to make you feel bad.My biggest loss in this shit was a coin that I held onto after criticising its team on Twitter and someone said I wasn't a "real investor" whatever the fuck that means
Buy req nerd

Putting 0.5ETH in the ''ETH LEND'' ICO, Good idea?
