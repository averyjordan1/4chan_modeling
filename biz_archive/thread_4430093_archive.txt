Well after waiting a week and a half my deposit finally posted.
What do I do now?
I missed bitcoin at 5500 because deposit was pending.
I missed bch too.
Wait for the price of bitcoin or eth to drop?
Buy etherium and transfer to a different exchange to buy what altcoin?
Buy BTC at any price and increase your stack thru altcoins.
buy eth and send it to bitfinex, then buy etp.
the chinks are going to start trading soon and etp has more growth potential short term than neo.
are there a lot of fees with altcoins?
what exchange should I go to
you're lucky it posted.
ive been waiting for a 2k bank wire for over a month.
Don't buy bitcoin I sold everything 2 days ago bitcoin is about to have a big correction
or buy monero right now.
there's big news soon and a decent pump.
I hope so, and when it does.
I will buy the dip
