rip your money broHow much did you put in
% of my stack
haven't seen a waves post since late spring
nuls will replace waves permantley lmao waves is just a erc20 shitcoin
Lol, naysayers...just wait.
November is Waves month.
(I just sold mine for .00084 btw)
it's not an erc20 token retard haha.it's ethereum 2.0also nothing will replace waves short term.
you guys said the same about so many coins, but waves stays in top20 market cap.
partnerships with deloitte, big banks and governments.
but you morons only care short term about gaining 20 bucks on a pump&dump why care for actual projects like ether, waves, stratis and so on
It kinda makes me happy that Waves isn't discussed on biz....kek.
I'm looking at you, chainlink...
