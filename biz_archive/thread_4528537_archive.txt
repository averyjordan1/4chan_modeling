Dragonchain's preliminay audit is complete.
Who here is waiting on them Dragons.
Me.
Any news on exchanges?
I want to buy.
Well no one has the tokens yet, they are doing an internal and external audit prior to release.
Since the tokens are proportionally distributed (cap/contribution) I suspect it will be a while.
