>people talk shit on USD tetherIts literally the most useful crypto right now.
Allows you to quickly exchange your coins to a stable hold and back again without the hassle of connecting your bank
Its fake internet money.
Its a useful tool that allows exchanges to function so hopefully they don't fuck around with it too much.
I would never actually try to have my tether redeemed.
I would buy BTC and sell it on cuckbase for big boy dollars
Tether is such a scam.You can't actually redeem them for 1USD, they are just worthless.
its USE CASE is to be used as a dollar value.
Because so many people trade it daily, its value is true.
You arent supposed to cash out your tethers to real dollars, its a tool for intraday trading, thats its use case
I would never actually try to have my tether redeemed.What do you mean 'try'?
Nobody is able to have their tether redeemed.OP, just realize that if Tether ever decides to tank, the Tethers will become worthless in a matter of minutes.
The exchanges will tell you to go home and cry.
The Tether agreement says they have no value.But indeed, until that day, the Tethers will be very useful as a trading pair, just like you could use a golden hand grenade for trading.
Just try not to get caught holding it when it goes off.
send eth or ltd to gdax>convert to eurThats it, I occasionally use tether but never goes to sleep while having my funds in tether, those are for daytrading.
Tether has literally printed 430 million USDT in the last six months.
