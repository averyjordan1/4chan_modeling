What exchanges and wallets do you guys use?
How do you guys convert local currency into crypto and crypto into local currency?
What do you do about taxes?
I use Mycelium wallet and Bittrex.
I have not yet cashed out, but have bought BTC at an ATM, on Coinbase, and on LocalBitcoins.com.
I am sub $150, so I have not thought about Taxes at all.
When the time comes, the feds will already be on my tail.
Myetherwallet for ERC20 Tokens and ETHPaper wallets or hard ware wallets like nano s if you wanna be real safeCoinbase is a good shit for what you are looking at, but insane feesDepends on where you are living.
A lot of different tax rules are out their right now, better be more specific
ExchangeYoBit and whatever>WalletsDepends on the currency, I use Electrum for BTC>local currencylocalbitcoins>taxesnot a concern where I am during trading, but if you're holding and it's enough to be taxed, try to anonymize it and not declare
im a newfag and i have no idea how to trade crypto, the one thing thats holding me back is all the damage scammers and hackers have done, hoping to find some good info in the comments tho
Good luck with the suits.
Why did you pick Mycelium and Bittrex over others?
4449805Thanks for the replies.
I live in Commiefornia.
All those qt cryptos of yesteryear :3
first understand what you're dealing with, read and watch something about how cryptos workthen i would suggest to buy some BTC and invest in minor coins on long termfor exchange look up gdax, gemini, cex.io, yobi.net.
if you want to go for the fast lane start with coinbase but they charge ridicouls fees lolalso wallets are pretty much the same, i use electrum and blockchain
No reason.
I've had a Mycelium wallet for years, and Bittrex has simple UI.
