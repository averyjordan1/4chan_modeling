Dropped it yesterday, may pick some up if there are signs of life later.
It's a game coin from an established company but it will see value from use, not speculation.
Lots of bagholders due to shitty ico structure.
Bought in ICO and also bought more for Binance comp and sold both for minor profit.
It keeps mooning so whateverYou think I should wait til btc drops during operation dragon slayer?
Same boat.
Feels bad man.
I'm at an 80% loss right now so just going to hold it.
