I'm a /sci/ bitchbut if i read the whitepaper correctly there is a 350,000,000 POWR circulating supplythat goes up to 1B.
I work for a small solar power company and we go through well over 750,000,000 solar transactions per year (in Germany).
Perhaps the coins mean nothing and this is scam.
And can they add another billion solar coins after this?
Or they should be valued at the price of a years' worth of transactions from solar 8521.88 with the cost of a kit/install factored in.
lmfao this coin could dump and it'll just keep going upim comfy as fuck @6700

It went up to 9000 but I kept holding even through the drop and didn't sell.
