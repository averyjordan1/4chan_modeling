New wave incoming fags.Get in, raiden on binance
comfyfagbro reporting
what market cap do you see this reaching?
80 mill right now seems low for a project of this level
Dare we tempt a 200MM market cap?
seems totally doable to me, PIVX, TenX level is probably low honestly
exactly.
people are bitching "muh high mcap".
Do you think garbage projects like ICN, Gnosys, DGB deserve higher marketcaps??
?Also its fucking R-A-I-D-E-N .....im not lying i will get out once i have my 80-90% gains but eaven if you hold it, you should feel totaly comfy about it
It's a 500 millions marketcap by the end of November.I'm not even kidding, this will be the major channel of payment for Ethereum since all the rest is basically vapoware at this stage (Plasma).If you don't hav HUGE FOMO right now then you hate money.
yep im sorry i havent checked binance during the day today (eurofag here) and saw it listed only a few hours ago, could have made sooo much money....well ill still make some nice gains
I'm like you, found it on Binance just few hoursago, however Raiden has been talked about for so long and solves such a massive issue that it's basically a mythic creature at this point, it's guaranteed top 10 on the mid term.

Surprised I'm just learning about this, got into the game last month.
Should I go all in?
FUCK I'm nervous.
How viable is this coin?
I almost feel like saying fuck it on Binance and going 100 fucking percent all in on RDN
