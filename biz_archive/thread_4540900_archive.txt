The JUSTs just keep comingWhen BTC went from like $4500-7k+ all my alts got fucken wreckedbut I held most of them like a dumbass, now ETH is mooning while my alts pretty much stagnant.
I literally had multiple opportunities to sell while BTC was first mooning, or even sell into ETH after, and I would be up like 100-200%+ compared to where I am right now.
Instead I'm holding LINK bags like a fucking clown.
Link will pump in December with bittrex listing.
Sell at the high, and make gains elsewhere.
Get back into LINK in 2018.
I sold all of my link at the latest pump to get out and I've already made half my losses back.
Don't be a bag holder and get emotional.
Wait till Litecoin pumps when you're out of litecoin.
Link will pumpLink will never pump
The only thing LINK will do is flush further down the drain.
