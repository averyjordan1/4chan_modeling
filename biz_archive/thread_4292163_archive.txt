HOLY SHIT
I can imagine, did several 10btc trades on this, now at 14 btc
It's over, btc is dead
When was the last time a coin passed BTC in volume lol?
THE FUCKING FLIPPENING
only Ethereum did that
litecoin has done it
I guess the thing to consider here though is that BCH just passed BTC in volume at one of the most high volume eras ever for BTC.
THE KING IS DEAD LONG LIVE THE KING
you cna LITERALLY see the flippening in the charts
4292208Bch passed bitcoin at the last ""flippening"" tooIt's not the first time its overtook btc volume
LONG LIVE THE KINGBlock stream has been blocking the stream of money LONG ENOUGH I SAY.

Newfag here sorry, I'm up 2.5x right now
If you hate money do what 4chan tells you to do.
What a lesson you've learned Anon.
bitfinex.i closed short with 5% profit and went long at 995
It's just FOMO.
No new money.Some whale group initiated this pump and you guys just got dumped on at 1000.
Basically, if 4chan tells you to do something, do the complete opposite.
Noobies about to get burned
Even whale groups wouldn't be able to pull off an $7 Billion dollar pump
whats the word
n-nothing to see here guys!
its just the flippening!
we swear :):)
