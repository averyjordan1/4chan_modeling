Is it too late to get in???
Don't you mean too early?
all in?
It's pure speculation right now.
If you solely go by dividends then it's currently very overvalued and the volume continues to drop every day, but the hope of today's investors is that trend will reverse when they improve the UI, add more pairs and ICOs, and implement new features.
There's also the payment gateway and fiat exchanges which will contribute to the revenue.
It's pretty low now but never assume you're on the floor just because you're low.
If you want to go all in then spread your buys out over the next few weeks because there's still plenty of time for it to go lower before it goes higher.
Its mad cheap rngo for it m8
I love checking my dividends every week.
It just adds a little happiness to my life when I see how much of each coin I earned on the dashboard
