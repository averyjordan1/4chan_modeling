Why do we waste our time and real shekels on dumb fucking altcoins that ruin us financially and emotionally?Why, wheh ol' faithful BTC has done nothing but climb, dip, and climb harder?WHY is it so addictive to just waste our energy on alts?
Why do you do it?
Because we all just like getting fucked anon
fundamentally believe BTC is a shitcoin and will crashproblem is its gonna crash the whole altcoin market so fucked either way

Yeah btc is so much better than shitcoins like powr which I bought for like .11 a week ago thats now .68.
Have fun with your "big number value coin" that makes you believe a .5% gain is big news.
its all nice till you become a bagholder
a couple of altcoins gave me huge gains, but instead of selling at the top, i fell for the hodl meme...this bitcoin rally really fucked me over.
i'm worse of than when i started, it's fucking crazy.you think that if you hodl long enough that alt will shine again one day, but then you look at charts of other coins and see the same pattern.
inital moon, then a crash, and a slow bleed into nothingness.
Why, wheh ol' faithful BTC has done nothing but climb, dip, and climb harder?Of course BTC will climb hard.
It's artificially pumped with the Tether.
Once this Tether bullshit explodes, you'll see the real value of BTC.
except for whoever is chosen to flip
Speak for yourself, I made more than $2K in a month
