And here comes the moon, da na na na naah
pumping hard.
i told you losers to get in at .03
probably going to at least 0.05 tonight.
fuck why did I sell at .04
Ive been following the volume for like an hour and its been sky rocketing.
lol its going back to .07 and really freaking fast.
You can literally watch the minute by minute chart and its just going up faster and faster
god i hope so.. where are you following it at?
im using bittrex but ive heard its a lot different in some exchanges
It's shit.
Why the hell would anyone buy this?

to make money dipshit.
who gives a fuck about the coin.
following minute chartanon....
When did this happen?
I've been holding BTC on Gdax, can I claim BTG?
i sold mineyou think you are making money until you see the sell price.not worth it.
its been on bittrex less than 10 hours lol.
and its climbing fast enough to warrant minute to minute.
Bittrex, it has over 40% of the total volume so it pretty much determines the price once it levels out and its going higher very fast.
easiest money I have ever made.
Bitcoin Gold is the real Bitcoin
Guys this is the coin that was delayed release so devs can premine 100,000 BTG from split to release day.
That is 30 million right there.
yeah they made a smart play.
I'm just also benefiting of its random hyper moon.
Already went from 200-400 in 20ish minutes.
