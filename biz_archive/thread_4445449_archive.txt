Regardless of Pajeet pick of the month or not - what's the general consensus on this, how high will it go?
I'm worried about its astronomical supply...

virgin??
Looks pretty solid.
Buy in cuz there's just no way it could plummet lower than it is now.
it means you no sex ever

There are 350mil tokens in circulation.
1 Bil total supply but those haven't been burned.
Meaning a 1Bil market cap limits it to $1 correct?
What's going on with the 650mil tokens left over it'll suppress the price?
Pbc would be stupid to announce this coin.It's went up 100% just based of speculation.
Imagine how pissed members would be.
It would ruin their reputation.Maybe it WAS the pick.
No way he keeps it now.Monday will come and this thing will drop AT LEAST 50% when it's NOT the pick
Unbelievable that you people are so deluded and smalminded that you think this pump had anything to do with PBC.Powerledger is just available on the market an is already making big steps.
they already have a product, they already did their research before the started an ICO.Are you people this stupid ?POWR is gaining traction because of their ideas and products not because of a idiotic fraudulant PND group.
Ok shills what is the next buy in point for this shitcoin so I can get some
