Anyone else have a problem that everytime they put a decent buy order in at the low prices like high .15's, two orders always appear before it so it doesn't fill?
just do market buy instead of limit unless youre daytrading
this is called accumulation.

I do the same.
Each time it dips below 16 I try accumulation (preferably around 15.75, and the price always immediately spikes back to 16.
Just wait a day or so with the order open at a price that it swings too, eventually it will get filled.
Someone doesn't want the price to drop below 25 cents.

Bots prey on those that are not patient and it works because it makes idiots cancel their orders and place them higher

Oh, okay.
