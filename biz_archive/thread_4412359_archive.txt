I bought this coin years ago at a penny and its amost $5 now.
I am not selling until its four digits.This the ONLY coin in last year that is not an ERC20 shitcoin and has developers.Buying Skycoin in 2017 is like buying Bitcoin in 2012.I think Skycoin will surpass Bitcoin if the devs get even 10% done.The Skycoin developers are gods.
They have the developers of Bitcoin and ethereum.Chen who wrote the Skycoin white paper was the founder of Ethereum.
He wrote the first version of Golang Ethereum and then did Skycoin.You should google the devs.
I dont know why this coin is not ten billion dollars already.Skycoin has a full programming language which is an Ethereum killer, a DEX, blockchain social media, a new consensus algorithm and a meshnet.Skycoin is the juggernaut coin.Skycoin will explode like byteballs did.
Its inevitable.
Skycoin is not a moon landing, Skycoin is the death star.
It is the moon with a laser on it charging up to anihilate small planets.
thanks just sold 100k
