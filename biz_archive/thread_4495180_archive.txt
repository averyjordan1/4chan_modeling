Greetings anons i know you are always thinking about your sweet Lambos but what happens to your Lambo when you die.
That s why I would like to introduce cryogen.me they are a cryonics company that is locating operations in Switzerland and is currently having a presale.
Why though does basing their operations in Switzerland make cryogen special.
Well one of the biggest challenges of cryonics is that they cannot "freeze" your brain until you are pronounced legally dead.
What this means is currently it is very likely but the time they are able to "freeze" too much damage as already been caused for cryonics to be effective.
However Switzerland allows euthanasia.
What this means is they can start the freezing process while you are still alive at the end of your life or before your brain deteriorates I.e.
Alzheimers.
Look I can't promise you a moon mission with this ico but this might actually give you neets a shot at immortality.
You're welcome.
nice try OPor should I say MR.
FREEZE
I really want to be woken up when they have realistic sex robots.
So being a neet doesn't mean forced celibacy
