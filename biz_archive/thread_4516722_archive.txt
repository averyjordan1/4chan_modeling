There's gonna be some dip in BTC this weekend with the whole Project Dragon Dildos right?
Been waiting for a dip, it keeps fucking staying at around $8.2k>in before it does something crazy like totally ignore Project Dragon Dildos and go $8.5k+
going 10k on Friday you've been warned
>dipNo, there haven't been a spike yet.
Spike being 11-14k.
I'm not sure.
Bitcoin cash is going up and bitcoin REFUSES to go down.
Meme lines say Btc to 12k eoyDon't say I didn't warn you
bump
Unironically get in bch as a hedge and ride the wave.
No need to fight over symantics as the shills do
