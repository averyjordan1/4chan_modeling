How to alt coin?
Where are you buying these nuls or req, etc?Where do you put them?All I know is I think you need some form of another crypto like bitcoin to buy them.
I can get bitcoin on coinbase but it takes a week.
Don't.
Just buy ETH and hold that.
Alts are garbage.
better start now, then spend the week researching so you know which coins you want to buy once you receive your BTC
'alts are grabage'>recommends an alt
Why would coinbase take you a week to buy?
Just use a debit or credit card.
You can buy NULS on the exchange called "Binance"To buy NULS you convert bitcoin to BNB, then BNB to NULS.
No fees on that exchange for doing the transfer using BNB to or from.
Op buy EDO, don't buy PnD coordinated coins like NULS and all that other shit.
NULS isn't a pump and dump, the plan is sound.
Check info on telegraph etc
Don't you have to link a bank account?
