Ok folks , imagine that you are confy with your gains .
let's say a couple of million.
How do you transform 2 milion in btc to fiat in your banc account?
Set up accounts on exchanges with BTC/USD pairs and can deposit to bank accounts.
Cash out the daily maximum each day until you have your money outGemini doesn't have a withdrawal limit on wire transfers as far as I know so you can probably wire 500K every week.
Thanks anon.
imagine
You forgot >then wait for the IRS to send you a letter
Only if you don't pay your taxes.
You don't, don't you know?Money only goes INTO crypto, never out.
They make it nearly impossible to take it out.

pretty much this.
If you hit a moon a 15% tax is nothing
Only in you live IRS land
What do you mean you can't cash out ?
Move to germany (what a coincide I already live in germany) and let them pay out on my bank account there.
No taxes if held longer than a year because it's considered gamble then.
15%Try 35
I thought capital gains was 25%
Fuck me, I take all the risk that they reap 35%.
You need to be controlled anon, let the government control your money.
Your trades are still taxable anon.
Every single one.
You would need to hold it for +1 year between every trade to be clear
Just get your bitcoin onto a wallet and sell it to people in real life that you meet on social media groups.
No taxes, that way.
Cold cash.I'ts how we do that shit in Denmark land
It's called an offshore bank account ..Rookies baka.. Moving to some third world country when I hit the moon, somewhere with mountains .. 35% of my gains?
