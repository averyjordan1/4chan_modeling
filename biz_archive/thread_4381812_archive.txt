So if anyone wants to take a break from crypto discussions for a moment:I saw someone here a few months ago about jobs you can do from home, and freelance software testing came up.
Just wondering if anyone has any experience in this, and could point me to where I might get started?I'm actually a qualified programmer with 2 years experience (taking a break from that for the foreseeable future) so I'm fairly familiar with what QA jobs entail on a corporate level.
Is freelance software testing essentially the same?
(taking a break from that for the foreseeable future)enjoy being obselete and unemployable
i've done testing beforei used to test embedded systems software at a big corporationmendokusaiwhile it pays well if you're good at it its work that will make you miserable within the yearwouldnt recommend it
Yeah probably.In the short term though I need money to live and I don't want to work in McDonalds.
What do you do now anon?
neet trying to get my shit togetheri did some low-level implementations for a year after quitting the testing department but quit entirely two years ago
