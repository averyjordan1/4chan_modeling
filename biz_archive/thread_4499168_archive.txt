I am also heavily invested in BCPT, but your daily shitposts are useless, you make BCPT look like a shitcoin that has to be shilled everywhere.When they release their product and announce their partnerships we will see that thing going to the moon:So chill and let them make their thing.
Moon when?
excited!
I've never posted about bcpt and I've only seen one other post that got buried.
We're considering that shilling now?
