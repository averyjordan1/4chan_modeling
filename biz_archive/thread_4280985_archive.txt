tfw when too stupid/ lazy to calculate opportunity cost Good thing I cant do math
You morons should stop obsessing about what you could have done and focus on making profit NOW not in the past.I shouldn't even help you, that's how most of make money, abusing emotional retards like you.
think about it like this.
if you knew how much coins/stocks would go up and down all the time, you would be a billionaire in days.
we all make mistakes trading.
just gotta accept that.
for example id be sitting at about 200k right now if i stayed in several coins.
tfw i would be god emperor of earth if is just did the right thingsJUST
