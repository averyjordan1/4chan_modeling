>college dropout out of school for 5 years being a depressed piece of shit mooching off his family>no experience at all since I've been a lazy bum Fuck what do I put on my resume?
First work on yourself imo.
Happiness is a path to success, not the other way.
Find your pathway to inner peace.
>delete resume>claim unemployment/student payments>invest everything into crypto>laugh at your family from the driver side of your lambo in a few years timeNot hard, OP.
Work at UPS as a package handler and move your way up.
>ResumeJust live with mommy
Sadly this is it.
put your max kegel rep amount

a huge dickbutt image on your resume will make them understand.
just put something like "I look forward to working with you at McDonald's.
I have great people skills :)"it's really not that hard
i really don't know senpai, been a neet 2 years, luckily i don't need to get a job, got a livelihood in btc
How do you surive off bitcoin?
Coming from a poorfag who wants to be a neet.
Put your link marine rank.
That'll impress 'em.
i'm not living off bitcoin yet, living with my parents still but i'm covering my own expenses, i'm not moving out even if I could afford it cause it doesnt make sense since im autistic, also i still need btc to 3x to have enough money for life
Makes sense.
Good luck to you
Are you an American?
If so, just join the military desu.

Then your title changes from "loser son" to "deadbeat live in boyfriend".
Nothing will really change except now you're getting regular pussy.
