I have not cared much about Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the past.
Been mostly investing in some alts.
But the recent wave of the Core Squadâ„¢ insulting Vitalik is enough for me.
The never ending stream of posts about Vitalik being a pedo, "Bcash=BCrash" and "Roger Ver is teh antichrist" is really a sign that coordinated shilling and FUDing is happening on /biz/.I am now involving myself in the Bitcoin war and saying: "FUCK CORE SHILLERS".
You are bad for /biz/ and for the whole crypto community.
GTFOI see why a lot of people support Bitcoin and why a lot of people support Bitcoin Cash, but behavior like this is not welcomed on this board.
/biz/ used to be a better place with actual discussions, not a place to insult and only post memes
lol fuck off faggot.
what do you expect when your dev believe the earth is flat
not a place to insult and only post memeshave you missed the right bookmark?
coz this is 4chan
Of course there will be a lot of memes and insults, but it has gone way worse.About 2 years ago we go threads that lasted for days with people posting answers with actual arguments.
Now, every other post is 1-2 sentence long and telling the other guy that he is wrong and should KYS.
Shut the fuck up, /biz/ was never like that.
Kill yourself.
I have not cared much about Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the past.Cool, don't start now.
Saged.
this is cute, it is abundantly obvious to anyone with a functioning brain that the only professional shilling brigade this board has seen, has been from BCH - and it happened not just here, but across social media and multiple popular crypto forums.And now the shills are trying to create a narrative that "core" has a shilling brigade and is trying to make known fraudsters and communist faggots look badwhat a joke, go home pajeet.
youre wrong, kys
