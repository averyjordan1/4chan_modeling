Which exchange allows shorting and has A LOT of altcoins also?
I know bitfinex can, but it's just not enough coins/tokens.
Have you tried Bitmex?
You can short on literally every exchange
this is literally false
Wait is this all you can trade?
Did I just got trolled.
Can't on Binance, can't on bittrex.
You should probably stay away from margin trading
Absolutely agree.
