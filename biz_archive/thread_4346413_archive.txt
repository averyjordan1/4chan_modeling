My whale friends in their whale group all have very good evidence for Teeka picking POWR as the next coin.
These guys also told me about OMG, GAS, ZEN, XRP and FCT that Teeka talked about before it was shared.If you want to get in POWR i suggest you get in.Teeka's cousin is actualy on the POWR Team DYOR
Holy shit is this the next bitcoin????
Send me your email (can be throwaway)I'll link you the PBC doc on Thursday.FYI I received an email from PBC today and the short term coin was indeed BCH.
Pump's over tho, don't even bother.
I'm also certain that POWR nor STORJ will be "the coin" of the newsletter.
But I could be wrong.
We will see.
Will send it you and a few others just because I hate people make up shit to pump stuff artificially.
ThatÂ´s one ugly motherfucker...About to be rich...
fuck you you ugly shit
lol
No, this is the original vision of satoshi.
All others claiming to be bitcoin are alts.
something strange is going on with this man's head
meanwhile there's a crypto war being waged where millionaires are made & broken every hour.Fuck off with your corny ass shitcoin, the real men are playing USD, BCH, BTC.
I think he was an extra in the Cone Heads movie.
Teekas clone gone wrong here!HELP ME YOU FUCKS.Master Teeka is out the room and left my cage unlocked just long enough to shitpost before he comes back to ream my ayy looking asshole again.Will sharpie in the bloody poopshoot for keks.send help tho ay?

hahahahaha
wtf is this
THIS IS A COMPLETE LIE!
The email today said NOTHING about BCH!
The pick is NOT POWR.
Don't fall for this.
Nobody knows what the pick is before the newsletter.
