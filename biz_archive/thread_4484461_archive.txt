APOLOGIZE RIGHT FUCKING NOW
why tho

Buttrax has always been my favourite exchange.
fucking elaborate you fucking mouthbreather
4484478Bittrex was getting fudded like hell a few months ago, how they were stealing accounts, that the SEC was on their asses and they wouldn't add new coins because of this, etcThe only thing they did was ask for more verification.
The FUD stopped and new coins are getting addedMeanwhile, Bitfinex is ready to pull off Mt.Gox No.2
nothings changed, faggot.
People are still waiting on accounts to be unlocked you delusional good goy
Proof?
Bittrex IS a solid exchange.
The irony is it was Polo who turned out to be even more shady, been using Rex since 2014 and they've never had a hack or masses of people questioning why their withdrawals are taking days.
My only criticism is they still routinely list obvious pump and dumps.
Never had a single fucking problem with Bittrex.
It is my favorite exchange.
Easy and intuitive to handle.
I fully verified within like 3 hours.
That FUD is just retarded paid idiots from other exchanges I suppose or crying pajeets who don't wanna verify their shady accounts.So many other exchanges already made problems, like Poloniex "forgetting" 10 XMR, HITBTC not letting me withdraw.
About that shitty pathetic excuse of an exchange Kraken we don't even have to talk.Bittrex is just one of the best.
Not like they have influence of what coin is targeted by pnds.
They just have to add good coins now.
.25%
I fucking hate (((Bittrex))) they locked up my funds because "my name didn't matched my ID", but it absolutely did matched my ID, there was no error, I don't know what's the issue still but I've been waiting for 2 weeks with no response, I unironically prefer binance
Well they still list coins that have no obvious technical merit or lasting power while more serious and better coins like Raiblocks have still to make the jump to a bigger exchange, that is my biggest pet peeve.
