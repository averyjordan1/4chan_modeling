What was the circulating supply again?
Wasn't there supposed to be a CMC update and possibly a burn?
Someone here said what the circulating supply is but I forgot.
IIRC the market cap was like $1 million earlier but the price went up since
Circ.
supply is about 7M so thats pretty low...so market cap at curren price about 1M....but you can join our telegram if you have questions :)
If the circ.
supply is 7m, the current market cap is about 1.76m, actually (current EPY going price is ~.00079 eth)That's good to know though, thanks.
ugh emphy fucked me a few days ago.
dont waste your time with this I bought in a few days ago 0.0008 and had to sell 0.005. get in HST instead, it's mooning and they are dropping good news and exchanges soon.
They actually have a product too.
+1 on thisEPY is shit for volume, not moving atleast for now.
HST is hot and still hasnt mooned yet, been at .0009-.0013 for days
Damn, waaaaaayyyy too much shilling going on.
