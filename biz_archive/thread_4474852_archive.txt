Balina lists this at 75% and a pass tho
they see me rollinchaosismepkr@gmail.com
what were his criticisms
I believe small community and very ambitious.
He liked the advisors and token metrics
roll
Hmm, it is ambitious but they have the partnerships to do it.
They have establised roadmaps on medium and you can see from their telegram answers they have contingency plans for every stage.
As for the small community, thats what I'm trying to help.
It's small but dedicated
I mean I personally like ambitious under the radar projects so I already checked this out.
It is interesting that Tapascot and that Soros Fund guy are on board.
Also that wallet is sleek
roll again
4477055guys I already rolled trips, and OP already delivered4476648
absolutely, additionally, I've talked about them with their marketing plan, and while their ROI is ambitioys, theyll spend more to meet the numbers.
Marketing will begin with Jwallet release
lists this at 75% and a pass thoIn other words, they didn't give him a favorable pre-sale deal, asked him to prove accredited investor status (Balina probably isn't a millionaire), or thy denied him outright participation because he's American.
By the way, Jibrel is a PWC audited issuer of Jcash, which is essentially fully transparent, regularly audited tether, in multiple currencies :^)
hmmm so they stand to gain quite a bit when bitfinex's little scam falls apart
Yeah, seems rough but tether and metamask fucking up was pretty good news.
They didn't comment though.
These guys are waiting for regulation to come through, thats why everything they have is so clean and double checked.
Its a good hedge if you believe in the cryptopocalypse
The absolute fucking state of biz
DADDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY
rolling christophermurray@live.ca
4478568sir
And even more mess ups tonight hahaha
chadpomegranite@gmail.compls biz
This is so fucked but goddamn is it good knowing that tether will be purged out of the market.
Here's hoping bit connect is next
MOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM
Whats this about the US not being able to take part in the token sale?
Unfortunately US and chinese investors are not allowed in the token sale.
This is due to the SEC ruling for US investors
Any specific questions ask these guys https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@jibrel_network
Forgot to mention, Balina mentioned it was a 75 percent but ICO bench gave it their only 5 ever.
Its now 4.7 but thats still cream of the crophttps://icobench.com/ico/jibrel-networkPlus ico banker reviewshttps://www.icoranker.com/jibrel-network/
