Bitcoin is a store of value, the spiraling amount of unconfirmed transactions is a feature, its storing more value every minute!

Lack of transactions is a feature, if you could move your Bitcoin, you wouldn't be storing it :)
That's called an attack, bcashier.
Spam attack.
You could to the same to 8mb blocks.

Core Tactic #1: Deny The ProblemBlame nefarious actors for BTC's limited transaction capacity.
Transactions which push fees higher are necessarily "spam".
Use this to divert attention from the inherent limitations of 1MB blocks which represent slow confirmation times and high fees at today's transactional demand.
Blame anecdotes of high fees on user incompetence or wallet software, never 1MB blocks.
Far more costly.
When blocks are always full, adding just a few transactions drives up the cost because other transactions will otherwise be excluded.
Transactions are also backlogged significantly longer, making it much cheaper to carry out the attack.
When blocks aren't near their capacity you have to constantly add transactions, which are cleared out in the next block.
This makes an attack on 8MB blocks far more costly than on 1MB.
