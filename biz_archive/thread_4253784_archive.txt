Sweet news.
Lets just hope Dubai/UAE doesn't get involved in the Iran/Saudi Arabia war now.
Also tomorrow is the US trader doomsday isn''t it for bitfinex?
Let's see if that does anything to the price.
Unlike the other mooning alts, ETP has tons of news coming up short term.
It has a ton to gain, not to mention its still below $4 and was at $6.
Just that regain is 50% more profit.
Most comfortable hold right now.
Oh and I don't think trusting Draper would be the best thing of you're talking about Tim Draper since he also backed Bancor and Tezos, both Jewish scams that he profited from.
But I believe in Eric Gu though for sure he is legit.
What the fuck.It's at +20%.
don't act so surprised, friend
This is one of the best alts I'm holding, solid team.
