Just cashed out 15k on coinbase earlier today because there are 150,000 unconfirmed transactions and rising and there was no way I could get my bitcoin to an exchange before the flippening, so I'm about to buy all kinds of nice shit.What should I buy?
I have 60k in my checking account, but trying not to spend more than 15-20k.I have a lot of money in alts and ETH so I'm alright for now I think until this bitshit crap blows over.
Xfer to gdax is free and instant

Difference between plebs and smart people is that plebs always look to spend whatever they managed to come away with while smart people are looking at how they can what they have grow more.
