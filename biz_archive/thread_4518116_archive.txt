Who is the litecoin whale keeping a brother down at 0.0087?
Go fuck yourself
Man this coin is so stable, it could be used as a currency.Still holding some though, looking at the recent pumps of ETH, XMR and the like it should be our turn soon brotha
Which exchange?
kraken (getting off them, because they suck)
Litecoin's always been an easy rider.
Always putting my profits in LTC until the next investment opportunity, almost a 100% guarantee you still get some extra gains.
On hindsight wished I put it in ETH but you can't have it all.
Its CharlieHe needs walking hooker and blow money.
I really have no idea what to expect from litecoin if jihan and roger have another attack.I am thinking that ltc is a safe bet.
Its a stable currency that will hold value against BCH if by chance the flippening occurs.
If it DOESNT occur, then it should be moon time once lightning network gains traction
part of me want ltc to pumpbut at the same time i really enjoy it being stable because right now it's most useful crypto for payments and transactionsmaybe it should go to $100 and just stay there
id be okay with it going to 8k also though
