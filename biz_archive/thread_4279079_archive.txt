what are the best options?
NEO, LTC, XMR or something else?
i fucking hate this hardfork and pump&dump bullshit.
Unironically BCH
Wtc, Neo, Link, XMR, BCH
WTC just paid for my trip to Cabo
BTC ETH XMRLiterally everything else is a vaporware ICO shitcoin.
if XMR not up to $200 before EOY I will eat a shoe.
NEO just took a sweet little dip if you want to get in.
It's got a bunch of stuff coming up in the next couple months (DYOR) so it should have a few moon missions.
Won't be 5000%, but no risk either.
