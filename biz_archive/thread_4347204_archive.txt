Does anyone know how wealthy the queen of England is?
Not just net worth but investments, land holdings and other alike types of wealth.
She has $1
2M in BCH

She’s balls deep in LINK
She could buy the entire cryptomarket!
That’s the entire economy of the UK.
Not the queens wealth.
Not just net worth >but investments, land holdings and other alike types of wealth.Implying investments, land holdings and other alike types of wealth aren't calculated into your net worth.
Net worth is not synonymous with liquid assets
She technically has title to every property in much of the UK (except Scotland) as the citzens (her subjects) who think they have allodial title to the land that their property is built on, but they don't.
In other words, she's obscenely wealthy.
Must he nice to have youre land looked after by some nice old lady we Burgers have to settle for the cold bureaucratic Embrace of the government
everything belogns to hte queen
If you die without heirs or if you have a company that goes insolvent and is struck off, your estate or company assets goes to the Crown.

There hasn't been a Queen of England since 1707.
Or is Donald Trump President of Texas?
