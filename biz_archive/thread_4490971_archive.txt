Does anyone even fucking know about CSNO?
Jesus for such a dank ass coin, why is there no discussion anywhere?
Shh fker I'm accumulating
because it tanked below ico price and its only on literal garbage exchanges and will always be like that since its a dividend token and therefore illegal for any burgers to purchase
Its pretty much at 2x ico you retard
fuck off bagholderits still below ico in btc valueyou literally lost money holding this mess, even if you are up 2x on your fiat
How much was the first div?
illegal for burgersas if burgers care
they care when decent exchanges wont ever list it because its illegal for half their customers to purchasebrainlet
I put eth in at $28015% pre-sale bonus I'm literally cheering dude
Decent exchanges don't even accept Americans Lmao
Available exchanges do suck, but honestly if people want to buy something they will, it won't have too big an impact on the price.
I just hold and collect dividends.
I'm part time owner of a CSNO now lmao
Dividends come in January.
Buy now for free cash or buy late December when the price will be skyhigh.Nobody's gonna deny free money.
Dividend will be 0.5 cents per coin.
People thought it would be at least 2 cents per coin.
Going to crash by price/4 Screen cap this
