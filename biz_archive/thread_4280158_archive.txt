Purchased bitcoin low, want to cash out high.
What is the best way to get it into fiat?
Bitcoin debit cards have high fees, and I cannot wire to an American bank.
If I wire to international bank there is $60 fee from the exchange.
The cheapest way I have seen is to transfer bitcoin from one exchange to another based in a foreign country and transfer fiat from the sale of the bitcoin to a local bank in that country (a country that doesn't tax crypto) (I have seen exchange fees to bank account as low as .001 bitcoin.
Any ideas?
