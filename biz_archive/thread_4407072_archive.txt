Can't I just make a shitcoin, keep 70% of the coins and sell them all?
If yes, how do I make a shitcoin?Is this illegal?
you literally just described most altcoins
Yea.
Only keep 6 million in circulation.
Have a total of 178,000,000 though.
After you get listed announce a token burn of 177,000,000.
Boost the price then exit scam.
Only if you are Chinese.
ok where do I start though?
swallow coin.
take laxative = you have shit coin.
Copy and paste features from other white papers.
Then create a cool name, logo, and get photos of people off linkdin.
Make an ERC20 smart contract on Ethereum.
Then sell the tokens to people.
At the bare minimum, making a token AT ALL entitles you to at least $200,000.
If your token sounds vaguely useful double that to $400k.
If you can make a simple javascript demo of what your hypothetical product might look like then you've got a $2m token at least.
If you can get someone who wears a suit to be listed as an advisor double whatever value your token was at before.
If you spellcheck your whitepaper before publishing it, multiply value by 1.5x.
You need something distinctive to grt hype.
Perhaps you won't have a blockchain, or a Tangle, but a mix of the two ;)

Just hype shit on reddit desueven here
Always keep in mind that these coins are unregulated.
That alone drives a lot of behavior.
if I have a code where the fuck do I put it?
