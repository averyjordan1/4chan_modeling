THIS SHIT WAS LIKE 92 CENTS YESTERDAY AND NOW IT'S $1.08 BUT I ALREADY SPENT MY MONEY ON PAJEET'S FUCKING VERGE COIN HOW DO I KMS?!
The ICO is still going and it has been for over half a year so just join in whenever you want.
It's gonna run for like a year.
Another very big scam.
Really?
It looks like a normal staking coin to me, or am I wrong
It's from the founder of steemit and bitshares.
Do some research, this coin is interesting.
So what ISN'T a "scam" to you guys?
Exactly why I want in on it.
- Funding a blockchain before itâ€™s even released lol- No-cap ICO means the owners can "buy" as much as they like from themselves, i.e.
generate arbitrary amounts of EOS to dump on the market
