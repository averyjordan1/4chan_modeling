The price is going down in bitcoin as bitcoin's price goes up.
lol tether is always 1 usd.
how the fuck does USDT work again?i know it's always pegged at 1USDbut how do they get away with it?
The price of tether you brainlet
When you sell any coin for usd, it's that.
How fucking stupid can people be.
got a nice down trend, until the whale pumped the volume on nov 13, witch broke the second resistance mark and started an up-trend, if it were me i would sell off the profit at nov 15 and buy the next dip if the volume is shit.
USDT is coin which keeps it's value to 1$ or close to 1$ in any situation.
They control the circulating supply to maintain this value.
for every tether issued they put another dollar bill in the rumpus room.
it is perfectly safe
