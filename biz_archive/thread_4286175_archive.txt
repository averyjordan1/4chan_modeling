who should I use to buy BTC/ETH in Australia?
I tried independent reserve but they say I have to wait until post out a physical identification number before I can buy from them, So I'm literally just wasting money by not investing right now.>ITT:// Post your prefered AUS platform to buy crypto, explain why, maybe tell us about the fees and transaction times.Any good advice and I'll put 1 ARK in your wallet.
I know it's not much but your time isn't worth that much to me either.
Feels for you.
Hope you don't get snagged w fees.
Don't buy BTC, buy BCH....which is 8x faster and less fees.
Use BTCMarkets
Try coinjar 1% fee
BTCMarkets has a 0.85% exchange fee but worse rates.
Verification takes a while and depositing AUD takes 1-2 days.Coinbase has a 3.99% exchange fee but better rates.
Verification is very fast but has a weekly limit of 500AUD.Depends on how much you're exchanging, but BTCMarkets is usually only a few bucks cheaper.
the fees go down if you trade a lot, but resets to 0.85% after inactivity, i think.
