Poorfag hereWhat are some potential coins I can buy with for $10?

CHANCOIN will make you thousands in the future.

You still have a chance.
It's on Cryptopia...........we're going to be building an imageboard/crypto site in the future.
Don't be a broke bastard for too long.

Buy Bytecoin
You don't have to buy whole coins in most circumstances.
So $10 will buy you a partial coin of just about anything.

Don't even bother, fees will kill you.
Save up at least $500 before jumping in and don't buy whatever meme coin biz is shilling as the next moon mission.
i listened to you for some reason (also because cryptopia takes 0,002BTC fee for withdraw and i didn't have even that, and i was planning to buy ELIX with that.)
