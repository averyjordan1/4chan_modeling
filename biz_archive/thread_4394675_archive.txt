Binance rate was 4.5 and it even hit 6k for XRP you dumb fuck.
But they froze wallet conveniently so they can sell of their stack and then released the deposit funds from users around the world once the price drops.

also the token itself xrp does literally nothing.
the AE partnership is irrelevant
Can confirm.
Many complains in the telegram channel.
They didn't even announce wallet being frozen in their announcement page.
What a bunch of scums
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FUCK YOU BINANCE
Everyone in this thread has a small mind.
The day alts mooned they scammed me somehow even tho i had btc balance it wasn't letting me use full amount to buy
Since this is a Binance thread, can anyone confirm whether it's true that you can't withdraw from that exchange unless you get some app for 2FA?
Or is that only if for certain larger amounts?
Does WinAuth work?
All the exchanges are scummy as fuckThere's no legal repercussions so they can do what they want with impunity
