Made a port for my friend.
They will be a millionaire like me in 5 years.
Also, ITT post your portfolios.
Forgot some iota tbqh
Where the links
No link?
Your friend should kill themself for trusting you.
Link will not solve the Oracle problem.
A blockchain will.
Linkies btfo.
You dont need a coin for a blockchain.
HAHAHAAHAHAHAHH>diversify into 100000 coins with $500
Im a contrarian, fuck you deluded linkies, ark fags, and monero/dash cucks.
Just wanted to buy all shit.
Also UTrust ICO @21000 coins.How much you think I will have in a year?
Not my fault my friend is poor.
no linkinto the trash it goes
based on your selections i'd say 5k
Salt is a good betStrat mehADA is okay..
I think u bought highAll good bets except batshit.
I don't really like snt either.. but okay Ur gonna make it!50+kI agree with the salt allocation over others.
Yeah I agree ADA was bad move, bought it high.
I still see some potential.
SNT was a wildcard, I didn't even know the coin :D
So you think Link will be the next thing to grow?
Mind giving me a quick rundown of why, I read quickly about it and it seems to just be declining, or is that the fate of all new coins before they take hold?Or are you expecting the boom when people start utilizing crypto currency in day to day trading and is link the best option for that?
fuck ton of shitcoins>no ETH???
I have more eth than fucking bitcoin!
ADA has the potential to be one of the top 5 market caps, easily, within a year.2018 is going to be a significant year.You may have bought high short term, but hold on and it will be worth lots.
Yeah, you don't lose until you sell.
I'm not going to panic.
All in link is the only way to go.
How can u even function throughout the day with such a lack of brain cells.
So why Link and not Mobius?
No LINK or Req?
Rofl, goodluck finding food out of the dumpster in a few years you dumb money.
