> IOTAYou didn't listen last time, when I told you that we will see $0.90 in the next days.I hope you will listen this time when I say, we will see $1.24 soon.Buying spree announced.
Either join and profit, or keep holding your worthless bags.
I already bought 3k at 34 and sold at 99enjoy being poor, faggot, bc it's going back to 50, you can sell your bags to me then.
I did margin long from .34 to .98.
And shorted from there to .84.We are going back to the moon.
You decide if you want to be rich or not.
ok, let's see where this goes
Hope it goes down to 0.5, so that i can buy more iota for a cheap price
When will these cunts give us back our coins?
hahaha iota at 0.5 wasn't cheap, iota at 20 cents was cheap
Bitcoin at $100 wasn't cheap it was cheap at $50Die
IOTA under $5 is cheap.
This thing going to be more than $5 in 2018.As more and more people pile into crytpo they are going to look for the next wave of technology.
The next coin after bitcoin, eth.
That coin is IOTA
