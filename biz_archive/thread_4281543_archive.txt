They're not even trying to hide it anymore.
When the fork cancellation was announced 2 days ago, you couldn't send BTC, the send button would just keep loading but now that BTC is crashing and BCH mooning you can't send BTC again, this time showing any address as not valid.It is obvious that they are doing this on purpose, preventing people from selling BTC.
There is something fishy going on here, something huge, potentially to do with Bitfinex and Tether as well.Discuss.
