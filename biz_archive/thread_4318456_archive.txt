Still unable to understand that BTC will always win in the end..._always_.I...
I don't know what to tell you anon... You really thought this was the end?
After all we've gone through?
That two faggots who everyone hates are going to take BTC down?
That BTC and all the expectations the world has for it would just yield?Maybe take a step back, unwrap the tinfoil around your head and realize that we are way, way too far gone for something like what was suggested around here this past few days to actually happen.
Now dump your Cash if you haven't already.
Let's all agree this shitstorm has had its run and get back to the regularly scheduled programming.
