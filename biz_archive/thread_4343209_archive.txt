>He trades without suicidal leverage
Just put 20k on nintendo.
Should I start doing margins now
If you feel like you HAVE to trade, dedicate a small portion of your portfolio to hardcore gamblin!
It helps keep you sane and prevents you from getting itchy with your other positions.
The biggest mistake you can make is trading too much.
Stop feeling like you have to make a salary with your trades, just let the opportunity come to you.
There will be clear entry points in the future, even if there are none now.

I'm really starting to hate the US senpai.Not only because of shit like this, but because THEY FULLY TAX YOU NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO IN THE WORLD.
As long as you're a US citizen, Uncle Sam is going to track you down and make you fucking pay.
The only other country that does this in the entire world is Eritrea.
Fucking ERITREA.
germanfag here>tfw living in socialist shithole flooded with niggers>tfw even germanistan doesnt tax you on worldwide income>tfw zero taxes on crypto gains
I was in Germany last month.
Not a bad place, just seems a little soulless At least your government doesn't fuck you in the ass with worldwide taxes
They get fucked in the ass other ways.
However America is the last country on earth that should have the taxes it does.
My cousin cashed out of Coinbase and didn't pay a dime on it.
The Man never came after him.
That's the problem.
The problem is when you try to buy a house or car with that money, and they're asking where you got it.
*that's not the problem
just b urself and gains will come to you :^)
Tax is not easy in Germany.
DonÂ´t feel to safe in your position.
