Because hes a genius?
So lets say, right now if you want to buy X token @ ICO, you received a fixed amount of tokens per ethereum.
If this ICO uses chainlinks descentralized oracles you would received an amount of tokens proportionalmto the current ETHs price instead of a fixed amount because the contract would be able to check all that 3rd party data.
Is this correct?
Yes/No?
If the SC sets this rule, then it would pick the current value.If the SC does not set this rule, then you will get the current value based upon API telling you how much current value is.
Fuck you and your fucking experiment and shilling humongous faggotFuck your link (both)

I mean fixed price... at the second rule.

their address is an abandoned parking lot>rory is a convicted pedo>sergey is suffering from a rare autoimmune disease and is already facing multiple organ failure, the only thing extending his life right now are high doses of hydrocortisone (hence his weight problem).
