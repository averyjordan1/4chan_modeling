Holyshit, did anyone else start to notice how BTC in USDT is up AND all of the alts that trade under USDT?
Almost as if BCH has become the "Bitcoin" when it goes down, alts go up and vice versa.This is it, the true flippening where Bitcoin becomes a shitcoin and its alter ego takes the crown.
Bend the knee to your new king.
Hi Roger
Makes sense.
Bitcoin core is good for alts because its absolute shit compared to most of em.
The same cant be said for BCH.
people take their profits from bch and put them into alts.
I know I did
Shut up fag
