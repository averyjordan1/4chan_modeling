I put in 25% of my portfolio into POWR and now it's cutting into my BCC gains.
Should I sell it and go all in BCC?
Why the fuck is it dropping on multiple good news.
consolidation ?
sell the news is real
You're not kidding.
I'm going to hold on for another 2 hours to see.
I think BTC dropping is fucking it up maybe.
lots of ppl got out of alts to buy NEO today, actually that ruined powr's pump, it was going up but then fell off a cliff at 38k, hold and wait for monday and we'll be back on track.
What news
people actually believe in this non sense?
As for BCC it might be too late, who knows.
GL.
Otherwise maybe go in link or RCN.
