China is allowing ICOs again!NEO already moved, ETP is next!
holy phuck im finally getting rich yeaaah fuck chainlink boyos
It's just a matter of time when ETP explodes into 15-20$
Yeah, much, much larger ROI potential, than NEO.
Neo has 1b+ mcap.Etp has ~100m+ mcap.It's no brainer.
Reminder that Eric-Gu was neo cofounder and etp is massively oversold at the moment.
Literal no brainer, I'm about to dump a bunch of fiat into my long position on this shit.
Also, what a nice thread this is where we all agree and no one has any fucking fud because it's so obvious
you have to be absolutely retarded to not be in etpi'm not even shilling
yeah I don't hold etp but even I agree it's gonna moon hard soon
I want to buy this, but I don't want to buy on shit-tier sites like etherdelta.
What do?
Looking good on the 24 timespan.
Any sources on the pump?
Bitfinex, my friend
Man this is on Bitfinex not some shit ED.
And yes I agree, you'd be stupid not to be on ETP now.
This is so much better then Neo do some research.
B I N A N C EW H E N ?
HitBTC fool
No.
Show me, I fucking started yesterday.
Im hopped up on caffeine and greed
is it mooning?
A true /biz/nessman in the making.
But seriously I went 95 percent in at 1.30 and have been accumulating since.
ETP is the only alt (besides Ethereum or LTC) I feel safe holding.
Also it'll likely moon hard.
I love everyone in this thread.
I just maxed out my weekly fiat limits so I could buy more etp and double my position, I'm so confident and so is everyone else.
I know yall didn't forget about Metaverse :)
Wait... someone once told me if everyone shills on biz, then its time to sell.Not fuding or shilling here, but can anyone sell me on ETP with valid reasoning?
