I was telling you to buy when it was 0.05 - 0.1.
Now is the time to buy again.
Do it before Ver does.
Its over man.
BTC is mooning back to 7K and BCH is going to shitcoin purgatory.
u think btc would just crash straight down?

we weren't joking when we said its flipping with bch.
you'll see soon.
and they say linkies are deluded AHAHAHA
y-you'll seet.
increasingly nervous btrash extremist
who will win?BCH + Ver + chinaman ORa 300 second DDoS attack on bitthumb?

I hope those arkies aren't crazy, I entered for 20%
deluded bee-cashies
OP is a faggot.BCH was a roger ver pump n dump.
Hopefully Ver dumps the rest of his BTC soon so we can pick them up cheap.
He's welcome to bcash.
Sorry fren, I made some nice gains scalp trading this but there are billions of dollars worth of bagholders now
dump those bags plebs.
there is only one Bitcoin, and its name is BTC
Blockstream Coin is not the real Bitcoin.
The real Bitcoin doesn't have shit proprietary layers
I'm getting real tired of this shit cash boys, give it a rest
hilarious
boomers thought bitcoin was stupid>bcash supporters think bcore is stupid>therefore bcash supporters are boomersthere's so many leaps of logic there you might as well claim today's dash pump is Good For Bitcoin
yeah, real bitcoin (tm) has retarded eda and 50 blocks/h.fuck off, shill
Didn't I tell you?
This shit is so obvious.
This time it's not going back down unless Blockstream manages to DDoS all the major exchanges
Y-you'll see g-guys
Ver sold and you just got REKT
