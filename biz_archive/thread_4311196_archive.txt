WHEn is ASTRO being added to exchange?
Seriously why would you buy alts right now?
Lets say you have 250 bucks of bitcoin you bought at 7k, now that bitcoin is 5.5k it is worth 200 bucks and any alts u buy will be with 200 bucks not 250 so you not only get less as alts havent dropped in SATS only in dollar value because bitcoin has dropped.
what about ETH?
HST will be 2x by monday - 10x by end of dec 201
Or you could put fiat into ETH and use that to buy alts while they're low.
ASTRO looks interesting is there a discord i could join, all i can find is a twitter and facebook.
TKR been holding steading since this btc fork to flippening debacle started.
if you're not holding it don't hope to get rich any time soon.
BTC
are you stupid?
the bitcoin value meme is for retards who want to hold as many bitcoins as possible, you still make more roi in alts, at the end of the day you cash out in fiat.
yea i figure if i have more money USD when i sell than when i buy i made a profit.
EXNnow that is a true pajeet coin.
seriously https://etherdelta.com/#NIO-ETH
CARBONQTUM
shes already starting
CARBON12$ in volumevery nice
do the math you will have less money once u cash out in fiat because u bought less coins possible with less moeny
CFD and ASTRO only good ones so far anything else?half of these are not low marketcap.
EPY and HST.Both's market cap are still below $5MM.
Currently only trading on EtherDelta, but exchanges coming soon.Once this BCH shitfest is over, altcoins with small market cap like these will explode.

Seriously why would you buy alts right now?Lets say you have 250 bucks of bitcoin you bought at 7k, now that bitcoin is 5.5k it is worth 200 bucks and any alts u buy will be with 200 bucks not 250 so you not only get less as alts havent dropped in SATS only in dollar value because bitcoin has dropped.Example: You spend 250 on bitcoin at 7k+Now your bitcoin worth in dollars is 200~If you put in that bitcoin into an alt and it goes up 25% you made 50 bucks on your 200 and now you have gone evend uh
Rumor from where?
From what I remember exchanges were September though, which was only EtherDelta
In a week you might be able to get bitcoin at a 99% discount.hell take a flier at $50
