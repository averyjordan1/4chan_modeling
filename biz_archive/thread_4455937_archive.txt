A-am I gonna make it?
W-will I be done with this wage slave life by the end of next year if I keep putting $300-$400 in to each every two weeks while investing in various other coins when I can better afford to do so?
>not holding vertcoindo you hate money?
I'm so new to this I'm just now researching other coins.
ignore him hes just a shill, vert coin price is controlled by whales.yes thats a good start.
I started off last year puting a few hundred at a time into bitcoin.
I have doubts you'll be a millionaire, but you'll have more than enough money to make your life easy.
If I can keep working my comfy motorcycle dealership job while not having to stress about each paycheck because I have enough in coins I'll be happy
Cash out of power, it's gonna drop.
Depending on your preferences (long term, mid or short, with mid term being about a month) I'd put it into either LINK, REQ or OMG/BCH, respectively.
