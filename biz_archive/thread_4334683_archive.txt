MONEY>BTC>BCC>ALTS.
repeat of august.
It's our turn.
Who here comfy?
hope ur right.
sold my last btc for some salt
comfy aflook forward to seeing green
been iron hands for the past month ffs.
stupid btc bs
I only made a measly $200 since I got into trading BTC a few weeks ago, and that was from investing my entire $15k savings into BTC.
I coulda made a good $2000 or so instead if I sold during the $7.8k peak, but nooooo, I believed in the HODL meme.
Then I got woken up by a wet dream about fucking my mom on 7am in the morning when BTC started to crash.
I think God gave me that wet dream so i could wake up and sell my BTC without losses.
Holding MONEY now and couldn't'\ be comfier.
My Walton bleeds, just make it stop pls.
