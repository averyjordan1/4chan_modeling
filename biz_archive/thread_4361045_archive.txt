What you guys think about my portfolio?
It’s more like a long run protfolio.
long run protfolio>missing IOTA
You might not want to spread out so much for how much you have invested.
Move either XLM or LINK into ARK or REQ (Wait for a rise in the one you want to get rid of and a dip for the one you want to acquire)
Ummm add DGB for long term mate...
Wtf is this bullshit, OP?LMAO.You always go all in until you have at least $5k.Stop being a pussy and find a new altcoin and hope for the best.
Thank you for your advice!
Good point, but why shall I get rid of XLM?
Well it’s called poorfag diversity...
