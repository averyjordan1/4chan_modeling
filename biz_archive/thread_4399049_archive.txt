You know what he meant by this.
I'm not some Pajeet shill, go research BQX, it's more promising than ARK and Link combined (LINK is a bunk coin btw) ARK has some potential and I've got 200 in the chance it's going to make it, but BQX is under $1.50 and it won't be at this price for long.
It's hitting LTC prices by EOY 2018 get your bags stacking now before it's too late, follow the big money.
I'm only saying this because I'm actually one of the few who hopes we all Make our Lambo money in 2 years.
