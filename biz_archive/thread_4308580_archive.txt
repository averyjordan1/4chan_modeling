Also, I don't knew her name sorry.
Here's another qt though.
Was this always there or is it new?
>link's site goes downLinktards think it's an announcement
btc and eth options just redirect you to create.smartcontract.com, which were there before the updatehttps://web.archive.org/web/20171031033343/https://create.smartcontract.com/#/chooseHyperledger redirects to a mailto URL, so it just sets you up to send them an email.

4308601Why do people keep saying the site is down?was it actually down for a while?Could mean they're testing something..Fucking please i need this to get back to 30 cents
Yes it was down, I was on it and then it crashed.Its back now.
No updates from what I can see.You know if you're doubting LINK you really need to play around on their website man; most biztards havent actually checked out chainlink at all, and are just bought shills
