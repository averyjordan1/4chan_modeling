Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and what's the toher Bitcoin?I want to hold "bitcoin", can someone break down all the drama around the three/four please?
read /r/bitcoin faq and then read /r/btc faq.
Make up your own mind then.
Go 50% BTC, 25% ETH, 20% BCH, 5% LTC.
Bitcoin (BTC) is Bitcoin.
It's worth $8200.
It has 1mb blocks and segwit, which will allow important feature upgrades in the future.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a knockoff being pumped by chinese miners.
It's worth $1600.
It has 8mb blocks and no segwit, which gives it greater scale and lower transaction costs, but no segwit upgrades.Bitcoin Gold (BTG) is a knockoff being bought by people who really hate chinese miners.
It's worth $400.
It uses a mining algorithm that takes away chinese miner's competitive advantage.
So what you're saying is that BCH is better than BTC (at least for the near future) and they're both trash and he should buy Ethereum.
