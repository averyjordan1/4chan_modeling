This morning, we have seen Metaverse (ETP) announcing their listing on a chinese exchange that is very tough to get in.
Moments ago, they just announce their listing on another exchange!https://cex.com/Art/details/id/7.html
I call this my retirement card
stop the shills, it has never helped a coin, it only makes it seem less legit
I'm so sick of people posting on moon stuffs with no substance.
But if someone post something and provides a source/link, I will read into it and wouldn't look at it as shilling.
We all know about potential of mvs.
Just stop shilling on biz.
They ruin everything.
You can't stop the excitement of the raving fans of Metaverse.
You have not seen the full force of shilling for Metaverse.
It's coming in a few days time.
Get ready
metaverse is a piece of shit.stop shilling this fucking scam.
fuck off back to your day job.
nice just bought 100k
it's a scam.
does /biz ever learn?
