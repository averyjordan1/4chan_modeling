Hello /biz/, today was my first time trading (I did make profit and will go into it how) and I have few questions.Right now I'm looking to daytrade and am wondering if the biggest volume is always in the morning (European time).
If I'm correct, crypto markets all active 24h, while NASDAQ has its opening and closing hours defined?Given todays POWR rise, there was a lot of volume and momentum, which enabled me to spot ABCD pattern and make 12% profit out of it.
Given the fact POWR seems like a long-term hold and will rise, would it be smart to buy it tommorow pre-market hours and hopefully ride the first bullish momentum climb?
I've missed it today, but jumped in when it formed ABCD..However, I've plans for tomorrow to observe what is going to happen and maybe hope it happens the same as today.Is my thinking good?
Please, feel free to critique what I'm saying, trying to learn through my process.
