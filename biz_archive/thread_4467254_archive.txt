That feeling when the btc bull run seems a little off.
Will Tether Crawling in my skin BTC soon?
I really hope not.
BTC is JUSTing alts but if it crashes it will double down on it.As nice as it is to think of BTC crashing and getting revenge for tanking half of my portfolio I like still being up on the whole.
A BTC crash destroys everything.
i think it's just a full on fomo bullrun mostly fueled due to CME, i expect it to reach like $9500, then dip massively, $10k is a huge psychological barrier.
It is about time to sell everything.
End of month crash incoming in a few days.
We will see a 20%-35% decrease overall before reaching currents levels again EOY.
