Always do the opposite of what you think you should do
That's not bad at all.
Will you complete the /biz/fecta and sell below $7k?

4450631Holy shit.
You should be afraid when normies come in and say "BTC is just printing money"oh fuck
This is one reason why I think BCH will win in the end.
BTC's only value proposition is "BTC will rise and normies buy BTC" while BCH is both used as a store of value AND a currency, bitcoin's original whitepaper intent
buy high, sell lowyou are gonna do just fine here
Good job anon.
Now wait for the dip to 5k and sell it all
whatever

LOLSo impressive you said it with a straight face!
Nice, it's going to 10k by the end of the month
BTC's value proposition is not determined by a random biz post you retart.Big blocks are not an effective scaling solution if the network is to remain decentralized and thus secure.2nd layer solutions will make BTC MORE useful for small transactions.
trips confirm
wise choiseBitcoin will hit 10 000 $ soon
