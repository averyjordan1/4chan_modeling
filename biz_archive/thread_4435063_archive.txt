4435573STRAP IN LADSBRING ME BACK TO THE BLACK
This was my first buy and I bought at such a terrible time, hopefully we get lucky
its mooning again, either get those iron fists or sell on this Moon, your choice.
Once it breaks $50 it won't drop below $48 again until Monday.
Then it's a matter of the news, if it's the real deal, 3 Lifetimes worth of Blessings as the Council Member said, you will see it go to 100+ in minutes.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36sIRRdFSU
If you sell now, you are a brainlet.
Give yourself permission to be rich.
It won't be long now.
BUY HIGH SELL LOW, THE /BIZ/ WAY
WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T IT KEEP GOING UP
its already going down
No
IS NEO CURRENTLY LOW OR HIGH?
This is not a pnd look st the graph.Still not sure why it dropped that fast, idk what that was.
Check the graph.
This is how we do it.
Oh yeah.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36sIRRdFSU
coordinated steal your Neo timegotta have hands of fuckin steel
yeah and still cant figure it out.. depends on the timeframe... so HIGH or LOW?
Buy or Sell
it's just weak hands looking to cash out at 40%+ gains from 3.5 then more weak hands jump on board to get 20% gains, then they buy back in at 30% losses.... it literally only dropped $5, now it's $3 away from where it was earlier today
We aren't in this for +/- 20%.
We are in for +2000%.
Wait until Tuesday.
Dude I bought at 46.
My hands were shaking
4435826I learned how to have steady hands from this game when I was 4.
I'm not fucking selling.
See you on the moon boys.
I look at it like this, if the news sucks and I lose it'll drop down to $35 and I'll break even, depending on how quick I can get out, if the news is good it will shoot up to $100+ over an hour and keep climbing for the next week until it corrects to $200+ NEO is a $300 coin that's been waiting to break back out, it's ATH is something like $90, so even if the news is not as good as anticipated but it's still good, we might see $80+
>neo has constant good news and conferences for months>nothing gets pre-announced>suddenly tweet saying essentially "We have news, this is a big deal"If you guys aren't at least 50% portfolio in Neo wise the fuck up
operation was my shit you must be a late 80's babyWE'RE NOT FUCKING SELLING
its ATH is $90Dude its around $50
Actually you can't lose.
The worst case scenario you are stuck holding onto a good crypto for a while.
I won't sell if it does drop to $35 because it's going to go up to $100 sometime in the next few months even with no announcement.
This
4435875Hold it until Sunday Night, I'm anticipating it to be high $50's by that time.
You can sell and if it's good news buy back in quick - you will lose a few coins but you'll still be a winner at the end of the day.
*inhales heavily*YYESS, RISE FOR DADDYY... OH N-NOI GOT--A-ANNNTTSSS INN MY PANTSSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
I have 100% of my crypto portfolio in right now.
WHY THE FUCK AM I ALWAYS FUCKING WRONGI TRY TO LOOK AT THE ORDER BOOK TO MAKE MY DECISIONS AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WOULD DUMP HARD, BUT THEN IT STARTS GOIN UP AGAINI GUESS IF I BUY BACK IT'LL DROP, SO I'M NOT FUCKING BUYING!
You're right, sorry shitty blockfolio is glitching out I've got 42 Coins in Exchange and 100 in NeonWallet (Ledger) the 42 are profit at this point so I'm selling them for ETH sunday night regardless.
If it's good news I'll jump back on at a small loss.
% here.
Can't get rid of my eth and a few other projects that have potential
Good luck in no NEOer.
I'll look down on you from the moon if I'm feeling generous.
Same.
Need to get unrekted from the bch rape last week.
I moved 70% of my ETH into NEO at 3.5 last night and have watched ETH climb up since, it's heart breaking to see my favorite coin take off without me.
looking at the order book?
never make any move based off a fucking order book man.
BUY LOW SELL HIGH OR HOLD
That's fine.
My real portfolio is only ~10% of crypto to begin with.
I won't risk more than 15% on something that has a small possibility of going completely tits up at some point.
This is just an investment to pad my pockets a little bit and have some fun watching people lose to me.If I was poor though I would put 100% of my savings into it.
If I lost it all, I'd still be poor, but if things worked out, I'd be rich.
not knowing there is another announcement on Tuesday.Nice try Pajeet
I'm Japanese you Amerifat...
I fucking hate curry
whenever a TOP 10 coin is challengedthe big financial companies behind it (or countries ) will try to make sure that people don't bag drop in favor of a competitor.
Think Core vs BCH .
Neither of those were reallyaverage retail consumers at war.
ETH fucking went UP the second Vitalik madepedo comments.
PS : You realize that half this board is FUDDINGpeople to get them to drop bags before the announcement?
Why Sunday night?
The big drop tends to occur either during the conference or immediately after it ends, not 18 hours+ beforehand.
All you faggots who think Chang is going to give you money THAT easily... Suckers.Remember, this is the wild west and it's still a Chong eat dog world.
SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO THE LINKIESNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I've lost hundreds of dollars already on NEO buying high and selling low.make this stop
MUST ACCUMULATEbut spent all money on Loopring and AdEx
Sunday night in China is what Monday morning in America?
Sorry I keep forgetting
literally google
america saturday is slow day.america sunday night is busy, is asian monday morning
You Ameriturds are so stupid.
it's Sunday morning here is all I know, I keep thinking this announcement is Sunday night for America.
Here you Go Biz Bros this is it can I give you anymore reason to HOLD!https://bittox.com/2017/11/17/china-unban-icos-making-way-neo/
I don't get it.
I've been trading GAS solely based on RSI and Bollinger Bands and I've been doing well.
If you even want to use Elliott wave theory you can consider this the D retracement for a final push.
How is it so hard for you guys?
There's literally no real thinking to be done in crypto.
minutes and I still haven't received the coins I bought back at the dip on binanceCome on you fucking chinks give me that recovery
Now it's even more funny to think about that guy who bought ($30k) link at ATH, sold it at ATL to buy NEO at ATH, and now it's going down....If you're reading this I hope you don't neck yourself, but learn your lesson.
YOU CANT MINE NEO, ITS UNMINEABLE FAGGOT THATS ALL FAKE YOU GUYS GOT CHINKKKKEDDDD!!!!!
MY MONEY MY MONEY ITS ALL GONE
did you even read the article?
It says nothing about Mining NEO it says they are going to ban mining BTC
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
fucking hate curryThen you aren't Japanese.
Nice try.
neo is priced in btc you dumbass
This is the final dip before the big FOMO tomorrow.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUFWXpYJKaI
I started with 5k dollars a few months agoThis is what happened yesterdaySince 11/17/2017689.06 (start)738.16 (+49.10)707.85 (-30.31)667.12 (-40.73)618.50 (-48.62)589.16 (-29.34)553.46 (-35.70)510.03 (-43.43)559.60 (+49.57)497.80 (-61.80)463.31 (-34.49)Now I'm losing 50 dollars on Neo as I type this.I once had 2000 OmisegoI also had Neo when it i was Ant SharesGot in this "game" on July...Put my life savings on itConsidering suicide non-stopI'm 22, college dropout, never had a gf and too stupid to trade crypto
Is this bait?
QUIT IT QUIT IT QUIT IT QUIT IT QUIT IT STOP IT QUIT IT STOP IT STOP IT STOP IT MAKE IT STOPPPPP MAKE IT STOP GOING DOWN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO UPPPBIZ TOLD ME IT WAS GONNA GO UP IT HAS TO GO UP BIZ TOLD ME SO MY MOM IS GONNA BE SO PISSED I USED HER BITCOINS TO BUY THIS SHES GONNA FUCKING KILL MEI BOUGHT BITCOINS FOR HER AT 7100 SHE WOULD BE UP RIGHT NOW IF I HAD STAYED IN BITCOIN BUT I WANTED TO TRADE ALTS I ALREADY LOST A GOOD CHUNK OF THE MONEY SHE GAVE ME TO BUY BITCOINTHIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE BLACK.
IF I HAD STAYED IN BITCOIN I WOULD BE UP OVER $3000
Hold it until tomorrow night, it'll jump back up.
China just woke up and will Pump this up overnight you'll wake up to at least $48 - $55, if you have weak hands cash out there.
It's honestly a gamble after that, it maybe $100+ if you hold for 2 months, it maybe 1 week, but if you can have the patience I promise you'll make it Biz bro, don't give up, we want you to succeed.
Hmmm, isnt NEO currently on a down trend?
I got in on the dip at 526, but is there any reason to believe this will go up crazy again?
>tfw bought 20 NEO when they where $17 a pop>Bought 1 BTC around the same time for ~$3500>Tfw pretty much doubled my savings since SeptemberWho else here /comfy/
There's a lot of crab bucket mentality in the numbers right now.
So many people are trying to cut their losses so the moment it goes up they sell.
I'm deciding on an order at 0.005 at this point since its too volatile to buy back in now
we ar estill comfortably over $40?
Did you buy at $45+ or something?
We were telling you all day yesterday at $32+ to buy it.... just fucking HOLD it, imagine all those ETH guys who dumped out at $50 only to come back a few days later and see it at $100+Look at the ETH graph there's no Overnight 100x (Even BCC went from $600 to $2400 over 2 days and then back to $1200 in 10 minutes)
Why the fuck would people fomo on a crashing price, they have fear of missing out on losing all their money and bagholding?
True biz style.
You shouldn’t be making more than 3 trades a week, to ensure that you only take the best trades.
And you shouldn’t put all 5K in every trade, shouldve done 1,600-1,700 per trade.
nice
I got more and more desperate the more I lost.
At first I thought about just buying a few coins and holding for a very long time...
It's crazy how EASY it is to lose in this shit.
I'm too emotional at this point and will only stop when I lose every last dollar.
fucking same, fuck
Can I give some advice - leave your Money in NEO Put the rest into ETH and maybe BQX or ARK if you want to gamble on a company that has the possibility to Moon, set alarms for your sell point with Blockfolio or put sell orders in advance.
You won't lose this way.
If your coin drops just hold it, they eventually rebound.
oh and never Buy LINK or anyother ICO biz is shilling unless you research it and they have a good group of Devs, working product (Or high potential), Low Supply (Under 200mill), and have no failed ICO founders on their team, also talk to the company on twitter or reddit if their customer service is good thats a good sign.
ARK is one of the few coins biz shills I think may possibly have a chance, but I still haven't put a dime into ARK
fuck bro i hope you're right, i put 5k into neo @ 43$.
if i make it i'll send you some btc
Remember that people put thousands of dollars into this in august when it hit 48
profit taking + bagholders breaking even who bought in at $50 last time.It's an emotional level.Hopefully news turns out to be good and it launches past $50
"Don't be scared guys, they're totally going to announce that NEO now has a monopoly on chinese ICOs"You're all deluded and you got memed on.
Whatever pump and dump group originally spread the rumor that this was what was going to be said at that conference bought first, spread the rumor, then dumped on all you gullible greedy soon to be pink wojaks.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k36sIRRdFSU
I should also note, notice how there's almost no activity on NEO on asian exchanges.
News like this would for sure spread for insider trading in China.
If it didn't, it means the news don't exist.
Bought at 450k SATs>Comfy as fuck
When do they actually present at the conference?
Please tell me in burger time, not chink time.
Here's my BTC - NEO will be $50+ when you wake up tomorrowIf you don't send it no worries, but just HOLD it we will both make it.
I'm banking on NEO too, I want this as bad as you.14XD2ByuiGRg9NpJFcfU99ZgftHL5KiX6N

I've made 10 trades this past week and have an extra 7k to show for it.more than 5 trades is fine, but you also have to accept there are weeks on weeks where trading just isnt a solid plan and you should hold and wait.
is this the dip?
which exchanges?
nice
Volume growing, moon mission imminent
k here.
Took profit at the top of the top.
hodl fucking add nigger
