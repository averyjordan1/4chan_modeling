Ath chasers about to get shaken out of BCH, get ready to sell and rebuy!
y-you too
Sell at 0.019 you say?

It hit 0.18 and dropped to mid 0.17 for like 2 hours before.
He's a boy
sauce
I hope we get a dip back to 1200 to shake out moonkids so I can go in with a bigger position
Big sell wall at 1,700,000KRWWatch the market on Bithumb, that's where the trade volume is happening.
700k on Bithumb vs 50k volume on Bitfinex.Watch for Bithumb to go down, if that happens price will drop for sure.
And Bithumb has already gone down TWICE killing of BCH pumps, one at the big pump, and one earlier during this pump.
even betteruse the arrow on the post, image search, then iqdb, you idiot.
Think we have hit it?
noope, shit looks like we are going to hit 1,750,000
Buy in goal will be 0.160, small upwards correction right now and than all the way down again
