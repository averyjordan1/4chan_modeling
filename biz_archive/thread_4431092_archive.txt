only pumpers and bagholders bought above $668
Wasn't BCH around .16BTC during that time?If he bought BTC, he would have the same gains + BTG airdrop.
I remember when he posted that, lost any respect for him after it.
It's not like he needed the money, why take the risk of selling?
Then why post about it publicly to all your followers, especially why mention the price?
Absolute brainlet tier, and now I see all his other BTC shilling as utter retardism as well.
RIP George, you dumb mother fucker.
