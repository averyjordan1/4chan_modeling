WHY THE FUCK IS BTG TRADING FOR OVER $800 ON BINANCE???
TELL MEEEEE
pnd dont do it son, lost money yesterday
before that, tell me when bittrex is going to give me my btg reeeeee
huge arbitrage opportunity
all these forks will kill bitcoin core very soon
cause everybody's having a temper tantrum about segwit2x not happening
already tried, wallets locked lol
This fucking bittrex.
Locked my btc just so they dont give me my btc gold reeeeeee
AHHHH GUYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I'VE BEEN HOLDING SINCE THE FORK, SHOULD I SELL????
It's a closed system where no one can dump, deposits and withdrawals aren't active yet and Binance is the only exchange the gave the "coins" ahead of time.
