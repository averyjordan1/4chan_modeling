>devs fuck up some legal stuff>readily admit it immediately on twitter>are honest and say they may have some trouble with this but are doing what they can >still up 2x+ from ICO price >can buy the dip now for easy 10x+ gains when they resolve the legal issues SAY IT WITH ME: COMFYDO
devs fuck up some legal stuffmaybe they realized they couldn't scam retards and use their real names
Congrats on this.
Seriously.
This really cracks me up, I feel bad for those who left high orders on EtherDelta
I wondered why my confido was down 85% topkek
Didn't an anon on /biz/ larped a ICO worth over $10 million was a complete scam?
it this the coin that was the scam?
Bingo.
I see some buy orders in ed, will they put that intentionally or they did not know this news?
What if... it isn't actually that bad, the "legal stuff" they have to resolve, I mean, I'm unironically considering buying some for cheap right now
Another one bites the Joost
lol.
u are truly retard.
u have many legit projects under radar.
go and put it on them
The state of /biz/I don't really care, but I'm at the very least thankful to the anons that bought my bags.
Kek
Considering the wording of the announcement I think this might be a great shout.
Just risky as fuck.
Then why did Confido team dump everything before the announcement?
