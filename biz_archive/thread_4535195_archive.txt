So what are people up to for the coming price flux?
Personally I'm looking back to the S2x shit and remembering the meteoric rises of the two Litecoin 2.0's, namely GRS and VTC.
I've gone into VTC because it's got more hype, but I'm concerned that GRS has the better tech, and higher to rise.
What do you think biz?
Grostl is, by far, better tech than Vert.
Problem is, the market only buys the biggest shilled coin.
Combine that with Vert halfing in December and Vert is probably better short term.Grostl will have its day.
It is seriously undervalued at these prices.
To add to this, look at shitcoin gold, rocketing up.
That to me would suggest the BTC-tied coins will rocket once again, just like the last spell of FUD.
Both VTC and GRS are great buys at these prices to be honest.
Bitcoin = Good nameLitecoin = Okay nameVertcoin = Shit nameGroestlcoin = Hahahahha
The name of this coin sounds like a tranny gargling on a chode.
It really is a terrible name.
A rebrand to something snappy could literally 5x this shit.
This, call me when they rebrand.
They should just call it Bitcoin Groestl and guarantee us the moon
Google coin.
