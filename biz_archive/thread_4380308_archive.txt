Ask me anything.Obviously you are LARPing, but just in case you're not... you should create a documentary of your experience.
Vice would probably film it.You need a second cameraman - ideally a local - because you are going to get robbed and murdered for your BTC.While I am sad for your family's future loss, the documentary will be entertaining so please proceed with your plan.

Just how do you expect to be slaughtered?
Ten to one it's a torture thing
