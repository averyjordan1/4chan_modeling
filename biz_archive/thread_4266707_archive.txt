what do you guys think about Ripple?
I am currently holding 500 ODN but I am thinking about buying 600 dollars worth of Ripple (Or another coin if you have suggestions)
1. why do you still have odn?2.
ripple is a shitcoin3.
buy vert
What the fuck.
Why are people still doing this?
XRP will forever be $0.20.
Even when PBC pnd'ed this shitcoin it went up 2 cents and then cratered.
All other alts are up 30% and cripple is up 3%.
God damnit.
What the fuck.
In conclusion, buy more odn, buy Coss, and kys.
XRPODN is releasing their app soon and is pretty low right now.
I have about a thousand ripple.
I donâ€™t see it going down I mean it has a high market cap.
