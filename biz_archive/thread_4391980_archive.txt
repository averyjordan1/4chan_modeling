From their website:Bitbay is a working real-world cryptocurrency powering a fully-functionaldecentralized marketplacethat allows you to buy and sell goods and services easily, securely, and anonymously.
The protocol also has a revolutionarydynamic rolling pegthat controls liquidity and allows for price stability and growth.
Most importantly, the marketplace uses adouble-deposit escrowsystem, meaning that no one can profit from dishonest behaviors â€“ all contracts must be fulfilled as written.
This means no unjust arbiters or middle men.
Use the platform tosend payments to friends via email, barter, trade cash for coins, form joint accounts, vote and much more.
The software is also completely FREE to use.There's some stuff on the roadmap that is happening soon
BitBay is shit lol.
Syscoin is the one that will actually moon.
BITBAY>developer holds over 100 million bitbays in his personal wallet, which is 10% of the supply>outdated wallet>marketplace looks like its from the early 90's>marketplace constantly crashes, is buggy, god awful UI and its resource hoarding as all hell>you are not allowed to sell child pornography, guns, illegal drugs or fake money on the marketplace, which would be the only reason to actually use a decentralized marketplace>developer will most likely cash out and disappear once he can sell his coins at 0.10$literally a pyramid coin, no thanks
