/biz/I've been in and out of Crypto since 2015 so not a n00b...Am i being retarded in thinking, when people are like 'shit son i got in at 32k sats' it makes no diff what you sell them for as long as the ALTUSD value is up?Like I bought some VTC about 10 days ago at $4, was about 75k sats...Now the price (at time of posting), hit 74k sats but was 74k sats was $5... Plz forgive me if I'm being stupid, but surely the sats value means jack shit, as long as you're making profit right???
Too many are like 'shit i bought in at 93k sats, I better HODL to get my $$ back' but essentially if BTC price raises the same $$ value now might only be 70k sats?Retard or real talk?/x
The price of BTC has increased, therefore you are making a loss, compared to if you had just held BTC and not invested in the alt.
