literally mooning all time high next weekmark my words
I'm a holder.
I WANNA BELIEVE.
Agree it will moon and we will definitely see an ATH in USD terms.
The daily chart for ETHBTC is very bullish too.>BB Buy>MACD buy>RSI buyIm unsure if the trend can be classified as a descending wedge tho
The increasing volume as confirmation, BTC is also expected to stagnate, or have one last bull run before consolidation.
ATH TIME.
I want eth to moon as much as vitalik, but come on, gives us better discourse.When it jumps, are we looking at .1 btc levels, and will btc fall at the same time?
Are we looking at new USD ATHs?I'm for one surprised money flowed back into the alts, but not into Eth at the same rate.Is this because of the simultaneous parity scare?Where did it come from, because btc didn't dip that much.
Was it all tied up in tether?What other factors are at play?
Buy up to 575
vitalik can literally hold a party balloon and he will float to the moon.
People are buying up alts with their ETH rather than holding ETH itself because of FOMO in regards to recent rises across the boards.
I'm holding my ETH because there's easier return in holding a bunch than shaving gains off pajeet coins.
When I make enough from that I'll buy the dip in alts, which is always bound to happen.
Won't moon yet, but will by the end of the year.
