BCH holding itself at ~0.23.
What will happen when the chinks wake up ?
Volume is still thereI think we are in for a secound massive pump
nope
Yup.
The fundamentals of Bitcoin were broken when the 2x fork failed.
There's no plan to relieve the fee congestion or allow Bitcoin to grow.
bitcoin layer 2 networks are 90 percent complete and whoever is spamming the network with transactions will run out of funds eventually.
on january 1st when the biggest exchange with the most liquid market (coinbase) gives access to their american clients who hate chinkcoin cash, there will be a blood bath like never seen before.
also, when the difficulty readjusts bitcoin will be about 2.5x more profitable to mine.
aslong as there not stupid enough to leave all there shit on that one exchange to get ddosed again we should see yet another nice little run in around 5-8 hours
Too much volume will result in flatlines, we're not going to see the same momentum we saw.
It's over.
What about the bch fork?
Whens that happening?
What will happen when the chinks wake up ?What happens when difficulty adjusts in a few hours?
What happens
"90% complete"- according to Blockstream, yeah right.centralized- get ready for banks to control your transactions and subscription feesno timetable for releaseCore tactic #4:Distract from fundamental inadequacies in 1 MB blocks.
Claim backlogs are entirely the work of malicious actors pushing "spam".Do not entertain the notion that there's something fundamentally wrong with a system that can be brought to its knees by a malicious attacker in the first place!
Miners move back to BTC (unless they can pull a huge push back up in price for BCH) and the market will likely follow themCalling out Core for centralization>Jihan is literally going to try and change the difficulty on BCH to keep miners from moving
