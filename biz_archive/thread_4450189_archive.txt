Anybody else get on today to find a massive dump has started?I thought it might be short term but look at this order book.Massive amounts of consistently lower sells keep popping up while NOBODY is buying...Is this the exit?
Should I get out now?What did I miss?
Don't care, not selling, will die with these 100 neos.
But whats happening?If something happened I would rather buy back in after the dump is over.
bought at 630k, sold at 470kdid i do good /biz/
4446830Jesus.
I saw todaymaybe twenty 8.00 Neo buys in a row.
The order book was nothing but 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,Something fishy.
Thank God I sold at 46$ because i knew that there is going to be a pre-news dump
Check the other NEO threads, the news is not going to be as big as expected so the dump.
Everyone of you pajeets laughed at me.
This shit was so obvious.
Get fcking burned.>MUH ETH flippening.
