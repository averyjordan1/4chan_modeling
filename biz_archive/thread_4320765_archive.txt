Does anyone know if the SALT lending platform will only support BTC as collateral?
Or will it also support other Crypto currency's such as ETH and BCH?
Hi friend,It will support ETH as well.
Other alts will be added down the line
Seems like it's slightly too early to buy this.
Ride the BCC/BTC waves to profit for a day or two more
Thank you anon.
DASH, XEM, LTC, BTC and ETH
don't listen to these senilecoin idiots, current price is the cheapest it will get, we are close to the platform opening date and people will Fomo even more.
