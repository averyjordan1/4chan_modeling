We're not betting on just probability here.
We're betting on psychology of the market.
Closer to poker than roulette but still different.
pic related is what op invested into apparently...so its like going all in on 2 kings or something at the start and then suddenly all 2s and 3s show up and the guy next to u had a 2 and a 3?

And you're comparing the company to other companies in the same industry and seeing which one has more potential in the future.
It requires research.
It's "kind of" gambling but more like making educated guesses.
Also, it's worth it to mention that you're not just randomly placing bets, but you're doing research on companies and buying shares of a company.
As a shareholder, you may have voting rights, invitations to conferences, and if you own enough shares, you could even attempt a hostile takeover.
Also, on some stocks, you receive dividends.
