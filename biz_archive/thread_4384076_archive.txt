I've just bought Link (9k).

But I also think I am going to be rich next year now, amirite?

Today is the day you'll look back on as the day your life path shifted towards becoming wealthy.
Congratulations on this, Anon.
Really.
i have bought so many memecoins shilled on /biz, including link.
50% do well, 50% shit the bed.in baseball terms thats a .500 batting average which is damn good.
Thinking about trying alts and going in on this too - what wallet you guys use to store it?!
In terms of rugby penalty kicking, that's pretty a pretty terrible average.
I just put it on EtherDelta and forget that it exists.
You should probably use MEW though
