I mean how much can one expect from reddit
on the bright side, it is like a gravity well for idiocy that largely quarantines it from where it can do any harm, and punishes the creators of it by subjecting them to the infectious human waste which they have cultivated.
so is r/btc, faggotredditors not welcome
What would you define as redpilled
this is fucking hilarious.
truth about jews and the holocaust>the marxist subversion in schools>the female mind>the bell curve
r/bitcoin is CENTRALIZED AS FUCKIf you even mention the letters "BCH" instabanned!So much for "Decentralized Bitcoin", also if you want to contribute to BTC, you can't even do that because Blockstream Core IS CONTROLLING EVERYTHING!They don't want Miners who spent millions of dollars mining to have any voting power.
They don't want any other development teams having any development power.BCH is where it is at.
The miners profit by mining BCH, the developers can develop and if the miners like the idea then they can implement it.The users can also vote and downcast ideas or approve them.IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
