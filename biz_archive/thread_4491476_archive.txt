GIven that ETH seems to be valued at ~$300 by the market, provided it's not influenced too much by a new mt.
gox'ing (I know that's a big fucking if), shouldn't it moon in sat value the more BTC declines to maintain it's market price?
fuck off nsa
No, because it's also been exposed to the tether pump too since it's traded on bitfinex.
The only real safe haven is fiat on GDAX.
They're FDIC insured up to $250k, so even in the absolute worst case scenario where every exchange folds, you still get your money back.
i would rather go with monero or litecoin
