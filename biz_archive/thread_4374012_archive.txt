im up 511% thanks to me investing in BCH 20 days ago.Why havent you jumped on the BCH train anon?
i dont want your bags faggot fuck off
ever heard of a bulltrap bagholder?
Should've cashed out at 0.41
Redpillme on the bull trap meme
too much pain from the dump therefore next bullish sign will dump further on the ABC correction.Don't be stupid, as soon as these bagholders feel like their bags aren't quite as heavy anymore they will dump.
hes just a core cuck shillinghe knows btc days are numbered
using chart analysis on crypto.You can be right more times by flipping a coin.
Retarded BCH holder detected.
but they fucking aren't though.. shit going up as we speak
Don't you mean cored outyeawwwwSeriously though it's not over.
BCH is likely to win in the end.
Unless BTC survives until January 1st.
bch has no hope unless koreans do the massive pumping again which they wont cuz they got fucked hard the last time.
the fact that bch has to index itself in value against btc is reason enough to classify it as a shitcoin.
INTO THE TRASH IT GOES
DIE BCH
BCH is winning and there is nothing you can do about it :^)
I don't understand why people are so obsessed about it surpassing bitcoin or not.
Personally I've been riding the waves even on the decline on BCH and been making easy profit on the decline.
If you know what you are doing you can easily make money whether it goes down or not.
Volume has gone down a lot but it is still considerably high compared to other coins making it easy to day trade.
>Why havent you jumped on the BCH train anon?because it's fucking up 500% in 20 days dumb fuckit's a pump and dumb.
you suppose to get in early and dump on top
