Where's the money flowing today?BTC is back a bit below $8k, BCH isn't mooning, alts are pretty much all down, BTCG went up earlier but it's not parabolic (and only ~$200m volume).
Where the fucks the money being moved to today?
Into fiat (not USDT)

Sold it all on Gemini, thank god they actually use USD.
