ITT: PredictionsBitcoin will be below $1000 3 years from now.
Screencap this post.
I will return on 11/14/2020 to gloat about how right I am.
why
LINK will be $20 and REQ will be $15 this time next year
good luck with that at the very least bitcoin would take a role similar to gold in that people might not use it for anything but it will be a safe way to store value.
So we can all look back later and laugh at how wrong/right we were.
*sniff* *sniff*Is that a corecuck I smell?
