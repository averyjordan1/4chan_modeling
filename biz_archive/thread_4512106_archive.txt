This thing is shitting me right?By now it looks like it might be just a little pump & dump action with another bleed out scenario followed after.I will only buy again if xx or lower -that's most likely the scenario anyway...
you're a retard for waiting that long to sell but yeah this pump if anything will just force the price to dump down further in the short term
Only in the darkest hourWhen youâ€™ve lost all hopeWhen it looks like LINK is dead foreverThat is when it will moon.When you sell.
