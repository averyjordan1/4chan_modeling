So at what point will people get sick of all this drama and just go into LTC?
It's objectively better superior to both core and cash.Yeah I know brand name has a lot to do with it but surely LTC is due a pump?
LTC is worthless an just a clone of BTC.it will be obsolete eventually.
its literally a test dummy for the real thing, BTC
ltc is better than btc by mere virtue of not having the btc devs as their devs.
Savagely true
I've quit anything Bitcoin and moved to : ETH LTC XMR as my biggest portion.
