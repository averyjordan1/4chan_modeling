Anyone else suffering from the alt coin bleed?
This is worse than the previous one
no, kys
Buy bch
How the fuck is this worse?
its like 10% on a few alts that will bounce right back in an hour when the bch fomo shit dies off.The last bleed literally took 90% off of link
once the bad drivers dump BCH (45k volume) we will see yet another alt pump, until BTC starts being schizo again.
This.Just hodl man.

About to dump half of my bch today if the price doesnt keep rising.
