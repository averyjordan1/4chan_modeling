Dude, that's 2250% returns.
Congrats.How long have you been at it?
That'll last your one year when you go outside OP
dude thats exactly the right way.
how much time did you invest to make these 45 $?
Started in February with buying ETH and BTC, $50-$100bux at a time because absolutely poor.
Stopped putting money in somewhere around september because I need it for other things now.Not that much, I read the research stuff anyway because I'm interested in the implications.
Only hold, no trading whatsoever.
