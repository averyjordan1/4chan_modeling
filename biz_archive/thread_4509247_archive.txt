Leave Sergey alone.
I've never seen a more abused and bullied man in the crypto space.
He doesn't owe you anything, and he may have low testosterone due to his weight.
That is not his fault, even if it leads to low libido, motivation, and drive.
I want each and every one of you to apologize and promise to be nice to him.
Sergey is alternating between eating Big Macs and snorting cocaine off of black BBW booty cheeks while Rory is furiously stroking his pencil dick in the corner.
That’s why all his “updates” trying to hide the fact that this project is a complete debacle are riddled with typos.
Steve is the only one trying.
He’s locked away in his moms basement trying to learn GO.
It’s such an obscure and asinine language that he can’t find the documentation he needs.
He’s about to snap.
He keep frantically calling Sergey.
Sergey only texts back, “new phone, who dis” and “32 million solves my oracle problem.” Get out
Reminder that Sergey lurks biz
I'm not apologizing till he can get the fucking token above $.50.
No, Sergey should apologize.
That motherfucker.
I'm sorry sergij, I promise I'll be nice to you in the future.
If you somehow manage to navigate the price down to 1 cent so I can fill a swimming pool with the deluded one's tears I'll buy a Big Mac.
kek
I bet he's waiting until we sell en masse before releasing news too
Genuinely lmaod
