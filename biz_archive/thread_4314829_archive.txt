Guys, yesterday (8 hours ago) i send my btc to bittrex for $10 (350 sat/b) , today, the transaction is still stuck and it looks like 350 sat/b transaction aren't getting mined anytime soon.Now i wake up to btc at fucking $5900and bch at $2300, i actually feel nauseous.
I can't even sell my btc since the chain is dead atm.
it is ok, one day soon god wil do something to correct the evil in world
My whole life savings (once ~$3300, soon a lot less) are stuck in there.
I'm a schizo neet and it took me a long time to get that money.
there is a lot of evil at work with these price change in past few days... can only wait for the calm
told you to buy bch before its too late, you were warned

Just spread it across a bunch if you're paranoid.
We've had like 10 highly profitable, unexpected events this year and in every one of them to-exchange transactions got stuck on the way.>eth moon>neo moon>bch fork>btg fork>s2x cancellationand now>The Second Great Chink Siege
Dont buy it retards.

just suck it up and go get a minimum wage job, you can earn $3k in a few months if you don't buy stupid weeb shit and nintendo games and just save your money

What wallet do you have?
If you have a wallet.dat file there are a few open source tools out there that allow you to delete unconfirmed transactions and resend them with a higher fee.
I accidentally sent some BTC a few months ago without a fee and it was stuck for weeks until I modified my wallet.dat and resent it.
Was a bit of a learning curve b/c I had to learn a few basics of Python.
I sent it with a trezor wallet, so the fee is final.
Seems like it was a p&d anyways so i'm not worried anymore.
