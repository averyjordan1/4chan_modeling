Can someone explain how this is any different from buying antshares sub dollar.
I know you fucks don't give a shit about the partnerships and applications of the technology, you're just in it for the money.
Shit like this going up 240% is so looney makes me not want to tell anybody I invest in crypto, really devalues the entire market imo.
This thing even gives you more gas than neo 1:1 "petrol" ratio.
Fuck its fucking tempting not getting some myself but I know better than to get dumped on by fucking pajeets and their street shitter friends.
it's a pnd
Thanks anon!
Going lunar.

Isn't this the same as antshares just 'rebranded'and isn't antshares the same one that makes you give root certificate for the fucking wallet client//node?The one that is a chinese 'blockchain' with (alleged/potential) connections to (Chinese) government?
faggot
I know but this is pnd random so it doesn't really matter.
What's the target?
