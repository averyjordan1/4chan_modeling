Card and App get released in Dezember.
I think we see a pump to $1.50, so we can sell our bags.
This is the best crypto card out there though, considering that you actually own your money.
.50$ ?
I think rather something around 10$.
They have a Professional PR Company that secured placement in international Mainstream Media for them.
Kraken and Bitfinex are also coming.10$ = 230 Million MarketcapMCO was at 230 Million Marketcap and TenX at 550 Million, no reason TokenCard cannot achive the same, especially as they are superior to any other card as you can keep your wallet/private keys.Also they are the first Card to spend ETH with.
thiswe're looking at a billion dollar mcap in 2019
I would like TokenCard to achive the same Marketcap but do you think this is realistic?
Ok TenX was at 550 Million, and TokenCard is a Whitelabel DebitCard but do you rly think this could happen?
