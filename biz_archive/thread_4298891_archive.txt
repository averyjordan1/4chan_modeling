>tfw you bought bitcoin in at the all time high and now its literally dropped by 1k
Congrats on becoming an investor, I guess.
You can buy bitcoin for 1k now.Do it before its too late, bitcoin cash wont stay 1k for a week more, itll be 5k and 10k by end of year.
Why would you buy so high?
You knew it was pumping because of the fork, and that it would dip after the fork.Why not wait until then?
sell now before it drops to 4 k. u have been warned
It's gonna drop a LOT more than that soon anon.
Get out of BTC and into the right alt now, you will recover your losses
