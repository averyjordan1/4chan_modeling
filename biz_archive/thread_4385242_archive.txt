k in debt from credit cards>>finally lock them away in a safe deposit box so I won't use them>>Credit used to be great, but now is shit>>Can't afford to pay down debt because of interest>>Credit is shit so can't get a loan>>Now I'm stuck in a (((loop)))Am I fucked, or is there a way out?

>falling for the credit-card memeThis is entirely your own fault and only solution is burning some of your family and friend's relationship to borrow some money without interest.If you are a lonely NEET with no relationships there is only one solution.
