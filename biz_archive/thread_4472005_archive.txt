>crtpyo market cap: approx $200bnDo you really think we're at the level of Intel or VISA?These established companies have products used by millions in every corner of the world, crypto is just hype.
Just think how many millions of VISA transactions there are daily but you say Bitcoin is worth just as much?Then if crypto will continue to moon 5x or 10x next year it would literally be bigger than Apple or Google.
Really?Crypto is cool but more overvalued than Tesla right now
Intel creates processors, VISA transactions.Crypto is a storage of wealth you idiot, its a different category.
