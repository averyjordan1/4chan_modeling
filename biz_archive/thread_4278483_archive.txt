Okay so im an oldfag crypto user just getting back into cryptos now.
I have 2 LTC on cryptopia available for trade and im wondering what to buy?
As an oldfag I want to just buy 100,000 doge but are there better coins to get in on for the next 2 or 3 days?
Buy one million doge and hold for a month.
Easy money.

I'd suggest Obsidian, $ODN, but you mentioning next 2-3 days makes me think you're not looking for a "longer hold" of 1 - 2 months.December and January should be some comfortable months for Obsidian, and the start of more product polishing.
On top of that, the price is low enough to buy 1 or 2 Masternodes which at the moment don't necessarily contribute more than just a "staking" balance rewarding 10% a year.
There are plans to utilize MN more in the future though.
