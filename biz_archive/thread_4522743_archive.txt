Currently sitting at 65 sat, great time to buy
It's at 65 for a reason.
I had 120K on coinpouch and its all gone.
*poof*.
Not even a transaction history anymore.
I'm never touching this shit again dude.
No it’s a great time to set stops if you’re really still in XVG after this coinpouch fiasco.
rumours have it that the verge team itself was responsible for the "hack"
That wouldnt surprise me man.
They are now saying that the "investigations are slowed because of thanksgiving.." Give me a fucking break.
That's right Jay.
The Verge team's unprofessional bullshit is the main reason I sold this shitcoin.
Missed deadlines and contradictary statements and devs claiming it's the fault of marketing and publicly bitching about them and claiming they fired a marketing guy for being involved in a PnD whale group.
The whole fucking thing stinks.
-40 is great time to buy this shitcoin
At first they were praising coinpouch as one of the safest IOS wallets.
Now they are saying to never trust third party wallets.
Instead of the users being the only ones to possess they wallet keys, rumors are they actually stored them within the fucking network.
Can you believe that shit?
As for now, this certainly seems like both parties are in collusion with eachother.
Who the fuck misses such a thing?!
Meanwhile, im robbed of 600 euro's.
But i'll have to wait for a proper response tho... it's thanksgiving and all.
Btw, i also strongly advice everyone using coinpouch for other coins to withdraw your coins asap.
If they can fuck up this bad... your other coins aren't safe there!
Don't fall for the fucking sweet talk like i and so many others did with xvg.
Just some friendly advice bro's.
rd party wallets, in general, are dumb for long term use.
