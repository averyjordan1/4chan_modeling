Hedge fund manager in Sydney, Australia here.
If any of you are half decent traders you're trying to figure out when BTC will reach its ATH between now and the BCH fork in 6 hours to dump it into BCH to maximize your holdings.
Good day /biz/
fork cancelledsorry pal
hey look another BCH shill thread
you wish
yeahi think 6800~6900you op?
I set my first profit target to 7k and second at 7.5k.
I reckon ATH will be somewhere between those two values.
Got in at 6.4k.
Yeah, no kidding fuckface.
TA only works to a certain degree though, and I hate uncertainty so I'll be sitting this one out.>inb4 muh trendlinesshit gets broken and invalidated all the times in crypto>muh oscillatorsfucking worthless lately>muh fib or ichisame as above
I'd say 6800.When BCH gets close to 1000 massive buy walls come in so that's the cheapest you'll be able to get it, just shot up back to 1100 on Bittrex.
Maybe two more chances to buy-in close to 1000.
Hey guys,I was off about two more chances to buy at 1000, when I posted that only one chance after that.We're only going up from here.I have information from our Korean partners within the firm that the ATH will be 4000, so I'd say sell at 3700 on next pump.
I usually charge 950/AUD an hour for this information.

Kek.
Why are you such an attention seeking whore?
Reconsider your life.
Spotted BTC bag holder.
Why waste time trying to predict this stupid mess instead of going into a safe haven like ETH.
More risk/more reward.
have fun on your $1500 daily swing rollercoaster
You're just some dirty leb aren't you?Even if you are a hedge-fund manager with primary school level english skills, there is no way people would pay you $950/hr.Seriously though, why even lie about shit like that?
Not lying.
