nice, are you staking in biz_classic?
I havn't had one damn faucet roll reach the second tier yet
Should I make my first position in ark now?
Sadly I only have 70USD on coinbase rn
yeah noiw is a good a time as anybuy off of binance for lower fees
70USDThat's $7000 in a year with ARK
Let's hope that's true!I think I'll use bittrex, I dont like binance that much because of the two decimal orders, I have small fractions of 20+ coins.
That value should be in ark!
THE PRICE DOESNT MOVE.
