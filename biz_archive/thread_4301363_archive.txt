I moved all my Link to BCC yesterday, but I'm about to drop my profits back into Link, I believe!!
should have gone with ebet
most of /biz/ is boycotting Bitcoin CashNot sure how you can say that, we've had 24/7 bcash shilling in here since it started mooning.
People also "boycotted" eth when it was very low priced and ready for the moon.... keep this in mind when making your decision on Link.
it started mooning like 2 weeks ago...when i bought it and opened the first thread about it.took profit today while u idiots chase the highs like amateurs
Link just sounds too good to be true.
But in this case, it is true.
I cannot wait until Link blows up and people have noose pictures and wojak all over talking about they could have bought under $1 back in 2017
go fud yourself to sleep fag

vocal minority of retards REEEEE>principled bitcoiners seeing Satoshi's Vision
/biz/ is one personif you can't into DYOR or CRITICAL THINKING then you aren't going to make it bro
most of /biz/ is boycotting Bitcoin CashWhat the fuck are you talking about?
I'm a newfag and biz told me heavily to get into BCH over and over, and I did and now have over 2x.
/Biz/ HEAVILY shilled for me to get into it, complete opposite of what you're saying.
Wrong i have being saying link is trash that will never be adapted hell it can't even get on a legit exchange
