My position on Gopro got liquidated
Was this an earnings play?
i heard they were going to shit a few years ago
yeah this my first one this was what id did>buy go pro after earning it dip hard>it dips harderBut why is it so shit I thouight gopro was profitable
i think it's a combination of a generally overpriced market, and the market would've been pricing in high earnings expectations, only to be disappointed.
Stop playing binary events with options holy shit.
Playing short expirations with high open interest is a recipe for disaster.
The big boys will almost always pin the price just enough that your options expire worthless, good earnings or not.
I see.
OP, seems like it's dropping due to reduced guidance going into 4th quarter.
Not good for a holiday season performance, I guess.
A couple resources for you on the subject.
You'll see this happen to MU (Micron Technology) and AMD a lot.
