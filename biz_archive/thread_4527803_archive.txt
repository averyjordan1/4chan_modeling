>Tfw got joosted by Confido and now already made it back and up 40% on HSTI want to thank that based anon who shilled this coin to me a few days ago.
Faith in /biz/ restored.
>not thanking the anon who shilled confidoIt's like you don't value a good lesson
Nah, that nigger made me lose 3k.
If it makes you feel better I had 1 btc last week and then tried to daytrade bch and ended up with 0.2.
Now I'm back to 1 btc again after doing some trades.
And this is just beggining, HST will make you a lot more, all of us.
Ouch.
I really hope you'll make 2 btc before 2018 comes, anon.
Maybe don't daytrade too much in the future.Yes, anon.
This coin honestly gives me hope that there are still coins with real potential out there.
Bless that anon who shilled HST to me.
