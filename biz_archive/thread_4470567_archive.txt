Sup, i know you guys don't wanna see my face around here, but i just sent out 3 Plushies to the people that contacted me.Scamtime is over, can you guys give me a second chance?Plan on going the legit way with either Etsy or Fiverr, where you have Scam-Protection.
Let me get one for free
Also i want to add, the Reason for this is i just realised i dont have to pay 15$ shipping fee if i dont send it in a package.There are those stuffed letters where my plushies fit perfectly in
quick push, biz is quite active right now
friss schei√üe nigger
Do you make the pepe one that people post in association with pajeet shill phrases or is that someone else?
This OP.
Give everyone on /biz/ a free LINK plushie and we're all good.
Too late.
I already trademarked the red wojack and have people on Fiverr in banglesh making them for $0.01 an hour.
Bump i think someone else did it with some random plushie.
Btw it would be great more pics like that
You never posted your gfs ass pics
