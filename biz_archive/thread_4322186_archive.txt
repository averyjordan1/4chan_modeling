Is the Confido hype over?
I am wondering if it will moon once it hits big exchanges.
Does anyone have insider information for binance listing?
This has at least another x4 in it when it does
I dropped my ICO bags, doubful a big exchange will list CFD without a PoC which is months out
Binance lists coins without PoC
Hype hasn't even begun for this
It's steadily rising completely unfazed by this bitcoin drama
>$8.5 million market cap>steady, organic rise>no one dumping>real news still to comeAnd anons here think it's done?
