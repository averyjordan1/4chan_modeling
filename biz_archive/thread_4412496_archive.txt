LINK 300 BY 2018
Ill be shit rich if so.
13.4k linkie here.
people who understood the importance of smart contract + large number of developers made a lot of money by trusting in eth in 2016 to 2017.
People who understand the need for oracles to connect the real world with the new crypto economy have another great chance in 2017 going to 2018.
Link is the ticket.
You just got to jump in the ride.
All in 140k at 0.40 just literally fuck my shit up.
More like DGB dejavu>muh memes>muh conference>muh long term hodl>muh it's not pump&dumpfucking lmao
comparing the solution to the oracle system and the connection with SWIFT to a minecraft server.
*lol*
that was ETH though, Link is just a shit erc token.
thinking product means shit in the crypto market>not realizing 99% percent of the people in crypto don't know what blockchain is let alone oraclesyou've got pumped&dumped, the sooner you accept it the better.
Be glad that it's still above ICO price and sell or else you'll end up with sharpies in your butthole like the digimarines
WTF is DGB for?
A fast bitcoin?
There are plenty of alternatives.
It's not revolutionary.At least LINK is trying to solve a problem that we don't already have a solution for.
ThisLINK has a point.
It is however difficult to adapt.
Then one billion total supply.
Almost impossible to hit even 1 USD for a long time ahead.
