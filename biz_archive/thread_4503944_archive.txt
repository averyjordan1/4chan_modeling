Hey guys, newfag hereWhat do you guys think of Smartcash?Some dude was talking about it in the comments, so i looked it up and noticed that price bump.Found out that they give out 15% of all mined blocks on every 25th of a monthIts market cap is somewhat 20 million/biz/ should i buy some and sell it in three days or is it too risky?
go all in
