Hey /BIZ/ its the cafe guy again.Been a while.Found out i only need 20k AUD to start building interest and to also live of that said interest.Any tips on how to get money fast and easy.
That wont corrupt my soul.
Live off 20k AUD?
Suck a dick 20k times
Buy 1 pair kneepads
20k in a savings account provides 400 a month in interest.
That means i can pay most of my rent every second month.
30k means i can pay all the rent.50k means i can live off it completely.Ect ect.Living off interest means all my pay goes into savings thus increasing the interest ect ect.Cant suck dick well.
Plus too tired from wage cucking.
Wait what.
2% interest a month?
That cant be right.
You should double check.
hes talking about a bank or some stupid shit
and what fucking bank provides 2% a month anon????
this...sounds like wishful thinking
