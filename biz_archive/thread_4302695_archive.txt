Why does coinbase charge me $5 or more in (((network fees))) to transfer BTC while blockchain is $1.50
because coinbase defaults to "high speed" transactionwhich in bitcoin terms mean 12 hours
>not controlling your private keys and setting the fee yourselfKill yourself
>tfw no commie qt gf
Maybe there's an off chance that she isn't a commie and the dyed hair is a cosplay.
Isn't that the girl from Trump protest videos?

Well, nevermind then.
Fucking thanks for perpetuating the stereotype that dyed hair is only for the left, libs.
she's part of antifa
Generally bitches who have colorful hair are hipster, feminist, SJW, "I got raped because I got wasted at a college party, fucked someone and regretted it" leftist scum.
Commie>Business and Financethat's an oxymoron if I've ever seen one
well commie china gamblers are fucking crypto right now
Cancerous antifa whore
Wrong.
$5 goes through in less than 10 minutes.
I was really hoping they were just pretending to be anime.
Which is cute but if thats the reasoning for dyed hair then whats the point
How did this shit even happen anyways.
Japan is the most perverted country, yet feminism is such a very small minor subject there.
Where we go so wrong?
Are we sensitive?
Is it the things we watched?
Is it the food we eat?
I just dont get it
