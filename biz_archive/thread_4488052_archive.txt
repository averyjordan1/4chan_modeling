BTC
Didn't buy powr when you had a chance huh
Long BTC on 100x leverage.
Here're some of the coins/token, I believe have great future potential: Monero, Ark, Tio, Stratis and Salt.

Ark,WTC, OMG and I can see Vechain take you to the promised land

Poor fattie, who invited him
Chancoin is the best deal right now.
We're goin viral..........only 6 million coins and it's around 434 Satoshi right.
A fuckin steal if you ask me.
even .5 BTC will garner a good seed investment.
It's on Cryptopia under "4CHN" if you care.
ETH & POWR
BTC (I shit you not).Will take some time though highest possibility to 10x
