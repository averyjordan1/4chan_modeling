Through family ties I have an opportunity to make 25% per year interest....if I invest $1million.Now these are government bonds so pretty safe.
Over 4 years I could double that million.
Live off the first, and reinvest the second to get a third.However, I don't have that million, I have Â£70k (inc crypto)...So frustrating.
Always knew that a single million isn't enough to retire on, and would still have to take some risky investments etc to make it last a lifetime, however I now have the OPPORTUNITY to safely resolve that, plus leave loads for the kids.
I have the plan but don't have the capital.
Argh!If only I could get a "small loan of a million dollars" like Trump I'd be set for fucking life.
I don't even need rich people shit, I'd live pretty frugally.
Just I'm 30 soon and want to retire, rather than wagecuck for another 45 years, at least..
They almost got you 25% / 4 yearsThats just an inflation rate ;) maybe, just maybe 2-3% profit
lol if a bond is paying you 25% interest there is either% chance of default>inflation of 20-22%
Nope, developing country.Also that rate is ONLY for $1million.
~6% for anything lower.
Think about it, they want people to invest money in the country, so they can build it.
To do that they have to entice people to give them a million to play around with.
As long as that million generates more than $250000 for the country (and for a govt that's not hard), then it's worth it for them.
