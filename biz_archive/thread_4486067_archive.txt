tether is probably not fraudulentwhy are they releasing tethers at an increasing rate?
as demand for tether increases they need to print more to keep the price from rising above 1 dollarit is as simple as that.
If it's not fraudulent why won't they do an audit?
as demand for tether increases they need to print more to keep the price from rising above 1 dollarso an exchange loses all banking and suddenly everyone wants to put their money into it?
how are they buying in without banking
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#marketsbitfinex accounts for % of tether volume
 tether always equal to 1 usd, read their site
yes but if there are only 100 tethers and there is demand via exchanges for 10000 tethers, they will be priced above 1 dollarso tether needs to create more to satisfy the demandthe price is not inherently 1 dollar, it stays that way because they create more to satisfy increasing demand (otherwise tether would be mooning)
Their terms and conditions say they do not have any obligation to redeem tethers for USD.
Read their site.
bitfinex accounts for % of tether volumeThat's only because Bitfinex doesn't officially give the Tether ticker to all their ""fiat"" pairs.
If they did it would look much different.
Sucks they got hacked
And what if demand for tether decreases?
They have to take tether out of the system to keep the price from falling below 1 dollar?
How would they do that?
Great, but they need to have enough money to back it up, If the demand out paces bitfinexes supply of USD they can not justify printing more tether because "muh market demands"
