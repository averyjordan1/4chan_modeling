The KING
Monero 1000$ coin
Seriously undervalued

Ive been all in for a while.
No need to shill because everyone knows XMR is #1
Monero is actually unstoppable.
I'm in for 500 xmr @ $90, give daddy das gains
will surpass ETH for sure
This triggers the dashie
shhh, dont shill this here, I dont want all these ADHD faggots destroying our coin
While you are investing in Monero, be sure not to miss the boat on Blocknet as well.
Blocknet's DEX is the "Monero" of exchanges.
I love that the devs at Monero and Blocknet are some of the few people left fighting for Satoshi's dream of being trust-less, anonymous & decentralized.
If anyone out there has ZCash you better dump it for the real deal Monero asap...Monero is truly 100% private!
500$ Q2 2018
I bet you my XMR that XMR will be $300 just by the end of November
4249715stop hyping this dudes, the last we need is attracting the moonkids with weak hands
Zcash is up 13% in 3 days.
What's wrong with owning both?
I invest long term in my crypto and thus I invest a lot of my time into research.
This pic is a QUICK summarization.
