WHO HERE GETTING JUSTED RIGHT NOW?
My biggest alts are ark and vtc.
So yeah.. pretty fucking judged
Jesus fuck i meant justed
I bought 5k worth of xmr at 170
Sell now, recouperate losses with BCH > BTC flippening.
Don't be an emotional hodler.
Ark has too much and better-than-them competition and VTC will never take off because it's just a better bitcoin.
dw bud it'll be back up soon when this bch/btc bullshit really goes crazy
