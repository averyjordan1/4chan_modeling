what will you buy once you make it with COSS ??
scam coin coss pajeet.
Stay away from this scam crashed 75% and this guy shilling this garbage.
If it reaches 1/2 the volume of binance, it will be worth $6 per coin.
Just wait and you will cry
when moon :(?
plus - if you have your coins on the site you get a bonus every Sunday - like what Quionpro did - I got .5BTC off that when all done - well worth a couple clicks and shekels :)
Too heavy bags?
they can not be heavy enough right now, this is THE moon mission
There's absolutely 0 chance it ever reaches 1/2 the volume of binance.
A saddle for my flying pig.
sure it could because the crypto market is expanding in the next years
Coin of 2018 , mark my word pajeet

Fiat/alt pairs will surely help, if they ever figure that out.
At current crypto growth rates, in 2 years today's 1/2 Binance volume will be a very low tier exchange volume.
COMFY COSS
Fiat is up on Q1 2018 ( they just wait MAS in singapor , for the new regulation )
NOT DONE ACCUMULATINGDELETE NOW
you had plenty of time
