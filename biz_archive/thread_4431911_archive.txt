Will this shit ever recover?
I fucking hope so.
I bought this shit because people were shilling it here.
me tooim getting justed hereand its not even some pajeet coin teams Australian its strange im not even seeing any post ico "new coin " pump
its been trading less than a week.
if you get ADD and sell you'll be the one buying back in at ATH when they announce major cities and multinational corporations using their voting solution in december.
Dump it so I can accumulate more while you chase your next "moon mission" (aka FOMOing other coins at their ATH)
now hold on I got faith in it3 exchanges in 2 weeks is pretty goodhope the price reflects it
it'll be available for trading on a few exchanges including kucoin in about 12 hours.
i think it's pretty normal for a dip before such events (people trying to manipulate price to buy cheaper)
only way to win the etherdelta shitcoin roullete.
is to accumulate a coin without making the price go up so you hold a bunch.
then start to shill the fuck out of if.
after shilling you put small amounts for sale and pump it up with another account.
this way it looks like its actually pumping.
then slowly sell it during the pumps this way you allowing others to get in on your shills and also start to shill for you.
after that you have already sold most of your stack and made your profit.
so your sitting comfy and everyone is shilling your coin that you accumulated for and sold to everyone else for higher so all their bags are higher then your buy in already.... you cant buy in after a fomo and expect to win.
thats someone else that just made profit on you.
Buying hst will end up being the best decision of your life, anon.
Give it some time then.Afaik it's only on etherdelta rn,
I dumped it last night, depth chart looks terrible, everybody talking about "It'll moon when on more exchanges!"
with the hopes of dumping... Its not looking good, I think theres gonna be a bunch of bagholders
