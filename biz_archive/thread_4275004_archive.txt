So Blocknet saw some significant gains recently, like 36%, partly because of the B2X suspension I guess, and because all alts are gaining, but probably partly also because they have a countdown on their page:https://blocknet.co/(top bar) - it's about their GUI reveal.
they're basically building a 100% decentralized exchange (not like others; it's purely atomic swaps and even the order books are decentralized via nodes) - and have partnered with a major UI/UX firm that worked with big companies like IBM & Facebook , among others So this GUI they will show will be a big thing, because we will have a 100% dx atomic swaps based exchange WITH amazing looking trading GUI... but can this be enough to propel the price even further, or will it be the typical "sell the news"?What do you advise bros?
Sell some now before the show begins?
Bump.... no BLOCK holders?
The UI will be killer but this shit will really boost when they get spv.
Until then you have to host the full chains of coins you want to trade.
In the future it'll be possible to use light wallets to trade.
Then that's the big moon.
The DEX is only the first application of their platform.
Comfy with 1k block and 1/5 of a service node with some frienda.Never selling.
