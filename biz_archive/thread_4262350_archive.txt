Are you fucking retarded /biz/?
There are going to be some sad bagholders soon.
I'm the OP from last night that talked about NULS.
It was severely undervalued (was 9m cap when I bought), so I gave the shill a shot and went ham.
I knew it'd at least double but didn't expect it to rise so quick.
Cashed out and now am /comfy/.
A $40m valuation on a coin with no wp, no team, and no roadmap is insane.Team is supposedly delivering the WP tomorrow, so that should be good for those who bought at the high today.For it to go to $2, though, it needs to have an $80m market cap.
Not even VeChain (established partnerships) has that MC yet.
its not too late 4 u brodiegrow up.
some people have info follow it and take heart.at least so many of your peers are in the green now.

Haha no team, no whitepaper, I just sold at 16k - will get back in for another run down at 12-13.RSI way overbought, smart people will sell and rebuy.
MFW people throw money at a random project like NULS when theres a coin that's still below ICO with a proven team and big name backers
Actual idiots.
Look at the catalog.
Kek the absolute state of /biz/
