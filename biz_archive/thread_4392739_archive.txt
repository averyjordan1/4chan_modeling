Both are still on the 0.0... What is the fiture of these cheap altcoins.I am of the opinion that these are still worth going long on the gamble.
No other coins can offer the potential gains of these 2 for the newb investor that missed out on the btc rush
Correct
Doge is an awesome investment right now.
Technicals are perfect for takeoff
It's an anon that looks at the price and compares it to Bitcoin while ignoring market cap and supply episode.Are you looking at them thinking: "wow, Bitcoin is over 7k and these are still pennies!!
The potential!!"
Because if so you are the biggest dumbass.
At least it's stable as fuck
I agree, Doge has huge potential to takeoff.
Great investment, i;ve been stacking for a long time
