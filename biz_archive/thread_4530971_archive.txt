Im cashing out.How do I pay the capital gains tax on my earnings?
Anyone have experience with this?

Calculate the gains/losses on each of your trades in terms of your currency via FIFO/FILO/ACB.
Then pay the relevant amount of tax according to your tax rules.Get an accountant if your really stuck.
Each trade in itself?
That sounds autistic.
It's not just the overall?
Why would you pay taxes you cuck?
Whats the alternative?

i'd just do the overall...in the us, the long term cap gains rate is different from short term cap gains, so you should split your trades into those two camps, but there's no way i'm going to try to tally 000's of trades over years on different exchanges.
