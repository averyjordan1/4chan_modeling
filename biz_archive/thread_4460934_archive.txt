Hello Biz, wanted to share an experiment I've been conducting over the past few weeks.I have 40+ influential twitter, reddit, bitcointalk and cryptotalk accounts.I made about 400k off DGB during the summer and dropped my bags around 2100 Sats.
I have since then bought back 20MM DGB coins at the low prices in the past few weeks.I have launched an all out attack on Jared, DGB, and the DGB community.
I'm using all of my resources to assault them and crash the price.
Constant FUD, verbal attacks, mean spirited attacks, technical and well thought out essays attacking the integrity of the coin and it's usefulness, and random shitposting as well.My goal is to crush Jared and his team's spirit and cause them to exit the crypto world.
Why?Because it's fucking hilarious and I do this for fun.
If Jared somehow triumphs over the onslaught of attacks and mockery against him (not just me, obviously, he is famously hated) then I win with my 20MM coins that will have gone interstellar.If he fails (preferably committing suicide), then I will consider it a successful psy-op attack and I will have gained valuable insight on how to leverage my social networks.Join me.
Burn DGB down.
This gets posted every week.
Copy and paste.
It's a reverse shill.
Look idiot, just post the actual, factual tech behind DGB rather than trying to fucking shill it like a brainlet would.
If people want to buy at that point, they can.
