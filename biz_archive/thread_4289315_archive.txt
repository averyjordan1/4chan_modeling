is there even any money to be made in crypto if you aren't trading full time?as a student I can't devote very much time to this and it seems like you gotta be trading the single digit percents to still be making gains these days
No.
Plenty of money can be made by buying a solid project and just forgetting about it.
As long as you don't pick shit coins (and crypto market doesn't crash) you will make out like a bandit.
Too much ADHD on this board.
If they aren't buying and selling constantly they get nervous.
I guess I should have said "yes"
If you aren't buying/selling constantly you get JUST'd in the ass.
We're in a bear market right now, you can't just hold things and be in the green all the time
