How do you spoof orders on EtherDelta?I've seen orders filled way above or below the mid-market price without filling orders in between.
Supposedly most of these are just people trading with themselves to trigger price alerts and try to fool the market.
How is this possible?
There's absolutely no regulations in cryptoWho's gonna stop em?
Who do you report market manipulation to?
Ahah enjoy the bag
No shit, I'm asking how you do it.
Welcome to ED mate.
You don't fill orders placed unless you select them.
Which is why you often see sell orders lower than the highest buy.That's the beauty of it.
It's a shame bots get all those orders, I think a couple of /biz/lamists have managed to pull some crazy orders
put up high buy order, sell to that high buy order.
SImples.

So it's really as easy as placing some ridiculous order nobody else would ever fill, then filling it yourself?
