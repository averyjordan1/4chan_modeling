last night I made an order for BTC on Coinbase through bank transfer, and they said it would arrive in 8 days.
If my checking account hasn't been charged yet, am I able to avoid buying that BTC at the shitty price of $7200?
HALP
No.
You are stuck.
Just own it and move on.
If I put a hold on my bank, will coinbase blacklist me?
Did you upload your DL photo?
Or do any major verification etc?
You may be able to say ID fraud but itâ€™s also illegal to lie about it
yes you idiot.You are literally the reason it takes 8 days.Crypto is irreversible, fiat can be pulled by a stop payment.Its cuz of fucking cheap assholes like you trying to game the system that we all have to wait so long.Fuck you
are you retarded?its just coinbase being shit and stealing you
how can one be such retard?
doesn't into gdaxOuch
