Hello /biz/I have just dumped all my btg on bittrex and I am now looking for some moon missions that I can buy and forget with my "free" money.
In total I have 10 btc to spend on whatever coin(s) biz shills the hardest for.The only coin so far I'm considering putting a few btc in is SALT but that can only moon a Max of 5-8x right now so I may consider others.
