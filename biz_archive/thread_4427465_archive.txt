You fellow marines do realize that next month is the make or break month for LINK.
SWIFT is going to announce its partnership in December.
Whatever price LINK is keeping now its only because there's a possibility that SWIFTs partnership is indeed link.
If that's the case LINK is going to atleast $5If its not, however, LINK is going straight to ZERO.Pray hard we make it.
