I'm thinking about buying into confido now.
Seems like an excellent opportunity to make 3-6x.The confido team didn't sell any of their 4.5MM coins, so there will probably be a resurgence at some point.
What does Biz think?
I have a similar line of thought but I'm waiting a few days.
The slight uptrend now could just well be a deadcat bounce from people looking to get out.
wait a few days to make it less risky
normally I would agree but this coin is ranked around 500 so I'd say the gamble of volatility is not worth the reward.
call coin "confido">lose all confido within 2 weeks of the debutI would wait desu
Wait for it to go sub ICO, then think about it.
thanks for the pic had a good laugh
