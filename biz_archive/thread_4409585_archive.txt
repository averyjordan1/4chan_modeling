No bagholder here.But since I'm only seeing Wojaks and cry threads about how chainlink broke families and bank accounts, I consider to buy it now.Because... always do the opposite what 4chan says
uhhhhh y-yeah Haha don't buy link please... Haha it's a bad idea right now anon.
don't buy link haha
from the start people said this is a longterm holdpeople who bought at 50 cent and sell now are just mentaly retardedthis is the lowest what it will ever be again.
Thats not how it works you king of morons
dubs of truth.
this is the lowest what it will ever be again.I'm a long-term all-in Link holder, but don't say this, man.We don't know how much more the BTC-BCC thing is going to fuck over the alt market.
i'm a king... holy shit i'm honoredanyways yeah i agree with , link is gonna be enormous soon
He probably means FIAT wise, not BTC wise
Well the BTC-BCC thing is bleeding alts of fiat as well.
Fucking Jihan Fu
I own 10k link.
How many more should i buy?
I own 10 ether and 1 btc
All in on linkThe chances that you make it big with bitcoin or eth outweigh the biggest chance you have to never work again
I just bought 10k Link.
Am I going to be a bagholder?
Exactly right.
/biz/ was shitting on BCH all day, then it rose by .05 BTC.
They are now calling everyone corecucks.
Now BCH is falling again.2 days ago, they were making fun of ETH for the twitter fiasco (rightly so), but ETH rose 10% after that.
When theres no news for a long time tgr pruce stagnates and slowely devalues.
It will continue slowely devaluing until news comes out.
No, the the (((block steam)))
