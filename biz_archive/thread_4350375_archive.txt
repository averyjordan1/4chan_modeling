eBitcoin [EBTC] is a versatile token for a store of mega wealth that can also be used as a medium of small transactions.
ALL IN ONE.
Just wait for what the devs have in store for the EBTC community.
It's going to be lights out for Bitcoin and it's derivative.
You can take this to the bank.
People that still hold BTC and its derivatives are beholden to miners just like normies are beholden to big banks.
They suffer from cognitive dissonance and are masochistic.
These people enjoy painful waiting times for transactions and high fees.
But they will soon be forced to kiss proof of work goodbye when ethereum enacts proof of stake.
Bitcoin is an endangered species.
Bet your bottom dollar on that.
