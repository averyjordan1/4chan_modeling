It has been like 20 hours since I made priority transfer from wallet to exchange.
Still not a single confirmation.
I want to dump my BTC for BCH while its still below 0.3.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
don't the BCH buys will be tired eventually ETH / ETC store your money through this crazyness unless you want to start at your computer to and predict Sell and Buy points It's going to be a Pump and Dump game for at least 3 / 4 more days.
The flippening is real and nothing will stop it.
At least I made smart moves last week and transferred the majority of my BTC to BCH.
I just want to get rid of the remaining coins.
What's the ppoint of hodling them?
Blockstream Bitcoin is heading to triple digit prices.
