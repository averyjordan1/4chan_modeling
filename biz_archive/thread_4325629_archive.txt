Which do you use?
Iâ€™m really new and only know Coinbase
sorry but if you are new you will just lose your money if you try to trade.

now get out of biz and never come back you brainlet piece of crap
I don't know where you come off talking to folks like that, MISTER, but this is 4chan and we treat each other with respect.
If you don't like it then, well, you can just leave!
