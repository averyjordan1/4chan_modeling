How do you motivate yourself to work harder?I could make so much more money if I focused on my work more, but I lack self control and waste most of my time.Please give me some advice.
Certainly not with the material goals in your pic.That superficial shit doesn't really amount to all that much in regard to motivation I reckonI think you would be better off working on something you are passionate about.
Maybe it's the thrill of setting a goal and achieving it, challenging yourself to becoming rich as almost a game, maybe it's about being the best at something, but i think you are better off with goals that involve yourself which is really the only thing in your life you can control.Also more money won't automatically make you happy just FYI
Do you enjoy your work?
That's key for me.
It doesn't feel like work because I enjoy doing it.
If you enjoy something you'll do it well.
lol yes it will, anyone that says this has never been wealthy
I'M EXACTLY THE SAME
But money will take care of a lot of worries and open even more doors.
Find the right job.
Im in bliss at my tech job rn working 18 hr days without even noticing it.
Focus on your work more
