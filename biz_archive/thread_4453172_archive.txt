God dammit why didnt I invest in the Bulgaria 3-Year Treasury Note
that will happen because there was a large drop in market price of the bond, probably not a good sign
how does a bond get to negative price?
are you asking why a bond's market price would drop?well, if supply exceeds demand (just like anything), prices will dropi'm not sure of why people are selling this bond though.
May have something to do with what a central bank is doing to with rates, or maybe people are doubting they're going to be repaid/ receive interest payments on the bond
