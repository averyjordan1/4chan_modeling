Finally pos is going up thanks for saying no to the fork.
this bag was getting too heavy
good time to accumulate or naw?
its trended historically around ,20-25 i think its a safe 10% short term could even moon today with all the volatility - would take about 10% of the volume to move it that far but not entirely impossible
nice.
thanks.

BAT is not a short term P&D coin.This nigger is financed by shit other than it's ICO, it will survive even the longest altwinter.
BAT is your ticket to early retirement.
this is the only coin that has a product you can use today - the brave browser
which has nothing to do with BAT right now other than you can donate your BAT lolI had 60k of these shitcoins and they cost me thousands of dollars.
Should have sold when it ran up to 30 cents...
why not hold until it goes up again?
obviously will.
you lost money because you lost your patience
Finally BAT is low enough to buy.
Wen in with 10% of portofoliowith the fork over, expect it to rise!
