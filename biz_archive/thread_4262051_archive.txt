Normies are scared of investing in crypto for a myriad of reasons.
To profit from normie uselessness, I came up with this two-word concept:retailBitcoin.Laugh all you want.
This will boom.
retail is already done in bitcoin illegally on silk road and darkmagic (?)
And it's very successful.
Companies tend to not know how to adapt this into it because of plenty of factors including reputation with illegal connections,terrorism, etc.
Until this image is erased or companies make a new term for it, it is wasted potential.
Your idea is nothing new
If Walmart started rolling out Bitcoin ATMs throughout their stores Bitcoin's price would skyrocket
Please elaborate...
Why?
Do you think normies would buy Bitcoin to spend at Walmart?
here in Slovenia you can buy Bitcoin in only one bank but on all gas stations.
So i guess you are onto something...
lol using bitcoin to buy shit from walmart.Maybe monero would work, or god forbid DGB
