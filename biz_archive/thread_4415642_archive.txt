I think of bitcoin nowadays as a pure store of value i.e.
"digital gold".
Consider that there is a fixed, finite supply available of bitcoin unlike gold, whose annual supply increase is 1-2%.
From the perspective of a pure store of value, bitcoin is more effective than gold due to its fixed supply, portability and easily retrievable and transferable nature.
It doesn't matter what transactions fees are because it no longer, in my opinion, qualifies as a day-to-day spending currency, to be used in the purchase of other goods/services.
Leave that to other, more technologically suited cryptocurrencies like ETH, LTC or BCH.
I think of blockstream coin as a pure ponzi scheme that has abandoned the attributes that built its adoption in the first place.

First of all bitcoin never was nor ever will be fungible, so it doesn't meet one of the key properties of being electronic cash.Second, I don't care what Satoshi intended bitcoin to be.
I care about why today it is perceived to have value, and why under my rationale it could still be considered undervalued.

XMR is an even better store of value.
