Anyone who is holding now is just bag holding and will only suffer.
LOLbagholder spreading fake bullshit to try to dump at a decent price.Sorry that he already said it had nothing to do with China, bro.
Maybe next time dont go all in during a pump
Honey Badger Chinks don't give a fuck about no basement dwelling 4 of Chubs trying to drive Neo down to $2 so they can buy back in with Cheto and Mt.
Dew.

You ARE fake bullshit.
Checked.

I sold all my Link and bought at 620.
I just wanted a quick pump to 700 to buy more Link...Should I get out now or will I get a final exit pump to get even?
https://twitter.com/MalcolmLerider>Good newspretty sure that news is tech related.
nobody wants that shit.
its going to dump if its not related to the government.
Angry bagholder mad he bought at $46Just buy back when it dumps from the announcement.
You can increase your NEO even if you are currently at a loss.
This and they admitted it is not government related so it's fucking useless news.
GOVERMENT NEWS OR NOTHING YOU RETARDED CHINKS.Nobody gives a flying fuck about neo's stupid ass platform.
Or what new shit they have, all people care about is whether ico's are allowed again and if the the government endorses it.
Anything else does not fucking matter.
