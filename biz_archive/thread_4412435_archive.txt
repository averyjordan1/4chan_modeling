Should I get in at 7k BTC?Let's say I put 1k in and BTC is worth 14k in a year (it was 2k in 2016), I only made 1000 dollars in one yearwhat a shitty investment
Buy alt coins for cheap right now and then trade them for BTC when you get sick gains several months down the line
nice try, all alts are scamsnormalfags only know and care about BTC, maybe LTC
you're right.
tfw I doubled my money on alt coins
200% a year is a shitty investmentyou need money to make money in this game
>If it goes up 100% then I'll have not made much because I won't have put more in>what a shitty investment>anime picLet me guess, you're some retarded poorfag that blows most of his money on garbage.
what I described is 100% you brainlet
It wasn't 2k in 2016.
It was literally less than a thousand this year.
I'll be amazed if it has similar returns percentage wise next year.
I'll also be a millionaire, which I find unbelievable, I can't be rich.
how much do you have in crypto right now?
BTC and then another 4.2BTC or so in alts.
Might as well spend it on fast food and video games, right buddy?
congrats
100% increase to 200% capitalCan you not split hairs, you fucking faggot?
nope, alts are bleeding.youre gonna lose a lot more money than gain with the state of the market
