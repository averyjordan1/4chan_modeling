I just got BTC to try and make something to get out of my shitty apartment for my soon to be children and wanna get into some smaller cryptos I'm a complete noob so i dont know what platform to go with , preferably one that I can trade fiat for small coins.Any help would be much appreciated
I was recommended bitfinex and there was a lot of praise online but they seem to be about to go down the shitter from what I'm reading on here
That would be great to have tips and all but I don't know what platform to buy anything with .
I only got a fiat-BTC and BTC-ETH.
Any good platforms?
Bittrex, binance, Poloniex google bruh
Don't get scammed, stay away from those groups.
Lurk more, meanwhile keep 90% in btc, the other 10% in shitcoins to get your feet wet.
Before dropping any more in alts make sure you are able to make consistent gains while outperforming btc.Readreadread
