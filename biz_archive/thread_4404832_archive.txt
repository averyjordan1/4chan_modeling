At this point i absolutely give up on making it through crypto.
I'm leaving my 50k LINK, 1500 SALT, and 50k REQ for a year and considering them money lost.
So I'm planning on a way to make it without crypto.How feasible is it to start a business with 45k?
I'm a computer science graduate so it would be preferable for it to be tech/online related.
I have 0 morals either so I'm willing to go to the grey area of business.
I live in a poor country btw not burgerland.
nigga it's possible to start a business with $0 and some motivation just get off your ass and do it
This.Most people who want to run a successful business even with no money, will go set one up.
Was jack ma even legit poor?
I thought that was a meme rich people used like bill gates dropping out (even though his family was rich as fuck).
Are you kidding me?
You have enough capital to buy 20x ASIC miners and profit 60-70k per year.
ASIC minersI dont really want to put it in something crypto related anymore hahaha.
Getting JUSTed hard by LINK is enough.
I still believe it will moon though but its better if i consider it money lost.
LINK MOONING
What's your business idea?
