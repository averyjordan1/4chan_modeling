People are crazy for not buying as much ETH as they can, Proof of stake is coming out next year.
We'll be able to earn residual from the interest without needing a bank.
Also buying a TenX card for living on the gains and some PAY tokens since I think many will do the same.
For anyone wondering, I started in crypto in 2016 with $1k.
Its been a wild ride.
Hodler 4 life.
how do you do it
eth address + proof or GTFO
I think the problem is that at $300 per eth most anons wont be able to buy enough to get a decent return on staking it.
also give eth pls rich man
how much is required?
In all honesty, do you guys think all this pedocoin bizzo is gonna have any real negative impact on eth?
buy ICOhodlprofit
Prob 1k or a couple hundred
you can always join a group to stake if you happen not own enough.
No one knows.
Vitalik has said that every eth would count.
So you need 1.
Probably.
yes, trips confirm
There's bound to be staking pools.
Even if you had the necessary amount, you likely wouldn't want to do the validator work yourself.
