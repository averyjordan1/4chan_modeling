Tomorrow's PBC pick, SLR, has dipped to 7k sats on a refuel.
Might want to buy before it takes off again.
But there's no letter tomorrow.
Monday.It's FCT or POWR btw.
trust me or don't, i don't care.
just giving you guys a heads up.
Lol FCT has already been recommended, and regarding the retarded OP, why would they shill a 3 year old dead shitcoin?
Its powr, youre still on time, the rockets are fueled
powr team confirmed no MIT connection on their tg last night.would teeka pick a coin that is already active internationally or vaporware that came out a few weeks ago?
Yeah, only reason I'm not 100% on board with you is POWR got pumped and he may want to avoid another ZEN situation.
Will anger his subscribers.So he might actually be delaying POWR (though that letter going around is fake)In regards to the FCT thing, you're right, already featured, but I think Teeka is running out of non shitty coins, and FCT is still underpriced.
All his other recommendations are already pumped, so he may need to start revisiting or rehyping older stuff heh.
Grs
