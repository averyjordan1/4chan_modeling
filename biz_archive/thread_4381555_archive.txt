WHO HERE FEEL FOR ANOTHER PAJEET SCAMCOIN?
BOUGHT AT FIRST DIP AND STILL GOT ABSOLUTELLY JUST'DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
from what I'm reading it looks like a long-term coin, I don't think it will moon in less than 1 year.
It's only on ED right now.
Wait a week or so before it hits other exchanges and is more widely known
long-term coin
