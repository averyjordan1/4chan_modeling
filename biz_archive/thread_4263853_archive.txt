So how can anyone still have faith in Bitcoin and its devs after today's clown fiesta?
Either these imbeciles are complete idiots, or they don't understand the responsibility they have controlling the coin that the whole game is based on.How the hell can they announce an upgrade, screw the whole market environment (because bitcoin=king) and then turn around and go "tee gee guess we didn't get enough upvotes.
We cancel now, sorry boys.
"Like what in the actual fuck?
This isn't a motherfucking game.
How the hell am I expected to trust anything related to bitcoin now?
Where the fuck is the due diligence?
Where the fuck are the contingencies?If any real company pulled the shit they did today they'd be dragging their balls through glass shards to get out.
These monkeys get away scott free, AND will rinse and repeat this bullshit.This is how government regulations will begin boys, fuck all the guys involved.
I like it, everything that's not Bitcoin is going up.
no coiners still trying to cope
You realise that Bitcoin core strongly opposed the fork in the first place, rightThat's why it was a hardfork
