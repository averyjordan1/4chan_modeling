Bitfinex is cashing out:https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/wallet/Bitfinex-coldwallet
so what does it mean?
Why the fuck would they transfer money out of their cold wallet you if they were cashing out you stupid fuck.
Crypto market suffers many casualties
So, you are saying that bitfinex is clearly solvent, and it shows how nobody really has any trouble transacting bitcoins in the real world, right?I mean, if you're not saying that, it's a spectacular own goal you've just scored.
that's users cashing out
Let's see if this turns into a bank run or not.

The only thing that cashed out so far was your mind.
So far they've spent about $165 Million in coins this morning.
Spending in batches of 1,000, 2,000, 4,000Perhaps they'll claim it was a hack
We are really fucked now.
But hopefully it'll recover in the long run.
Temp cash out I think may be the best option.
At least I'll sleep good for a while
Based comment is based
Why do the Bitfinex shills appear in force when Americans are typically fast asleep?What time is it in Hong Kong, anyway?肏你妈,笨蛋。
