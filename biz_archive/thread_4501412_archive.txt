holding my 1350 iota.
cashing my link stash out to buy power ledger on the ups, sell, buy more link about at cost from my original sale.
feels good
>buying link
>IOTA, POWERBuying hypecoins that already mooned... and might never get really big, IOTA because it might never do what it claims to try to do, powr because it has 324234 competitors and many of the "big partnerships" aren't partnerships at all but stuff like minor grants or stuff unrelated to them that they try to imply is related to them like the new BMW stuff.
ive sextuppled my link stash since sub $0.20 buying dips.
DESU, i feel great about the project.
Ive invested enough though, its all shorts and small gains on other coins to contribute to increasing my link holdings.
COMFEY!!!
ANON.... in the past few weeks, most coins have been at the mercy of BTC,BCH and the mssive swings.
guess which one has been quietly mooning???
does that mean that ill hold it forever because this week is good????
likely ill sell it when it starts to dip... like every other fucking coin.
comfey is green without the fear of a big red everytime i grab a drink.
iota currently is doing it for me.
do what you do
but in talks of long term... no transaction fee coupled with a non blockchain network that gains efficiency with an increase in use??
honestly, the coin has no viable competitor when taking those 2 very important aspects into account.
i will try and keep 1000 at all times.
i will short and maintain my loss/gain.
but youd be a fool not to keep your eye on this one.
OKex later today BTW.
hoping for a nice chinese pump before i pull the sell trigger
