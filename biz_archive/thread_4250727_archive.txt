>link mooningnooooooooooMy one solace of being in bag holder hell was that the linkies were here with me, and the obese Sergey and toilet memes provided endless ammunition to insult and abuse them.Now link looks like it may actually be successful, who do I make fun of now?
It dumped hard because people were buying Bitcoin in the fork and there were only 2% of LINKs in circulation trading so its quite easy to manipulate.
Now that everyone is buying, what do you nolinkers think will happen since only a few LINKs are on sale?
KEK.
