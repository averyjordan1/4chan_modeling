Modum, first dev update the 30th this month.
HST.They will announce clients and partnerships in late December.
They said in the telegram that their partner is very well known.Also IMO could be the Australian government since they are in the voting business, so that makes sense.

Could have doubled my money last time but I held instead of selling the news.
Still just about in the green.
When it pumps take your x3 then wait for the dip to buy back in.
Syscoin is switching to PoS and enabling masternodes soon.
This will lead to a big pump.
Currently at $0.20 buy in while it's cheap!
