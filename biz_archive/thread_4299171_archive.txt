t. doesn't know anything about crypto
is this really how you crypto retards respond to criticism?

how the fuck can someone be this stupid?
lmao
I dont need to.
This thing screams SCAM more than it ever did.
Who the fuck would want to get into investing in this market right now?
crypto is the autism version of credit
Crypto will go mainstream, but I agree 99% will just fail.
Few examples that will succeed.Look at XRP, they are already working with banks and more and more banks are interested.
This will go mainstream.SYS, they got real companies lining up to be on board with them.
They will among other projects create a decentralized marketplace (no fees etc).
Besides that it creates a platform to become the silkroad 2.0.This will go mainstream.So you are delusional as a nocoiner to deny disruptive technology not to have a place in society.
