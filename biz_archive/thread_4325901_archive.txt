First of all pls dont shill hereI want to be honest with you biz,im in bch again now, yesterday bch went up to 0.7 on coinexchange and i could bite my own ass because i didnt sold then.
Still i sold at a nice 3x and felt pretty comfy thinking bitcoin will raise but right now things look exactly like yesterday.
Also the bch fork is right around the corner which would make bch pretty attractive to miners in comparision with btc at least at this moment.On the other hands this just looks too good to be true.
What do you guys think?
Did you bought the bch dip?
I bought at 0.18 and it allready went up also the order books start to look better.Dont let this be the call to buy into bch for you, i think at this time its really risky, you could become a bch bagholder or become a comfy 8x guy at this point i think its pure gambling
 No shiling here> Describes how all this shitstorm by itself shills BCHIt's going to be like last night anon, get your positions carefully.
the unconfirmed transactions almost doubled since yesterdayhttps://blockchain.info/de/unconfirmed-transactionsif this really was the point of the pumping i would say it pumps like hell tonight, but at my luck it probably goes down to 0 or something
