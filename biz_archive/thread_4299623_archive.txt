a non-crpytofaggotry thread deal with it bitches, so recently I traveled to multiple countries and I came across a bunch of unique & successful but local to that area type of businesses (e.g restaurants) and I was thinking why not copy every single thing about that in this case a small restaurant even the design and marketing strategy back home where I live in a similarly sized city and almost guarantee it's success?
is this basically the formula to lamboland?
isn't this what chinks do all the time?
also think uber and lyft, you don't need innovation to succeed
>almost guarantee it's success?TRUMP_WRONG.jpg
almostsure there are multiple variables but generally it has more chances of succeeding since it's already proven else where with a very similar targeted market
