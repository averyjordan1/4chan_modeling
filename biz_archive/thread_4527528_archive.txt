Something about fucking naked girls wearing converse turns me on.
I don't know if I'm going to make it bros :\ I am quite poor and live on my own (was homeless since 16) so saving money is problematic.
I have 5 ETH, 2K REQ , 1K Link and 1k SUB.
Next month I'll be able to buy a full BTC.
I know I'll never be a millionaire with this stack, but if I can have 100k in 2 years, I'll be able to buy a house in my town.
>mfw I'm starting to think I'm not going to make it

This is the first time I visit this board or read anything crypto related for like 4 months How do I get out of this hole?
I started trading this may and turned 500 bucks into 8k, 18 k being the peak of my portofolio and me missing out because greedy retard.
How to get back in the game?

Stop crying like a bitch your just missing out on mad gains.
Buy blocknet it's fucking undervalued and already doing atomic swaps
Sell at a loss.
Invest in btc or eth and hodl until recovered.
4528924I am not really crying, I mean I am net positive.
It is more a philosophical question of how do I achieve the trader mentality and am not emotionally attached to coins.
Is there any literature out on that, preferably on crypto in particular?
I mean I am still in the green with DGB and RDD at this point and sold half of it each at their peaks.
Both RDD at 6 sats and DGB at 90.
Also hodling LTC since 29$ and other coins.
What about HTML5 I just checked out their website and I am not even sure if its a total fuckup like when I bought it for 1 sat.
