I lost 300 usd today and felt like the worst shit ever.
It was my first "big loss" (yes I know it's not that much but I don't have much money).

You didn't spend enough time researching before trying to trade.
Crypto is so incredibly volatile, so if you aren't selling and buying again quickly before the prices move you're going to get fucked.
My brother has been trading for years and makes way more than he did as a software lead at IBM, but he occasionally has to pull an all nighter just watching the numbers for the right time to buy up more coins so he doesn't sink his profits.
