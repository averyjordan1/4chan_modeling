I really am at awe with how good /biz/ is at finding really good moon mission coins.CFD (before scam), POWR, now HST.I missed the POWR train, but I'm getting in HST.
This has tremendous potential.Why are posters here not rich yet?

HST is a legit coin.Because some people are quick to dismiss new informations before DYOR.
Glad that you believe in HST.
