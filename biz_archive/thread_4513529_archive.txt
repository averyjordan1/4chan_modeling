>still no trailing stop loss option on bittrex
whats a trailing stop loss?t.bittrexcuck
It's a stop low that rises as the price rises, but doesn't fall when the price falls.
i don't know how people are supposed to trade successfully without them desu
Have no programming skills either, so I can't make a bot that does it
You don't, thats the point.
90% of the people on this bored only lose money because they aren't using stop losses or are using shity scam exchange with no option for stop losses.
4513621so like you can set a stop loss, say 10% below market price?
and it moves up as the price moves up, but triggers at the original price if the price tanks?
needing stop losses in fucking crypto
pay a pajeet $5 to make you one
Have you seen pajeet's code?
Yeah, you can set it to whatever you want.
It's the best way to ride trends
holy shit this exists???
fuck
lmao which coin goes up that slowly?
That's probably forex.
I'm just using the pic as an example
Using stop loss in crypto is the fastest way to lose your gains.
The volatility is way too high.
You will see your stop loss hit then the price bounce right back up ten minutes later.
Now multiply that by ten when the institutional money gets in.
They will trigger your and everybody else's stops just for fun then pick up the pieces.
Over and over and over.
fucking haxxors
tfw you simply prevent this by coding with the api
Yes I know how to write a script that will happily adjust a conditional sell upward.
That changes nothing I wrote.
Crypto swings too wildly to effectively use stop losses.
You will lose your money that way.
