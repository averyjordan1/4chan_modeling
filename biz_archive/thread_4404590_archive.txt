Give me a quick rundown on vertcoin.
Why do some of you say it will take btcs spot over any other alt?
It won't unless super whales buy up 95% of the supply at a cheap price then pump it to hell.Technological superiority to BTC as a currency-only doesn't matter for adoption.
It's also still a POW coin and POW coins have political consolidation problems even when there is no asics for them (mining farms and pool owners).
mostly because of its catchy name.who WOULDN'T want to spend vertcoins?
Good tech and ASIC resistant, dedicated devs and truely a people's coin.
Its really Litecoin 2.0 but actually decentralized as in no major miningcorp can take over
Quite good nameCommited dev team with solid ideasASIC resistant (maybe not a good thing if you want to run decent traffic)Overall not a shitcoin, it aint cheap no more tho
