LINK, seriously
What is the best coin to hold for 1-2 yearsbitcoin or monero.
REQ and CFD, seriously
Request
Link for small holds (like $1000) that might moon 100xBTC and BCH for large consistent returns ($10000+)

Probably REQ.
You'll feel more comfortable with REQ because they're definitely better at communication than the LINK team.

I haven't heard too much about Syscoin - does it have much potential?
BQX - jesus christ LINK is about to be a dead coin with a lot of pissed off people, you just bag hold if you buy and you sell at a loss, it's only mooning if it gets Pumped.BQX has a working product that has the potential to be the Crypto every person in the world uses, with a 200mill total supply.
This coin is going to be at LTC prices by EOY2018 and ETH prices by EOY2020, 1,000 will get you about 800 give or take, that's going to be enough in 3 / 4 years for 200k+Next pick is BCPT, same total supply, it's a lending coin with a big name behind it (BlockMason) is going to be a $5/10 by EOY2018 and is only .30 now on a dip.

don't blow it.
