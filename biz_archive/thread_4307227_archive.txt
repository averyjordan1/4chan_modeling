I have 2 spare BTC and 25 BCH.
What should I do?
Dump the BTC into BCH.
Sell BCH before it crashes, it's already ranging without legs.
THIS
shouldnt i hedge?
Dump the BCH into BTC if you like money.
thanks pajeetnow leave
There's only one answer.
All in Link.
You know in your heart it's that needs to be done.
Yes, hedge.
BCH is solid but hedging is important if you don't want to sink.
You just simply cannot be correct every bet, you know?
Not anticipating the flippening
do you think my current holdings are enough to hedge against each other?
i was thinking about selling a little more bch
all in Ethereum.
bitcoin is old news
BCH, btchs love bch
Go fuck yourself you fucking retard.
Make a series of poor trades to bring you down to net worth zero, because you have no idea what you're doing, and buy high, sell low everytime.
Or you could just hold on to them like an adult for the next five years, you retard.
duly noted.
will hold.
thanks anon
Sell all your BCH for BTC.Then sell all your BTC for LINK.This is the only surefire way to make a profit, anything else would be taking a huge risk.
keep one buttcoin, trade in the other for bch
Typically I would say yes but BTC is dead, massive amounts of money is moving to BCH and getting redpilled at the same time.
Even if BTC somehow recovers it has lost hegemony over the crypto market.
BCH will continue its rise because it quite literally has no growth roadblocks for the foreseeable future, and transaction costs will remain extremely cheap.BTC won't survive much longer.
