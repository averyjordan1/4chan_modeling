Hey sir, i do not appreciate your tone.
Please do your research before shitposting.
Refer to image and you will understand that iâ€™m talking about price in BTC.

It's currently at 82% of ICO price.
Signed, A slightly salty bagholderThat said, I still think its a good buy for long-term gains.
I doubt with the talent on board that the exchange won't materialize and be widely used.
This is the complete opposite of the doomed fly-by-night crap that dominates new token listings.

I mean I told you guys for weeks this shit is pointless as long as 0x and Kyber exist
I agree, but 0x and Kyber don't have Lubin and Novogratz with them.
AST probably won't be a better product, but it will be more hyped, has more money behind it and more recognizable names.

It's market cap is 1/3 that of other decentralized exchanges, and the beta is coming out this quarter.
The team is stacked beyond belief, (Novogratz, Lubin, _someone who previously held the position of the chief scientist of the Israeli Government for christ's sake_, AND it's a consensys backed app (Joseph Lubin's company, a VC co. with the purpose of creating the ethereum ecosystem) It's basically the official ethereum exchange.
(not technically, but it's as close to an official ethereum app as anything is going to get) 1/3 of other decentralized exchanges, has a working beta open to token holders before any of the other decentralized exchange tokens that have 3x the market cap = AST will AT LEAST 3x before the end of Q4.
wow pajeet if you really believe that i have a street to sell you.
lol.
