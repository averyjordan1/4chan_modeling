This is a dying meme, surrender now OP.
Very lazy shilling, OP.
I'm heavily in Ark but stop posting this shit

And sorry , but canâ€™t stop.
I see it as my duty to educate /biz/ til everybody realizes the once in a lifetime opportunities that come with an investment in ark.Additionally, the delegates run by Chang and Moon Man are the perfect example of how awesome the ark community is providing further foundations for a bright future of the ark ecosystem.Maybe I will stop by the time ark is at least at 50$.Buy now, thank me 12 months from now.
It's not shilling, it's a warning.
