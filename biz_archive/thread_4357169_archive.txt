This coin has a partnership with Origin, which is Australia's largest energy provider.Not "will have", DOES have a partnership.This coin is the first of it's kind in that it has real world use in the public sector.
It's projected to increase 15-20x.
-20x with a marketcap of 100mil, this is what desperation and delusion looks like.Going to be hilarious when it dumps after the AMA and you cry yourself to sleep.
