*BCH quietly goes up as BTC also goes up*
BCH quietly goes upbitch where?
no where
under your bed, BCH is the boogeyman.
cashies are delusionalthey see the price of their shitcoin tanking in comparison to bitcoin and somehow their brain spins it to a "positive"
not just delusional--psychotic.
they will bring the whole of crypto down on you just to prove a point.
The absolute state of cashies....
44489434448960Well it was $1230ish when BTC was starting to rise, when BTC breached the $8000 barrier, BCH breached $1200.
Right now it's hovering around $1280 as BTC fell to $7960.So I would say yes, BCH rose when BTC rose.
If BTC goes to 10k, BCH will be over $2k.
That would be a 100% gain over BTC's 20% gain.
Right now it's hovering around $1280.... sweetie.... you need some rest.
Blatant lying has become trendy around here lately I've noticed.
Deluded trashies, lmao.
Wow that was a typo, I meant to put in $1180, and it still is in that range btw.
