Considering the rise of crypto-currency, is gold still worth investing in?
I like having tangible assets, but I'm torn between it and crypto.
It's probably safer
If an emp or cyberwar wipes out all global electronics then Bitcoin will be worthless.
it depends on what you're investing in it for.
if you want to make even 10% returns on it you'll be waiting a few years.
if you want it in case of economic collapse or whatever bullshit good luck not getting murdered for it

Brb, shopping for coins.
rule of thumb spend whatever you spent on gold spend on ammo
its really not as dramatic as all the fallout gamers think.
gold has gone up in value for thousands of years.
on any long dated chart it goes up.
keep some gold and silver and over time it will go up in value.
crypto is also good for massive gains/losses and shorter timelengths, but gold and silver are proven long holds.
crypto may or may not make you wealthy, gold will make your children wealthy
