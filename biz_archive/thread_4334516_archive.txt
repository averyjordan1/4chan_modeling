Anyone else starting to feel like there's going to be a nice little run on Digibyte soon?
Maybe not this year, but say in 3 months we might see a few hundred sats increase if you buy now where it is modestly low.Look at the History, every so often we see a jump of 50 sats or so, and that's not even mentioning that it recently got listed on Kucoin.Will we see its time in the sun again soon?
