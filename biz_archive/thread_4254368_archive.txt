When Howard Stern dies, will SiriusXM survive?
who
Satellite is dead and that old Pelican is gonna be judging talent shows for the rest of his life.
Who the fuck has listened to Howard in the last 10 years?
Also this ship was sunk as soon as they fired Anthony Cumia.
Podcasts killed radio.
Probably most of the people who subscribe don't subscribe for the talk stations.
I heard there were high level talks between Nexus (NXS) and SiriusXMSomething about blockchain and Howard Stern
Spotify and other services like that.
Also YouTube Red even.
Make a playlist of music from all over the site, shuffle, and go.
There's no reason to have satellite radio.
Never heard of him
why, is he dying?
I've had Sirius for the last 5 years or so.
I don't give a shit about Howard Stern, and I don't understand how he manages to get $80million a year off these guys but good for him.
I use it for music 70% and news 30%I have to switch back to am/fm in my work truck and god that shit is unbearable.
Very much worth the money.
It's only $25 for 5 months if you know how to jew them.I also have YouTubeRed, you can't compare the two as apples to apples.
