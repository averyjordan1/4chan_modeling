wen't all in on XVG like 2 hours ago.. it feels like my anus is bleeding WTF why did I do this
Because you needed to learn that you never put all your eggs in the same basket.Going all in is retarded.
Even when you're 100% sure.
Because something's always going to go wrong.
buy monero
it always worked until now
You shouldn't have bought any, let alone go all in.
how can anyone fall for the pathetic pajeetcoin that is xvg is absolutely fucking beyond me.
