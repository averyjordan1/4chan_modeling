How come its always the coin no one talks about on this board, that actually moons.link, neo, all the other obsessively shilled shitcoins are gonna do nothing while IOTA and stuff no one here ever talks about will change the game forever.This fucking coin literally has 0 fees.
I just send 4000 IOTA and in 10 min the receiving address got 4000.0 iota, nothing deducted.
genius
Because it's pol.
They want to shill a new coin to get 2x gains then hand the bags over.
IOTA is a long term play but has room for exponential growth over the next few years.
If that was the case no one would be talking about link because it already hit 50 cents.
I forgot to mention, its a cycle.
New bag holders shill to hopefully minimize their loss or break even.
Current shilling of Link is from bagholders.
Even though I still feel like if some of the link promises come true it should moon again.
Because /pol/ is slowly realizing that everyone is just a shittier version of a jew.
WE WUZ IOTA MARINES
IOTA has been shilled here so hard, holy shit.
Where were you?
Neo is a good coin with a bright future.
