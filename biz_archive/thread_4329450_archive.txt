Starting with DGB.
eth
BTC
Not DGB
fun fact: shitcoins that are avoided like the plague are often the greatest ones to play for profits as most people will be afraid to get in until they see it take off after they sold too earlydgb though probably not
some of you are alright.
don't hold BTC tomorrow.

BTC, LTC
DGB will be trading 3x its ATH within 3 years.
3 years is not that long to wait for 100x gains.
I agree there are others more profitable- but nothing as safe as DGB at its current price or state.
DGB is a legit blockchain, second longest, with none of the drama that others offer.
I'm buying a couple BTC worth now.
