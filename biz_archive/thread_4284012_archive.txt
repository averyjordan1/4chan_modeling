Partnership with Paypal coming up.Last chance , to buy it at a bargain.https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/09/paypal-money-pools/
I'm already all in.
A few days ago I already called some clients to pay up so I could dump more money into it.
But I haven't got the money yet.
It's not the same logo though as Stellar just simiiar, fuck Paypal for playing us
Source?
Or just the XLM looking logo on the PayPal app?

They look amazingly similar no?
The partnership ain't solidified amigo, so if they use Stellar's logo prior then they'd possibly be liable to XLM, especially if the partnership never happened.
Interesting.
Yes, very similar.
But I figured you either use the logo or you don't.
It's weird that the logo is 99% the same.
I'm holding XLM either way.
Stellar could sue PayPal if they use their logo without permission.
Therefore, it may be a partnership.
fuck paypal
who cares, if true that's great news for stellar, which is a kick ass project btw
It's not their logo, the rocket is too skinny and looks nothing like Stellar's logo, it's a pretty common symbol used in the tech world.I wouldn't worry about Paypal, there is going to be enough money floating into Stellar soon enough next year with the South Pacific banks that it will be Paypal who should be scared of Stellar.
>I figured you either use the logo or you don't.Maybe it’s a rebranding he eh he he
Agreed.
It's the strongest partnership that any crypto currently has.
This thing is trading for 3 pennies each.
I'm just glad I got in when I did.
PayPal rep thanks person for his feedbackPARTNERSHIP CONFIRMED
Im a big believer in Stellar.
But I don’t see PayPal happening.
IBM announced a partnership with Zelle bout same time as the Stellar partnership.
Zelle is a paypal competitor that works with all kinds of banks.Also, JP Morgan acquired WePay.
What I could see happening is a Zelle/WePay/Stellar combo.Check out Jesse Lund’s comments on Twitter about the WePay acquisition where he says something more exciting planned for payments.
nd link from 2014
lol back in 2014 all these stupid dumb rumors went around of a Zetacoin partnership with Safaricom, and a few times Safaricom tweeted back generic PR statements like "we thank you for your interest and always keep an open mind yayadayada" and pajeets used this as an excuse to shill for weeks.
Then finally Safaricom dropped the bomb one day in a tweet after being harassed endlessly "there is no partnership" and that was the end.
Cool story anon.
IBM confirmed.
All that matters.
Epic
I have 600.

I love how Paypal did not deny it
He forgot two zeros, minimum.
