Just noticed today
it's actually a good fucking coin and solid idea just read up about it.
In the future we'll be using TRX in all games and tip eachother online for funny memes with TRX.
worst part is, you cant even sell this shit
4356244They just give some to everyone?
Was gonna ask the same thing, woke up to this today, found some lying around in my binance account...Anybody know if this was on purpose??
https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002742352Gotto buy more of it to sell it, but it looks decent and seems to have been unfairly dumped.
Look up "justin sun forbes".
I think you'll be pretty impressed.
This coin could actually go somewhere.
