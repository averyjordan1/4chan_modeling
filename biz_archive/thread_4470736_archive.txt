Both BCH and BTC seem to be gradually increasing, this happened before the huge pump that took BCH up to 3k but before that it was in a stealth phase where it didn't care what BTC did.1k is the new floor, and it's descending wedge just might reverse if it keeps up its new floor for at least a week we may be in the midst of another run that may take it higher than its current ATH.Start accumulating.
Th bchbtc downtrend broke down recently which leads me to the same conclusion
