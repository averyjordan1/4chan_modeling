This guy is one of the biggest scammers on youtub
So Mark Cuban with 5% of his 2bil portfolio and Mike Novogratz with 20% of his portfolio in crypto is a joke?
Did you watch the video?
He's trying to explain why normies SHOULD invest in bitcoin.
Check out his channel, his always shilling for new ICOs and shiet
I think you should do the other way: explain to people why fiat is a bad investment.
You really only lose when keeping assets in fiat.
I've talked to some normies, but they vehemently defend their monopoly money.
Cool dude.
A bunch of people at my work know about bitcoin.
Besides myself, the only guy to own any is some dude who bought a round number to buy some darkweb software a couple years ago and had a few bits left over.
Everyone thinks they've missed the boat.
