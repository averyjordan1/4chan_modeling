cant wait to watch all these geezers lose because of complacency,The market decides what works not your structured framework for how everything has worked during your lifetime.Bitcoing isnt going to fuckin stop blowing up because a bunch of old money investors tell people bitcoin is going to fail and thats its a bubble.
Theres already too many people figuring this out, technology is about to take these people from hero to zero in the blink of an eye.meanwhile the smart people are accumulating the currency of the future and getting ready to start the real race.
Nah, Bitcoin is never going to be a main currency.
Gold and silver are going to become relevant again and Bitcoin and all the altcoins will fade away.
No one buys anything except for drugs with BTC.
That feeling when you step out of a time machine to 2010
