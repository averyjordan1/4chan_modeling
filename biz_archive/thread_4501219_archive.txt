Backed by InMotion Ventures (Jaguar Land Rover), DOVU is a ubiquitous cryptocurrency for enabling and rewarding all modes of transport, connecting the world.i did my research ... it will stay under the radar ... but 10x in februar 2018!
>it will stay under the radar Then please stop talking about it so it stays that way.
by the way ... the last company this guy brought to the world was a billion dollar company ...
;) ... of course i want ppl to jump on it ... for faster growth
faster growthOnly in the short term.
Doesn't matter long term.
The only reason for shilling it now is if you want to sell it in the short term.
Their Head of Blockchain development is a graphic designer.
No experienced blockchain dev capability at all.
What could possibly go wrong?All they have is an idea and reduced rate desk space in an incubator part funded by Jaguar.
They are years away from having a product
thats not true ... the already have big partnerships and more than an idea ... but a lot of projects have 50 mio marketcap and have just an idea, your right ;) dovu is at 4 mio ...
Dovu, Our partners:Inmotion (its a startup hub for automative industry.
Reduced rate desk space - cool)Creative England (helps fund the startup hub - cool)TokenData - Helps trade the tokens that currently aren't worth anything - coolYeh thats your ticket to the moon right there.
Along with your head of blockchain that can draw some nice pictures.
dovu will not be a top10, kid ... you dont need a guy like vitalik for devoloping an app on top of ethereum for the mobility sector ... you need the idea and the connections to the companies ... just buy bitcoin if your not able to imagine this ... remember me when dovo is at 16 mio in december ;)
