Your round eye ally
buy bitcoin cash>no, don't listen to him, bitcoin gold is the way to go>no no no, only bitcoin>fuck you guys, bitcoin silver only!you fuckers will destroy this market for good and scare every normie/investor away
Chink just seems so derogatory.
I prefer fish-headed sewer dragon desu senpai
And you profited
The BTG Futures pump occuring just before the BTG launch.
This will be bloody.
Everybody was intending to sell BTG.
The pump happened only for it to have some value when the dump happens.
fuck the normies
I agree, that's why I want them inthe normies provide easy money for us,but if you prefer to play the rigged game against armies of coordinated whales then good luck making any money
Doesn't mean you can't take advantage of it.
I bought in at $90 per coin.
Where do you guys think this will top at?
Holy fuck $450 at Binance
