This weekend is boring.
I'm hoping BTC stays at this price forever so alts can have a chance at replacing it desu.
x in 1 year What did you expect huh?
ITS MOONING GUYS BUY BUY BUY 9K HERE WE COOOOME
+100 in 20 minuteswhats your problem?
didnt you buy low?
alts replacing anything
One day something is going to replace BTC as the king, but high chances are that thing doesn't even exist yet.
It certainly won't be alts that are just slightly better BTC
With bitcoin having less and less volatility as time goes on (outside of short and specific timeframes), it begins to make more sense to trade it with leverage like you would normal forex.
You can do it on GDAX or use derivatives on an exchange like BitMEX but I don't recommend bucket shops like Plus500, for some reason you Aussie scum seem to have all been roped into it.
News is always quite predictable to trade, so just be patient and remember that we're still in a bull market and people will mostly still interpret bullish TA as buying time until something really bad happens.
Don't open a short position for more than 30 minutes.
You can have two accounts on this website to take multiple positions on the same contract if you feel uncertain but know volatility is coming, but often times it's better to just sit it out until you feel more sure.https://www.bitmex.com/register/eY1A09
