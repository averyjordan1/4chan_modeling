Is biz a good representation of the crypto-community?
All i see here are shills, pump/dump icos, and whale hype so you can get rich quick.. do you guys care about cryptocurrency and blockchain??
How will crypto thrive when it is already viewed negatively to normies?
Invest in the innovation and tech so it can develop or the whales are gonna milk this shit, cash out, and blow this bubble so either these cryptos will be replaced by blockchains used by companies or drastically corrected in price
