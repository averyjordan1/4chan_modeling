PBC picks POWR???
They picked DASH you fucking nog

Same except I bought back in during that massive dip at the bottom so kind of stressing it will keep going down when PBC comes out and it's not POWR.
Oh well, still up quite a bit in the big scheme of things.Yeah, 6 months ago.
Pajeets everywhere today.
Dash is the pick though, he picked it again
Mnuchin's wife is so freaking hotin that evil soulless gold-digger sorta way
Yeah, I saw.
Oh well.
It will either creep back up now or creep back down.
Depends on how much of the hype that PBC P&D destroyed.
Probably a lot of it.
Meh.
Stil made a bit on it but I would rather sell them a bit higher and keep some POWR to hold long term.
I would have to cash 80% of it out now to break even which sucks.
Going to take the risk though as I have 20% to play with.
I would prob sell it now tho if i didn't have the 20% to hold as I want to buy back into something else.
I'll leave it till morning tho.
It will prob be $1 EOY either way maybe.
Or die forgotten for 6 months thanks to the chink P&D.
It depends on Dev progress and news now.
If they can get a grid setup and POWR working (big if) then this will easily be $2-3 but who knows when that will happen.
