That's it.
I finally battled my laziness and removed everything I had on Kraken to wallets and other exchanges.
The levels of shittiness on this pathetic excuse of an exchange are just not fathomable.
Literally every 2 day old pre-alpha chink exchange is superior in everything.
It already cost me thousands over the last weeks.>highest fees>slowest reaction times>shittiest interface and design>literally have to repeat commands 30 times when trying to make or cancel orders>never responding and always down in high stress times>all these things going on for weeks nowHow the fuck can you call yourself an exhange WHEN YOU FUCKING CAN'T MAKE OR CANCEL ORDERS WITHOUT REPEATING THEM 50 TIMES FOR WEEKS NOW??
Just wondering how this exchange isn't bankrupt yet.
Anyway, stay way.
Same here bretheren, done with them.
Any European exchange worth looking at?
Gay ass (((anglo)))I can always tell by the faggy sperg.
Yea OP, fuck kraken!
I pulled out my funds after the bcc dump that day, I could have made a few hundred bucks but thanks to kraken only made like 50 or something.
Crap exchange
But just yesterday I was told to use Kraken by /biz/.
Kraken is my favorite exchange for cashing out
Kraken lag + my idoicy lost me 1.77 BCC I sold over and over at 1,200 (bought in at 8) but recieved 5 error messages.
When I checked my account later in the day, the sale had gone through.... so I panic bought at 1,400... all my gains (~3,000) from this weekend lost in a few hours.
FUCK YOU KRAKEN
