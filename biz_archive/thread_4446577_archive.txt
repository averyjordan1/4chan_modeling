Is this going to die?
Dark web markets should start to use it
Why use a shitcoin when they have monero
b-but its better than moner
I hope not.
Its the only way I'm gonna get a return on my puny $100 capital
anything is better than moneroi'd buy cp with bitcoin over monero any day of the week, fuck that ip tracking shit
ODN will kill it off for good
not sure, looks ok desu, it never held above 0.6c for long.
of course price in sats is down, but it could go either way from here.
Honestly I dumped this shit.Held $400 worth of this since June when it was 70ish sats hoping it would 3-4x.
Got greedy and didn't sell when it was 140-170 for about a week.
Ended up dumping at 110 for 1.5x.They've been nothing but disappointing - wraith protocol delayed so many times with the latest shit show being a massive hype up only to be told the beta was ALMOST done.This MAY blow up in the next year but honestly I wouldn't count on it at this point.
The team has shown zero reason to believe in them.
You would have made 2-3x putting into BTC, or catching the PnD of the week.
Biggest shitcoin ever
gets arrested for cp>provable beyond a doubt that you bought it because of the public fucking ledger>reeeee all the way to the injection chamber about how your IP wasn't tracked so it wasnt youhahahaahha kill youself vergin
"monero tracks IPs" is a clear retard alert btwif you knew anything about monero or the internet in general you'd know this not an issue
