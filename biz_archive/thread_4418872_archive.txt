what the fuck is this bullshit
Remember when Bittrex was the least scammy exchange?
Seems like the market is offline due to routine maintenance.
all exchanges are dogshit right when you need themim honestly sick of them, there's no quality for a multibillion dollar market
Seems legit.
I had a buy ready for 470K but the fucker was offline... came back 490K ...FUCK.
Iâ€™m not fomoing this anymore.
Have fun lads...
H-hey thats my thread please buy decred...
