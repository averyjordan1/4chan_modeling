Monero is like getting paid to sit at a front row seat to watch the BTC - BCH thing unfold
yeah, the graph looks beautiful and the gain are loyal.
kudos to the /biz/ people who shilled this coin yesterday.
I got meself 7 of these magnificent hedge coins and im not complainin
Bought a little yesterday.
Want to buy more, but i dont wanna buy after such nice gains.
Should i wait for a dip or just go for it
probably pulls back a little, but all in all i think you should go for it, it will probably be at 1-2k in a year
