check the price before buy something
lel siacoin
you ain't comfy if you bought this at 800 sats bro
maybe I wouldn't be but I have the strongest hands
Rigor mortis perhaps.
It's not as good as if you were holding since 50,200 or 400.
You chose terrible time to enter Sia.
BUT.
Instead of 4x you might make 2x or so.Don't sell with loss.
Sia has very bright future ahead.It's not adopted yet and I can explain to you why it will be.
To be fair, it sounded promising at ATH, then when their BIG announcement was a mining rig everyone was disappointed and since then no good news followed
are you the famous sia millionaire?
Did you try reading about how the coin itself works?For example, the fact that it's highly inflationary?
LMAO.
F.
>Weak handed faggots If you held sia since june you wouldnt be making this thread, you would be tying the noose

By the way here is same graph but with bitcoin.Why aren't you saying bitcoin is highly inflationary, huh?
