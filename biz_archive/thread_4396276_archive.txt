Does anyone else exclusively trade BTC/ETH for comfy 99% confidence gains?i dont see gambling on alts for 20% worth missing out on 5% gains when theyre basically a sure thing.
Are you fucking kidding me?
5% is just not enough for all the time I put into my trading
For comfy gains I have ETFs churning out steady cash in tax-free accounts.
Crypto can never be truly comfy because there are lots of existential risks, mainly governments banning or regulating them.
Eth and BTC are big holdings of mine but having high-risk high-reward coins is fine too if crypto is a small % of our total worth.
Iâ€™m 90% BTC+ETH, and a few shitcoins in my portfolio permeating the air with a heinous fecal stench.
One of them will pop off, probably GNT.
