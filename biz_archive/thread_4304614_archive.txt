Every time I look at my portfolio I consider suicide.
Is this normal?
Yes.
I started with about $150 in BTC, rode the SIGT pump to $800 but lost a lot of it because Craptopia is a terrible exchange and froze when SIGT crashed.
As for my loss just on investments, it's been about $100.
My only good gains were Zen Cash and Verge.
BCH explodes for no apparent reason, too late to buy.
I'm just sitting on my Verge, some XLM, and some cheap as fuck shit coins I got on Craptopia for the fuck of it in case they someday moon.
Nothing makes sense in crypto.
It's even worse than gambling, because it's manipulated.
Regular people can play Rothschild with this shit.
same.
up by 25% yesterday and now everything has returned to what I put in to it
