serious EOY price discussion thread - go.
zero dollars
$5 EOY 2017
a conservative, but probably correct, estimate.
0Genocide LINK faggots and their annoying threads.
-70 cents.
90 cents
Honestly I'd be more than happy with $1 at this point.
I think even £5 is deluded, 50 cents is more realistic.Only 7 weeks left til EOY now.

4286448i thought this was a serious EOY price discussion, not delusional wish thinking, go kysconvervative guess - 30-35 centsoptimistic - 40-45 cents
If the trend continues 30 or 40 cents.
If we get new exchanges like Kraken or GDAX and news like Swift formally stating their use of Chainlink then $4 or $5 easy.
I don't see this actually taking off until mid next year though.
a half eaten bologna sandwich
 cents
correct.
this is for serious LINK price discussion only.
which is why any estimate below $1 is not allowed here.
mixing $ and £I'm a britfag and this is too retarded for even me
If this post ends with even $.45If odds $.25If dubs $57
are there even any hardware wallets like ledger nano that support LINK?
NoI hold link too but saying it will reach 1 dollar anytime soon is not even optimistic, it's just retarded
I think you can use myetherwallet with ledger
last 3 digits of this post
i hate you
LINK is ERC20.
So both Trezor and Ledger can be used in conjunction with MyEtherWallet.
Obvious typo, faggot.
*$5
at this rate, EOY maybe 40-50 cents.Hopefully 10x+ by summer 2018.
