I feel like I'm not going to make it with crypto.
What should my plan B be?
No wagecucking or memes like dropshipping please
Get a job, buy Bitcoin, get a girlfriend, wait 5 years, sell Bitcoin.
Invest in shit going on at that time.
>Make it anon>Stop looking for advice from memes
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE I SAID NO WAGECUKING
plan B would be silver
Crypto should always be plan B if you have the skills to make $Make $ and throw 1-2 grand a month into crypto before you know it you'll have 100k, and if all crypto dies you're still making fat stacks at your job.
Just HODL safe long term coins and invest in a 401k like a sane individual.
You'll develop anxiety and suicidal feelings day trading as you make and then lose more than you earn in your wagecuck job in the matter of weeks.
Also DO NOT WATCH YOUR PORTFOLIO EVERY OTHER MINUTE.
How much $ did you put in?
This.
I'm not throwing money earned at my job into crypto anymore, I put $3k in to start and don't spend my crypto.
I live off my job.
Crypto is a hobby.
A hobby that if I quit now would net me $40,000.00
Death is always an option.
I have no idea of what your current situation is, but if you have at least a couple thousands invested I may have a solution for you
Invest in a high risk high reward coin.
Chainlink seems pretty obvious if you want to quit wagecucking next year.
K. I'm down 23% right now.
Poor NEETfag here
How old are you?
