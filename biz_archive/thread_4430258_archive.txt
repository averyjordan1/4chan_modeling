I've been warning you guys the last couple of days to get in NEO.
Why aren't you taking out a loan to get in on this moon mission?
Are you really going to wait until it's 0.008 on Monday to FOMO in?
that doesn't sound like the you i remember.
rsi is about to tip over into oversold, wait about 10 minutes and buy the fuck in.
the next run up will be around 63-6400 (equivalent of $49) where people will start taking profits to beat the bots who will take profits at $50.
just buy the fuck in when it's oversold and wait.
it's that easy.
