Is it me or bitcoin cash or any fork can't be "the new bitcoin" if they don't replace it when they come out ?When every btc holder still has his duplicate, they could consider both coins the same, and keep the new better one that is accepted, but when it's been traded for days, weeks or months it's just another alt.Many coins would do the job better than BCC or BCH or even S2X.Also bonus question, why do people spend energy and time shilling bch when it had a 24h volume of fucking 4 billions $ ?
It does literally nothing, even if those pajeet posts made 100 people here buy it would change literally nothing.
Bonus question answer: Volume is fake and gay.
To use this parameter is mental retardness on a whole new level.
Ghost exchanges, Bots etc etc are just manipulating These numbers.
I also don't get the mentality of people saying that BCH will be the new BTC.It can't happen, it's too late.They're either lying, or complete idiots
you dont look at volume to determine anything you dumbfuck.all you have to do is look at the coinmarketcap and see that billions of dollars are leaving BTC and billions of dollars are entering BCH
That's not how it works though, the marketcap is only last transaction price x circulating supply.It bitcoin trade sideways for 1 month but people buy alts meanwhile, the marketcap of bitcoin will stay the same and alts will go up.The total marketcap will go up without new money.
Why would you reply to this shit?
