zap.store's ZAP token looks like a great buyholding for a moon late this year
i agree, holding 200k currently feeling comfy
Yeah zap store could even host LINK oracles if they aren't vaporware that is.
Yeah it seems like they are shilling more than actually doing anything productive but I could see a partnership with ZAP if they do release a working product
>not holding ZAPlol stay poor I've heard that this will be major
So you heard huh?
yeah there will be some major news coming soon on it, just buy it at 15 cents while you still can... remember this token is still nascent, nowhere to go but up!
I'm going all in!!!
we will see what happens /biz/
