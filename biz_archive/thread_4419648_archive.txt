So what exactly was going through BCash idiots minds who bought at $2500?
Did they not see the parabolic bubble?
Did they think it would just get infinite growth?
Obligatory terrified corecuck thread #4465576

People are only dumb after the fact.BTC charts are pretty fucking parabolic right now in day to day timeframes...
The flippening was presently occuring and it did happen until the exchanges got DDOSed delaying and setting back the price with the market panic selling trying to take profits from BTC.But that was just the beginning, if you think those "idiots" that bought at $2500 bought high you are severely mistaken that wasn't even the tip of the iceberg.
Miners are transitioning to the superior and updated Bitcoin, we will see higher ATH's than what Bitcoin ever accomplished next year - screencap this.
lol you actually believe there was a legit growth when 90% of the volume was in a random korean exchangebch people are so retarded.
keep guzzling that roger ver semen you little bitch
Really though?
