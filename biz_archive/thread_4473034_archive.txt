With a team member named Pajeet, you never know.There used to be regular posts on here where people were trying to make discords to create scamcoins.
Most of their attempts were just bad though like TeaToken or FATCoin.
Maybe one of them finally had intelligent people on their discord.
If thats the case though, they should have just made a normal project.The thing that baffles me about Confido is that its a simple app, anyone could make it.
Where is J when we need him.
I thought that was a possibility since the ICO.
Too many similarities to the Avalon scam that was shilled here relentlessly.What I don't understand is why they exit scammed in such a high profile way.
It would've been smarter to just abandon the project and let it slowly die like most shitcoins.Instead tokenlot got the FBI involved and now they'll always be looking over their shoulder if they live somewhere that has an extradition treaty with the US.
