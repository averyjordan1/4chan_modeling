RIPIO MOONING
RCN MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bought in at 2000please go up
I WAS ABOUT TO BUY SOME YESTERDAY AND I HESITATED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
exit all altsBCH is mooningsoon BTC will start to nosediveand alts will get butchered.
mooning with 500 btc vol.
fuck outta here shill.
I use ripio to buy bitcoin, why is there nothing on the token in the page?
Are we sure its related?
are you in argentina?
Yeh
how's it like over there in terms of crypto awareness/adoption?
Normies ask about it from time to time when they see the clickbait articles about it, i dont really see major adoption coming until BTC dies, 10 dollar fees is really a big barrier
do you know anyone that has ever used RCN for a loan?
No, not really.
Predatory paycheck loans are a big business here tho.
well if it's not catching on in it's home country, how the shit is this token going to be of any value.
it's good to get intel from someone like you.
thanks for the info.
stop calling small rises mooning.
FFS.
Well this whole thing is still very much in early stages, crypto in general i mean, we still have to survive the upcoming regulation hell.
But meanwhile timing the pump waves is easy profit
This, 25% in 3 days is just a healthy raise.
irrelevant.
it's going to get wiped out either tomorrow or on the 25th.
this dragonslayer bullshit is true.
BCH is already 40% up.
MAD FOMO tomorrow, Americans will be munching on turkey all day, no one will be trading while Korea will pump the hell out of BCH, the timing is excellent
Good shilling on RCN here, I expect it to 15-20 cents by next week and 80 cents by EOY
