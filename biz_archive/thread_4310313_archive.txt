Is bitcoin going to 4900 in 6 days?
if it goes under 6k expect a massive dump the likes of which havent been seen since the one i took on your dad's chest
It may, but more than likely it will not.
$10K by EOY is not a meme.
You forget BTC is king, and always will be.
No matter how hard the chinks try to convince you otherwise.
3500 by end of december.eth to 1000screen cap this
It's not even the chinks.
It's literally a bunch of Koreans wash trading.
If anything gets governments to bring down the hammer on crypto it'll be shit like this.
The thing is there will be no flippening.
If bitcoin cash takes over crypto is pretty much dead in the water.
7 years of branding and institutional+normie money and trust will be gone and this whole thing will be sub 1k for years.
I havent had any BTC since it hit 5K ath and dropped back down.. sold out and haven't been in the crypto world in a bit.. Would be nice to see it back under 5K so I can buy back in

It will be the death of crypto but not BCC.
Did you really think these bullshit tokens had any value?
Why the fuck would a token which tracks packages or human resource allocations be worth anything?
This was predictable
I'm sensing you missed out on the Confido ICO
I hope so.
I will buy before the inevitable 10k rise in a few weeks/months.
6 daysget youre buy orders set now, lad
Lol, you sound like a brainwashed cultist.
those are the chinks, chinks cant use their own currency to buy BTC
Normies are too stupid to realize the difference.Weak FUD kike
