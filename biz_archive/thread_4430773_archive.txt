It's almost like you want to have the most boring port on the planet.Ripple is probably a good lifetime hold because gotta be the most boring coin to trade....
1k us literraly nothing, had 10x that amount and it's done nothing.
Buy a real coin unless you want to hold for over a year for 2x at best
Just wait for decemberWANCHAIN WILL CRUSH THEM ALL.
XLM will start being used by banks Q4 2017 Q1 2018.
Just to let you know.
People want instant profit, that's sad.
Knowing that they usually buy at ATH because they didn't hold their coins.
I've got 40,000 XRP ...
When the Federal Reserve announces they are going to use it its going to cause the real flippening and all the fudders will be shitting their pants in a FOMO rush
