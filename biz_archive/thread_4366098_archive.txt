I started trading on Binance yesterday but I don't like the fact that I can't simply trade back into and hold my fiat on the exchange.
Wtf do I hold in my account In between trades?
Btc and eth are more volatile than my liking.

Tether.
Tether might turn into shit any day now.
no stop losses is the worst they need to add it asap.

Binance sucks man.

Pretty cheap, especially if you hold BNB.
4366254So if I owned LTC, I would first have to trade into ETH, then ETH to USDT?
That seems unnecessarily silly.
What do you recommend then fag?
I was thinking of opening a Bitfinex account strictly due to the trading volume/liquidity they have.
You don't trade back to fiat until you can afford a lambo.
