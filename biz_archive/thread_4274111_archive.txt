I have a Cabela's Silver card, but about to get the Cabela's Black card since I'm at $23,500 so far.I always pay it off right away and just use it as a medium/proxy between my bank and my purchases.
My wife and I make $90k/year, so spending and paying off bills with the credit card can add up to $20-25k a year.
I'm only getting 1% back, but I'm exploring the idea of a 2% with an annual fee.
2% will pay off the $50-100 fee pretty easily with some extra left over compared to what 1% without a fee is currently getting me in a year.What's a good card I should look into?
My brother has a 2% Capital One Venture Black (?)
with an ~$80 annual fee on it.
I tried looking for this but it doesn't look like it's available now.My wife and I each have our credit scores above 800 and we're in our 20s.
