I have 5btc and 5bcashWill I be a millionaire by 2023?
Nope.
You called it bcash.
Sell your BCH for BTC and you’ll have nothing in a few months.
You don’t deserve these gains.
If you convert it all to Monero right now, yes
700k max
You're genuinely quite likely to possess half a million in USD if you hodl those 5 btc until 2023.If you keep the BCH that long, you might be lucky and be able to exchange it for 0.5 bitcoin gold at that point.
The BTC will mean you have 2 million dollarsThe bcash means you will owe 3 million dollars
 not putting all your holdings into BTGyou'll be a bagholder sry
