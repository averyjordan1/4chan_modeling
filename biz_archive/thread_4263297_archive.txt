The RLC pump is coming.The team will be doing an AMA this week and will be answering technical questions and questions about partnerships.
The team has been meeting with various companies including docker and intel!
This is your last opportunity to buy cheap!
Don't miss out anon!
This is like a zillion times better than golem, elastic, sonm and all those other meme tokens.
So comfy
AMA was yesterday
They did ama yesterday
HAHAHA it's such a shit coin that its own followers didnt know its AMA happned
Btw can I get the RLC holders discord invite ?
Holding 75k and ready to help marketing it since the team have no clue how to do it
Why canâ€™t you just be patient.
If you are planning on holding, what does it matter to you that the price will not go up today?
Its a solid project, and it will grow in due time - there is no need for an artificial pump...

Happy about every single RLC token in my portfolio.
IEXEC delivers fundamentals.
It is actually not the biggest green flag you can have when every other project pumps mad and recovers losses on the big alt recovery days and iExec does literally nothing, not to say it looks a bit fishy.
