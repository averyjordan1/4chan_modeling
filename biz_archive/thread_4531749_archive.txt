Anyone else in on this?
Can we get some basic information on the token sale straightened out?
Bump
> Easy 3-5x on this coin> Won't get dumped by presale buyers (they have option to lock token, 3 months for extra 5% or 6 months for extra 10%) or sell back to wabi team at 8.5 usd if I'm not mistaken so those who did not get into presale won't get dumped (well unless price does stays at 25 cent for 3 months lol)> already have working product> those fudding probably did not get into the ico whitelist so go kys
I got in, I'm just wondering about the individual cap limit, what address we send ETH to, what hour the sale starts etc...
Fudding I believe comes from the long-term of the project, short-term will be very profitable but as for the project they will need a serious cash injection to be able to work with multi billion dollar companies.
I wouldn't hold these coins longer than a few months.
Yeah don't plan on it.
Maybe 6/7 weeks max.
Wish I got in on the PreICO... Fucking 8.5X right off the bat.
Why would you buy this when it's only a rewards program?
Working product, highly adaptable, government grants, excellent founders, Alibaba advisers, possible partnership etc...
where will this be listed?
ICO starts on Nov 28th> 1st day will have "n" limit for each person in whitelist> Any leftover goes to 2nd day where each perosn is limited to "2n" (n * 2)> Same goes for 3rd day> 4th day all limit is removed until 1 month or all tokens sold out whichever is fastestwill probably go on ED first, not sure about other exchangebecause they have a working product and there is literally no way this coin will stay at 25 cents for 3 months (which is the earliest pre ico can "dump" on them)
Will we be emailed with further details closer to the day?
I think so yes.
Right now there's still no final fix of the individual cap on day 1.
But latest info says it's around 1.4-1.7 eth and subject to change,
Really appreciate it.
