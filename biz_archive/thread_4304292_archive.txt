Sorry bros, looks like you're gonna have to pay 500 satoshi/byte now.Yes, good soyboy, keep feeding gambling money to the house (miners) while you alternate between shiting your pants in fear and getting your occasional dopamine shot when your hell is momentarily interrupted by a calm moment.But don't act now, there's no way the transaction fees could get even higher, right????
