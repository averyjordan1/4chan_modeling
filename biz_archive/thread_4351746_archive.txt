i want it all.... i want it all.... i want it all.... and i want it now
Start by getting the whole picture not just the thumbnail
lol
Spend 8 hours a day wagecucking.>No end of it in sight.>Have bills to pay, tuition coming soon, etc>Save whatever I can, try to chase moon missions (with some success) whenever I can.>No girl looks at me, since I am ugly and on my cuck uniform 8 hours a day.>Outside of work I don't look at any girl,have lost a lot of confidence.
Haven't had sex in nearly a year.>Guys my age of a higher social status are having a blast.I can't even afford an spontaneous road trip, or a few drinks at a bar.
Let alone a prostitute for the sexual satisfaction at least.
If I could afford one she would be some ugly crack-whore, and that defeats the purpose and the allure for me.>The only thing that keeps me going is my narcissism.
I have convinced myself that I am special,and my time will come, in which I shall live comfortably.>Almost at my goal of money saved up.
Soon I will get back to school and use my dividends as my play money.
Until I finish my degree.My life should be a little bit better in a little while.
But the loneliness still gets to me.
Chads are having pic related while I cry myself to sleep alone.
This world is so unfair
Wrong pic lol.
Look on the bright side anon
I want a little bit of sweetness in my life.
So much of it is JUST, right now
Just a little bit?Well, you could make a chain.group account, and put in like the minimum investment.
Not much, nothing to worry about losing, but it's a way to look at a number, "your number" climb every day.
(disclaimer: do not go all or even a lot into one of these.. sometimes they disappear)
