Remember when Biz used to be good?
AKA this past summer?
Holy shit those were good times.
I made half a million dollars in 3 months...
It all started going to shit in August, all these poor, disgusting NEETS with their $200 "investments".
Disgusting.
How dare the profane try to trade alongside with me.
You poor idiots are drawing all the pajeet scammers here, because they know you're stupid and easy to scam, thus you're ruining biz by proxy because the pajeets follow you.
Biz is fine.
