I am a newb regarding crypto and trading - this is my first week.Today I tried a trading strategy, which seems genius/idiotic, but it has worked.
Explain to me, why has it worked so easy please.I trade on binance - t means 0.050% trading fee, using binance coin.Coin x has:1) Lowest sell order of 0.00502) Highest buy order 0.0040I make manual see order at 0.0047 - it sells INSTANTLY (because much lower than other orders)After that I make a manual buy order at 0.0042 - again INSTA buy (higher than other buy orders)I have made many such small teades, each has 0.5-1.5% profit.WHY IS IT SO EASY?
Because of the large spread?I noticed that after 10-16 trades the spread for the coin decreases and this strategy is not viable any more.Please comment - my strategy is pure luck, idiotic, genius or a combo of all 3 lol?
what about fees?
If the spread is this large then yes, this works even without bots.
This is called market making and is usually done by bots with large bankroll.
It is RIDICOLOUSLY easy.I made 20 trades with coin X - the spread got lower (maybe because of MY trades?
?_Since the spread got lower, I swtiched to another coin with large spread and it is working AGAINIf the fee is fee is only 0050% (binance coin), I can just switch to many different coins and trade all day???
Is this genious or am I missing something.
bumb - maybe someone else has used this "market making" trategy?What forbids me from switching from one coin with large spread to a different coin and just repeat the strategy?
when the market moves youre left holding the bags, all for your measely .001% trading
This is exactly the reason to do this only with reliable alts
crypto>reliable
Try this strategy: buy low sell high.Good luck.
no seriously though you guys keep trying to get us to make binance accounts.
yeah, I used to do this with omg back when it was on 200kish sats
