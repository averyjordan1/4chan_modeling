RIP to the once king.Unconfirmed transactions going up by 10,000 every hour.
People think they are buying the dip but will sell when it goes down 200$ more.
I already see people on r/bitcoin who bought at 6000$ getting rekt.I remember just a month ago people were constantly posting "Bow to the king" as my alts got rekt.I suppose karma is a bitch isn't it?I hope all of crypto doesn't die.
I'm not a part of BTC or BCH atm, both too risky.
Gonna chill in the big boy ETH/my alts and hope for the best.Good luck all.
news flash anon, your alts are taking a shit toolook are your usd value faggot
explain how bch is risky when its the new bitcoin at a steal price of 2k this is how forks work
