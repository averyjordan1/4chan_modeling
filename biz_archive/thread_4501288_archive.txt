>Dumped all my Tierion yesterday for 0.00013, after half a year of holding since the ICO>after half a year of not listing it anywhere, they suddenly decide to put it on binance and huobi all at once>it's up 55% today and keeps mooningJUST
 you escaped the hodl meme xd

I learned a valuable lesson from this.
Never falling for just "hodl bro xXDXD" meme again
I sold that piece of shit a while ago at a loss
But you literally would had got gains from holding.
You were short a day.
You said it yourself.
I hope you learned the lesson.The market is so young.
if you just pick a decent project with good backing then you will be alright.You might need to wait a few months.
The stock / crypto market is just a means of transfering wealth from the unpatient to the patient.
It's still below ICO price, which was 0.0003 ETH.
So even if I sold now it would still be a loss.
I have like 10k TNT left, which is fucking nothing.
I'm gonna baghold it for a little while and see there it gets me.
