How is that possible?
ALL HAIL THE ONE TRUE KING

Where?
Someone got filthy rich.
someone sold 2.5 btc for 344 EUR
Get out of here with your fucking euro bullshit, faggot.
Aren't you supposed to be busy stuffing your face with turkey burger?
Pics or gtfo
nm I see it.
Does that really happen?
I thought it goes to the highest buy if you accidentally do that.
Look at the recent trades column
It should NOT be possible.
Gdax got a glitch.
Already did that 3 times today.
Shouldn't you be getting allahu akbar'd?
