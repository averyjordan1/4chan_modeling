Same here dude, ive been getting JUSTed so hard and didnt want to think about another icoLittle did i know that this would not only wipe out my losses but put me in front of the october JUSTing :(
I missed it too, but oh well.
This is the start of future low marketcap ICOs.
I fell for all of these, I had a whitelisted account but didn't even bother to send 1 ETH
I'm really happy so many people on here missed it.
Horrible traders should stay poor.
Fucking idiots thought a sub 400k market cap ico would crash...
Yeah its set a precedent, im pretty excited about that.
Hopefully biz can find the next x10 ico like this one
Why are you so aggressive?
