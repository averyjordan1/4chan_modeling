DAI is going to be so awesome lads.
No more tether.
I'm never leaving the eth chain again.
What kind of returns will this token give?
I don't care, I'm not buying Maker unless I see someone make a good case for it.
DAI won't give returns, it's a stablecoin.
Shit, maker is getting shilled on /biz/.
Time to sell.
