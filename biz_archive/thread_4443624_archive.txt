I'm holding some BTC but I decided to take about 0.08 BTC and do some trading on Binance with it.
I turned it into 0.1 BTC.
Back and forth with some BCH and NEO.
Is this the right way to get started?
I will put in another 0.1 BTC to trade with a slightly higher volumeOpinions from more experienced traders?
