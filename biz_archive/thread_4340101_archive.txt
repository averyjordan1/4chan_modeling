What the fuck, /biz/?
How am I ever going to become rich with this shit tier mining speed?
I don't want to become a wage cuck :'( ...
 h/s?what the fuck are you mining with lol
HD 7850
ETH mining rigs get their speed measured in MegaHashes per second (MH/s).Unless you're mining with a smartphone
unless you're mining with a smartphoneit's close, I guess
give us a screenshot of your active mining software
less than 1 cent a year

how the fuck are you even mining with a 2gb card?
also that card should give you 12 mh/s on dagger hashimoto/ethash
Dude I got a 7850 as well, I also never get those nice hashrates they publish in forums, don't know what I'm doing wrong
4340101>mining monero>eth mining calculatorwhat the fuck are you doing anon?
honestly you'd be better off using nicehash miner
oh right, I forgot because I was focused on ETH, but this tool picks the most profitable coin
nigger what are you even doing
Much better.
4340288It's better than nothing.
Try overclocking your card as much as you can without going over 70c to get the best results
also put your fan to 100% speed
Minergate...why would you even be in crypto?
