Good morning /biz/, let me being by saying I looked through the catalog and didn't see an appropriate thread.
Does anyone have recommendations for reading material regarding day trading of cryptos?
I've actually never done any day trading before, everything I've had until now has all just been investing.
The bulk of it through Fidelty so this is very much new territory for me.
I've been reading I should start on Bittrex, I'm also watching Whaleclub right now but I've seen mixed reviews on it.
I like it because I have access to more than just cryptos.
Another I've read about is Poloniex but DESU when it asked for my SSN I was like "no way".
I've read more "this is what altcoin/ bitcoin/ cryptocurrency is, how it started, how it works" etc articles than I can shake a stick at.
But not much in the realm of "You have bitcoin and want to trade?
Watch this, this is how I make profit".
I appreciate any links or help you can provide.
tl;dr looking for fundamentals but more than "lol wuts a cryptocurrency?"
This is relevant to my interests, have a bump.
Currently reading Mastering Bitcoin and its pretty good to get some base knowledge about BTC But im also in search for good books about (swing-) trading
Same here.
It seems so many focus on explaining what Bitcoin is but fall short on how you can make profit with it.
