I'm not making shit day trading..
I got around $500 ill buy low and sell high.
However sometimes I'll end up loosing and selling low.
In rounds I usually watch the 100-1k sat range and make roughly 20 - 30 sats per mini pump.
which would be like 0.001 btc per sale.
How tf do u make $ off this?
Any good tips?
I've been chasing pumps for a good 4 hours a day.
How tf do u make $ off this?Come back to the table when you have $500.Simple.
