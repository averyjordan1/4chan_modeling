Why don't you guys think litecoin is gonna flippen instead of bcc and eth?
Asking for a brainlet
What is unique about LTC in comparison to BTC?
BCC has the meme 8Mb size plus the name branding and the gook backing...
It has Charlie Lee, the lightning network, lower fees, Jews, litesatoshi, coinbase etc
CharlieeeeeeeHe actively says LTC<BTCHe shills other coins more than his own, he always says LTC is worth less than BTC and he's okay with that.
Used to have 80 LTC in my portfolio, dumped them all for VTC... no regrets.
He actively says LTC<BTCBut that isn't to say that LTC<ETH=BHC, which is more relevant to the question of this thread.
There are only two realistic scenarios:1: A flippening never happens.2: Federal reserve announces XRP is their selection for faster payment processing, Ripple captures SWIFT market share and XRP is now king.These are the only two options.
You realize Charlie Lee is the BIGGEST clown in the cyrptospace, right?
Fuck even go to their subreddit, fucking cult-like with "moon soon omg" since dawn of time.
