What do you think of real estate investments /biz/?
Is it worth getting into, and would owning an apartment complex be worth it?
Any anons flip houses as well?
Any good real estate books to read up on?
Id really like real estate discussion.
Awwww look at the little snake guys
I'm no snake expert but i'd like to help you as best as i can.
That snake is some kind of hognosed snake, searching up "Chubby hognose" gets you some results.
Thanks for stopping by anon.
