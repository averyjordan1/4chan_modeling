4280297Thank you for the insight.
Serious question here: I agree that BCH should be the "real" Bitcoin and is better for actual usage, but the truth is BTC, BCH, BTG, and B2X are ALL shit compared to the tech of most other coins.
If the market was gonna flip into another coin why not flip into LTC something different altogether?
BTC is "better" than those other coins in that it has the brand name and first movers advantage, but what makes BCH better then LTC (or VTC, GRS, etc.)
or ETH/NEO?
AHHHHHHHHH I PUMPED ALL MY DISPOSABLE INCOME INTO SHITT ALTS.
HELP ME /BIZ/, DO I JUST KILL MYSELF OR SELL MY CAR FOR SOME BCH BEFOFE IT'S WORTH 16 BTC AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
