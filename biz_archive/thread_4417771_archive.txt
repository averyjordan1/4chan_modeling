Can bitcoin reach $1m?
It would be worth twice as much as all the gold in the world.
Not impossible.
Highly unlikely.

not thinking the elites want twice as much gold that's in the entire world
To put in perspective a 1 million dollar BTC would mean approximately a 20 trillion dollar market cap, or in other words 1/4th the world’s GDP.
So no, it can’t.
BTC will be replaced well before that happens
44177824417791Guys please.I need to get rich but I have only 0.42 btc and can't afford to buy more.Don't tell me to invest in your shitcoins, I won't.
I won't.
I have a coin I'm gonna get in on when it's available and taking the risk that it could one day dethrone the king, but I won't shill because fuck that shit
It can and will.
It's only crazy until it actually happens.https://www.solarbit.cc/million-dollar-bitcoin.html
sometime during the year 2020 BTC will be $1,000,000.
it is prophecy
I didn’t think your moms fat ass could reach 300 lbs but she did.
Three times as much, and I think Bitcoin is easily three times more useful and valuable than gold.In fact this makes me much more bullish now you've pointed this out.
Not even close man, Bitcoin is right now, like AOL was in the 90s.
It's the first and they hype but as a currency it's a dinosaur piece of garbage that will cap soon
1/4th the world’s GDPYou have to remember that GDP is not the same as global wealth.That's just the world's product for just one year.Bitcoin is going to be around for longer than that so this is not a straightforward comparison.
It's worth twice as much as gold though, or more.Trustless transactions,zero percent chance of getting fake gold.
That fake shit shows up in the most credible markets.
Well as time goes on more and more will be lost.Food for thought: if human civilization goes long enough there will be less than one BTC eventually.
I refuse to take any risks and want ridiculous gains anywaysToo bad faggot.
