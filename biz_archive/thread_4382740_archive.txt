Dear diary, I participated in an "Initial Token Offering" for a mining operation that seems to have its shit together.
Not sure what exactly I bought in the end but I've really wanted to try this whole cryptocoin thing ever since missing out on the $3000 BTC dip mid-September, been thinking about it since the MtGox dip, both of which I knew to be temporary.Research stuff>how-tos full of warnings "note this exchange has been hacked">visit website for BTC-E: seized by US federal government!
ahahhaha!>read the token offer document: many countries listed where this is illegal>fuck it, let's rollDecide on a wallet: MyEtherWallet>wallet creation is fascinating>thankfully don't have to download the entire fucking blockchain>paranoia about key security startsDecide on an exchange: BitPanda>must give email, street address, DOB, telephone for sms pin>sad 50 EUR limit, just gimpy>not possible to deposit with credit card>need to VIDEO TELECONFERENCE WITH PASSPORT IN HAND to unlock high limits and cc>so much for anonymity and untraceability lol>odd experience, it's current year and I'm waving a physical document at a camera>bank deposits listed as a new feature, strangely% transfer fee just to deposit Euros without waiting for 3 business days>so much for fast cross-border payments, this is all inside the goddamn EU too>except that this "Sofort" payment doesn't actually support my country, not mentioned until too late>it is in fact a camouflaged "Klarna" payment, which I have avoided thus far>how do I cancel this shit.. ok there's an option, thankfully>"Unable to find euro wallet transaction with this pid.
">wut>bet it counts towards the pathetic 50 EUR limit anyway>wait for it to timeout>try a regular bank transfer, only 1 day actually>buy Ether!
Transfer ETH from BitPanda to MEW wallet>the mining operation warns not to transfer directly from an exchange>apparently I would silently lose it all>no fees, pretty fast tooTransfer ETH from MEW wallet to mining outfit's wallet>had to get address whitelisted first, again danger of silent loss>some kind of surprising minimum reserve for "gas", not bad though>also fast>there's a referral program with confusing minimums I don't quite grasp, ignore itwew lads.
That was fairly stressful, but now I'm in control of a magic number protected by one-way mathematical equation fairies.
Shouldn't even be dependent on some soviet-bloc admin deciding to abscond to Belize with everyone's current holdings.Next: Bitcoin.
Just need it drop a little...
man this board is faster than I thought... anyway, one last surprise: When I checked the tokens on MEW, besides the mining ones I bought there were some "promotional" tokens I'd never heard about!
Wallets really are visible to everyone... this is all so counterintuitive.
