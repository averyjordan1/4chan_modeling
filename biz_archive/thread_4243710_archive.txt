go to coinmarket cap and check what coins were around at the date start from the top and go to the bottom.
wasn't many in 2013
I'm in a similar position as OP.
I have an old Litecoin wallet.dat.
I have the address saved on a word doc, and when I look it up, nothing shows up on the blockchain explorer.
It definitely existed, but it shows nothing.
This is from 2013

searching the tranaction shows nothing online, usually something comes up.Does this mean the wallet is encrypted?
also, this is what happens when the wallet tries to load in bitcoinqt, now it is "rescanning"

Try exchanging the word opinion with your wallet.dat
