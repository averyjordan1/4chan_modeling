who here getting absolutely JUST'd right now ?
In?
Me.
Thanks to balls deep in odn and link
Bought BTH before the dip
Only getting JUST'D cuz of REQ, which is ok since its a long term hold.
i think any bags i've been holding long term have reached about as low as they're going to go, not getting JUST'd as much anymore latelyactually up quite a bit this week on QTUM that I bought near the low point
nope, I went all in on bitcoin cash cashed out to a nice healthy 1%
dont see how with neo and bcc mooning today.
ive made a shit load of btc
