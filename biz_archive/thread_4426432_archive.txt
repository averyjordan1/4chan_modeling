I'm living out of my car in the hopes Ark moons.
I'm literally putting every paycheck into it.

Mobile wallets this week.
I broke my own trading rule for this:Not more than 25% of my portfolio in one coin.
I've learned that if the project is hitting all the green flags that I look for, it's okay to go heavy into it.
is destiny wasnt such a bitchi mean, 5% of gains for me it's finethe problem is that it always descend no matter when u buy
I made a prediction a few weeks back that ARK will breakout November 24 25 26.
Let's see what happens
