I really hope /biz/ didnt fall for this con artist
Fake news.
fireworks...
Not fireworks.
Boxes of fracitonal dynamite sticks that would not even be legal as fireworks.
4401248Saying they were just "fireworks" is fake news.
Storing Agricultural Grade explosives that would not even be legal as fireworks in a residential apartment next to families is a sick move.
On top of that, they are mailed through the USPS.
Imagine a box of 200 1/4 dynamite sticks going off.
That's enough to kill a USPS worker or take down a plane.
they have fucking firework factories in residential areas in asialike comonshit blows up every week
That is retard logic.
No one stores fractional dynamite sticks in residential apartments, anywhere.
Ver is so obviously a con that it's a wonder in itself that people like you can fall for his shit.
Makes you wonder how dumb the average person is.
"Fireworks"
Korean still buying this shit WHY?
