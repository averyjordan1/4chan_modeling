bought at ATH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Market is correcting itself.
Only normies drop bags.

REAL USE
Buy dip?
HAHAHA DUMP AND PREPARE TO GET PUMPED ON CHUMPS
I was holding 11000 units of this a week ago, and sold it because I thought I was going to lose a few $100.
I don't understand why you Pink Wojacks would buy at the ATH just after it has gone parabolic?
If you didn't buy a half-cycle in advance you're doing it wrong.
Fuck it I'm holding.
It will go up again,
Pack up your bags boys, it was good while it lasted.Hold this will moon again it's a crazy coin in crazy times

No way this coin is not going back up eventually.
The project itself is very well thought out and tackles a very important problem.
This dip is just correction from recent hype
what happened another scam ?
no just a correction
till what in your opinion will it stabilize
Good crypto but suffering from irrational exuberance.
A price correction is incoming.
There's too much total supply to keep the coin afloat for too long.
No, people are just panic selling it because a P&D group dumped massively earlier and all the fudding over PBC.
It's lost its momentum now regardless.
only PBC will save it now or it will hit about 5500 stats and stay there until the team releases new news.
