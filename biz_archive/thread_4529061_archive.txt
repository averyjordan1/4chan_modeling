Congrats on ALMOST reaching your ICO price.
Seriously.
Big if true
true if big.
in terms of USD we already passed it hours ago.
It's that god damn ratio!
Eth is worth nearly $150 more than it was back then
REQ is going to $70.
I'm going to buy a house.
Are u retarded anon?
$ was the ETH value, when people thew it into the ICO.
So ETH is at $500 already?
Jeez
So happy I can finally dump this
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!!!!!
!Fuck Eth ICO price we at 8 cents, everything adjusts to the rising price of its pair, we well above ICO!
Nothing will stop us now!
If you bought eth with fiat in order to get this ico, ur up.
There was no missed money with ethereum if it wS never a plan for investment
what do you value your bitcoin or eth in?that's right.
for now it's still DOLLARS.what matters at the end of the ride when you cash out?
that's right dollar value.
This was beginners luck for me.
I opened my first account and went all fiat->ETH->REQ.
Nice insight thx anon
No it isnt, its 300.
