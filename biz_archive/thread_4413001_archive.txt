>day trade and make 1% profit every day >become a billionaire in a year Why doesnâ€™t everyone do this
Why stop at 1%?Make 10% profit everyday and become a billionaire in weeks
Because that's not how it works
The how does it
>do to /biz/>learn2daytrade>huybigh lellsow>????
But, but anon, it's so simple!
do you understand how much capital you would need to start if you are only earning 1% a day?
meant for (you) not 
% a day doesn't equal 30% per month
Are you really this dumb?
"financial" board my ass lmao
4413111explain then
wow you are a fucking imbecile
 billionaire in a year % a dayyou would need to start with more than $10 million for that you retard
Because you will get rekt by bots or seasoned traders
The absolute state of /biz/, my god1% daily means you include the previous day's gains for the next total, which is a whole lot more than 30% a month.
If you make 1% daily, you end up doubling your initial investment after 72 days
Never skip mathe lessons....I will hook you up with:>What is compound interest?
4413121Its your base capital multiplied by 1.01^365 you dumb nigger.
4413121Jesus.
Fucking.
Christ.
You only need to start with 1000 to have over 1million by the end of a year.
You are fully retarded.
You don't even understand how to calculate compound interest.
Get out now before you hurt yourself.
american "education"
The absolute state.
Jesus Christ I need to leave this board.
You're an idiot for real.
I'm extremely mad well trolled
This board is an absolute joke.
People like him are all around you.
I can't fucking believe this.
How can someone be so smug and arrogant whilst being so mentally deficient.
youll get rekt at trading breh.
but i dont like the idea that i cannot multiply my btc while others can .being a brainlet is pain
Are you just incapable of doing math?
$1000*1.01^356 = 34 546 < $1 000 000.
Its closer to  at $23 298 than to your retarded number.
Are you fucking retarded?
Both sides are wrong.
One in theory, the other in practice, at some point it becomes impossible to earn 1% daily when your capital is around 10k.
Try it yourself.
The orderbook won't let you cash out, ever.
Just trade on 100 pairs with 100$ each then :^)
because you actually have to trade a few pairs with anything above a certain btc amount.
yup, eventually your volume would get too high that it just isn't going to work.
