when everyone is hyping NEO but they dont realize GAS has higher % gains .... the money is in GAS.
it goes up when NEO does but more.
#You'reWelcome
 gas will overtake neo in Q1 2018
I want other opinions, is it true?
we realized lol https://discord.gg/tdNw5Vp
Just check, NEO went up marginally more than GAS, he's wrong
GAS has so much more potential to gain than NEOBuy GAS
Yes in the PBC leak that picked GAS, Teeka said that it was a buy up to $30 and that if NEO became a Chinese state sponsored blockchain the price of GAS could reach $300.
That is because there are only 14 million GAS tokens.
GAS is restricted and it will take 22 years for the supply to reach 100 million tokens like ether.
Yes Gas is a golden egg but neo is farting them out
Another Teeka quote about GAS from that leaked newsletter says:"There are hundreds of hedge funds coming into the market with billions of dollars.
These guys are smart.
They’ll come to the same conclusion I have… and they’ll buy as much GAS as they can get their hands on."
4416530what is the Pajeets exit price target suggestion?
Teeka said no stop loss.
I already told you what he about price predictions.
$100 "would be a very cheap price" for GAS if by next year, NEO could have a larger user base than Ethereum… making it one of the most valuable projects in the world.$300 if NEO becomes a Chinese state-sponsored blockchain.Current supply of GAS is 14 million vs. ether's 100 million.
GAS is the currency of the future.NEO blockchain can do 10000 transactions a second.Worth noting that when Segwit2X was announced to be cancelled GAS pumped harder than NEO and was at 0.7 NEO per GAS.This chart is pretty nifty.https://ratesviewer.com/chart/gas-neo/year/
Imagine 10,000 transactions per second and a current supply of only 14 million GAS!
It will take 22 years for NEO's GAS token to reach the current supply of ether's 100 million!
NEO > ETH> More security> dont have to use eth's shitty language to build on> Developers do not need to learn a new programming language, can use C# and JAVA> most of crypto money is asian, more likely to adopt NEO> NEO is the wechat of china as to US's whatsapp ETH
