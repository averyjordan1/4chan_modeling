Has anyone here owned one before?
I haven't, but it seems like a lot of work if you have to stock and maintain them desu.
I'm not sure how much a high-volume one would make to be worth it.
Try and base them at remote mine sites if possible and raise the price 200% I work for bhp in the pilbara region and this is a massive money maker for whoever owns redvend.
Feeling generous and think it's a good idea op slang some btc my way 1DPMCY1KZJCqt6S5WQDwk4paptuE9DD9o3

Thanks for the tip.
Cheers mate.
Hope it all works out.
I know during shutdown periods (for bulk maintenance repairs) they are stripped absolutely bare.
yea my friend tried to the most expensive part is moving those damn things the only way to move them is a specialized hydraulic dolly so either you have to rent them and pay people to do it for you or you have to buy one and they can be expensive.
You also have to consider stairs and such and make sure to plan ahead before trying to place one.
Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare just trying to place it.
I'll sleep on this.
easy to steal from.thanks for the free passion fruit sodas!
