nice exit scam idea.>devs make 20x and so do their friends>ico investors don't lose their funds so no complaints to the SEC>greedy traders get rekt but SEC doesn't care what happens to traders making peer to peer transactions based on speculationThese guys are good.
They probably lurk here or starting shilling here first.

I woke up not too long ago and I am down over $54K on my investment in CFD.
Can somebody clarify what is going on?
I bought in with almost everything I had when it was .94 cents.
What is happening?
I am seeing rumors that the developers did an exit scam.
Is this true?
Does anyone know why their website is down?
I'm not getting any responses from email or anything.
I feel really fucking sick.
Can someone tell me please what is happening?
Tell that Pajeet dev to fuck off.

Website went down, 'devs' dumped their tokens.
THIS IS WHAT WE GET FOR GETTING SCAMMED, ANOTHER FUCKING SCAM???

/10 LARPING
So if I invest in the Liquidaeon ICO, I get my ETH back AND the liquidaeon tokens?
basically, and you can also change your mind at any time and receive 100% of your eth back (no tokens though).
From what I've seen the developer seems pretty serious and is willing to work for free to achieve their goals.
Joost (or the imposter) spoke Dutch on the telegram.
Whenever a Dutch person asked a questio, he would be there to answer.
This makes me think he is actually Dutch or has the ability to speak and write Dutch fluently.
Ok so I'm retarded.
How does putting eth in this system different from an ICO?
Also what's Liquidaeon about?
Kek this coin was supposed to prevent scams based on smart contracts and now they go and do this.
44698854469885guys...GUYS...GUYYYS!!!
so uhhhh yeah i sent them my last few remaining tokens to try and get a refund.
still no refund.
instead of purchasing the tokens directly, staking your ethereum inside a trustless smart contract allows you to receive tokens in exchange for the 'opportunity cost' paid.
Since you chose to hold your ether in the proof of confidence contract for the duration of the staking period, you are rewarded with tokens because you aren't a speculator.
as for Liquidaeon, think banking/lending.
All systems are based on destructive elements like interest/debt/inflation that rob consumers of purchasing power over time.
Liquidaeon is based on the additive asset of time, with several mechanics built in to achieve equilibrium of value and usage.
OH OH NOO UH UH OH OH AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA OH OH NOO UH UH OH OH AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA OH OH NOO UH UH OH OH AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
Please be real
makes sure you send CNF tokens not CFDCJEERS
they won't do it.
the tokens sell at 3 cents each on delta, so if it was actually real someone could buy them out and sell them for 4 each
True if big

Dead cat was to 15 cents last night.

SO many good keks missed since their faggit went privateBut heres one more for yaFrom "LINKtrader" of coursehttps://www.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/comments/763zqp/my_research_on_confido_an_escrow_payment_platform/> In my opinion they are solving the problem of getting scammed when using crypto in deals not involving a registered company.
> Their team is quite decent.
All team members seem educated
They ironically proved the value of their project by doing this.
mfw I buy 100k at 1.5c and sell at 4cents
