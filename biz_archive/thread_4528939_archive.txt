From what I gather this is literally the best crypto currency around at the moment.
There are around 112 billion doges in circulation at the moment with no hard limit.
So I looked at the current block reward for miners and its about 10,000 every 1 minute.
So at this rate it will take 10 years for another 2 billion to be made.
Thats an annual inflation rate of 0.002%... so its not even an issue
 billion inflation a year.
= worthless coin.
I do not own any Doge or Bitbean.But explain how this is any fucking better than Bitbean, which has better branding.
bitbean has better brandingwhat
It is very good OPIts mostly stable, the only problem is you can't transfer directly with it like with Eth, and people are either lazy or chase moonsI mean without using some third party website
better branding>Literally just about to be re-branded because of shitty branding
what sites can I purchase goods with doge coin on?also it does get pumped and dumped all the time, look at it literally right now
