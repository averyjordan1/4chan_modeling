I presume they are making money on this...if so how much to get listed?
If its a lot then that would explain why not a lot of new coins are listed and would make sense since these ICOs are getting stupid money for their projects.
It costs giving the devs an extremely discounted price on the coin.
Then the devs dump on bittrex retard users.
Look at RCN from yesterday first candle, site is a scam.
I remember when they first added MANA.The first candle was 1 MANA = 1 BTC, you can't blame Buttrex if people are retarded.
Bittrex is a US based company you stupid cumbucket
They are going straight.
The days of pump and dump pajeet coins on bittrex are over.
They are going straight.lmao what gave you that idea
