Anyone else sitting /comfy/ with SpectreCoin right now?>Innovative "stealth addresses" so you can't see purchase origins, so totally anonymous second transaction times>No transaction fees>Literally a better version of moneroThis is about to replace monero as the number one dark net coin to buy drugs with and its only at $.40.
Supposedly its about to moon mission, and over the next couple months replace monero, due to its superiority.I'm actually glad I researched this one.
My profits have been slow, but I think I'm going to wait on this one for a while, even after the moon mission.
Can you just let me be happy with my monero and not replace it????
Prepare for the drug crypto flippening bitch
Monero is fast enough, and has better branding.
