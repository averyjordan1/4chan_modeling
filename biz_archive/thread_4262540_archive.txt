Is it too late, or is it going to keep going?
It's taking forever to get the eth out of my coinbase (stupid place to keep it I know, sue me)
The flippening is upon us...we are the Ethereum now...
it's gonna keep mooning until next year at least
It's not Forbes, it's a "Forbes contributor".
That's just a blogger being hosted by Forbes.
Means jack shit.

Newsflash....WavesNG has been in the works for a while.
If this seriously is the first time you've heard about it you will only lose money with waves.
Faggot.
LMFAOYOU'RE SO SMART BRO
K. Make sure you reference me in your wojak thread.
So you know, I've held waves since august.
I still do.
YEAH I'M GOING TO WOJAK LMAOOKAY
Bought yesterday sold here for a quick 30% thanks
Bitcoin + Lightning can scale to billions tx a second
Nice try pajeet
may here, was about to give up and dump in the clearout
Emin GÃ¼n Sirer
Oh, I've dumped many, many times since then.
lol.
I started playing around with waves because I thought it had potential...after holding it you come to understand you have to dump on people to make anything with this coin.
I just figured anybody being able to generate retarded tokens with zero effort was worth a lot, I still do and waves is prominent enough but I think we're still too early for any of that to be taking off
NIGGERCOIN.
Waves is not going anywhere.
I really don't see it actually taking off until Q1, 2018.
The Christmas dip would be a good time to get in I would think...
muh #niggerCoinMattersKYS.
bitshares is shit, they claim to be able to do 100ktx/sec but that's just an empty claim so far
JESUS FUCKING CHRISTIT'S STILL GOING UPAND IT'S NEVER GOING TO FUCKING STOP
The next billion dollar market cap coin
ethereum is outdated, its much faster and much much cheaper nowyou can send a transaction for only 0.006$ and it will still get processed within a minute
No brakes on this train!
XLM can do that as well.
STOP I DIDNT ACTUALLY WANT TO BE THIS RICH MAKE IT FUCKING STOP NOOOOOOOOOOW
