>be me years old>worked 10 hours a day for 1k$/mo >that's a little more than average pay in Romania >alone in a 'big' college city>somehow be able to attend college even if working through teacher manipulation and good atudent attitude whenever I made it to class(also, college is free here as long as you attend your courses and get good grades>going to a shit college, marketing major>tfw they teach kiddie stories compared to what some /biz/pepes RANDOMLY throw out in threads>sick of learning fake out-dated economyGuys, can you provide me with valid info on how and where to learn bitcoin trading?
I'm almost happy when I see you guys pulling out 3-4x.
Sites to follow, tools to use, threads to lurk, words and abbreviations to learn, I know basic speculating, I'm mad that my college is teaching me just basic, and I want to learn more.Also, ofc I'll keep lurking.
Come to Sweden and beg on the streets.
You will make more money than your current salary.
Do your own research (DYOR), kiddo.
But a good start would be to download the coinbase app and buy some BTC, ETH and LTC.
Also then look at coinmarketcap.com to see all the cryptos.Don't trade.
Just buy and hold for months/years.
Check your GDP.
I pay ~150 bucks for rent, for example.
Also 10/10 would bow for SEK's.
Thank you very much for the info.
Godspeed on your way to the moon.
worked 10 hours a day for 1k$/mopoles here work 12 hour shifts 5 days a week minimum wage for Â£1.5k/mo after tax so you have it pretty good
not OP but say I wanted to buy some BTC and ETH, all I have to do is make a wallet on coinbase and purchase currency, how would that be done, via credit card, paypal like any other online purchase with a small 1-2% fee?
Fees vary I believe, I don't know if you can do other payments but you can set up your debit card(with a weekly cap starting at $200) or your bank account(no cap, but 3-5 day wait on recieving your coins)
Op here, thank you for releasing me from the FUD shitworld.
Well played, by the way.
