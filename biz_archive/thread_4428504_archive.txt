Look familiar?
ETH is the Android of crypto?BTC is the iOS?LTC is the Microsoft?
BTC is fucking nokia
That does make more sense
Yeah but it's 3/10.To see what's going to happen in crypto Google 1st and 2nd Browser war maybe even 3rd.BTC is Netscape, ETH is IE or Firefox at best.
None of these comparisons make sense at all.
If you're gonna do this at least make an argument for why they are similar.Even stupid shit like BTC=gold, LTC=silver, ETH=rare earths is more logical than random technology items.
Android & iOS=cryptoFiat and stocks=symbian
kind of, android wasn't first to market though, in all likelihood BTC or any BTC forked coins will be replaced by a newcomer in the near future and be rendered obsolete; if you're realistic about it and look at transaction times and how bogged down the blockchain is, it's sort of obvious.BTC will be like Symbian in that chart, strong now but eventually die
They're talking in terms of adoption and use, no-brain anon.
btc=gold ltc= silver eth = silicon link=porcelain
Link is like porcelain in that if you drop all the others, they're fine but if you drop link is shatters into a thousand pieces and cuts the feet of all the barefoot anons who were carrying it.
