Your coin/token/penis will have its day.
Ripple was apparently a pump and dumpKEK
thanks for this op shits interesting
I apologize for being a small brain boy and linking to a post in the thread.
I meant to start from the beginning of the it.https://warosu.org/biz/thread/971481
it feels like back biz back then was the smart money.
the way they post and argue looks totally different from what we see now.
maybe they're all millionaires now so they left and took their wisdom with them
They were smart money.
Can't disagree with you.But I still think this is a speculators market.
Everything that is an actual crypto project can only go up if it is successful.
There is a metric fuck ton of money still to be added to the crypto market in the coming years.
People are currently obsessed with quick gains instead of understanding the cryptos which the world will use to function.
I also wouldn't contribute luck to wisdom which is probably most of the cases.
I'm sure people bought ethereum based on the consensus of biz at the time.
Most of the new millionaires found their new communities and no longer need 4Chan are their refuge
NOLINKERS BTFOthis couldve very well been a chinlink thread.
all the fudders say the same shit.
Newfags don't know this was still in a time when everyone thought alts were nothing but pandacoin tier scams Making comparisons from the shit coin you are emotionally invested in to eth or even btc because "huur people shit talk it" is the most desperate and delusional shit I've seen on this board
Screen cap this and look back in a year..Buy "ARK" $3.20 11/15/2017$410.06 11/15/2018
I wonder how many of those people saying ETH was going nowhere FOMOed in at $400 and are still trying to give advice like they know any fucking thing.
>I'll stick with bitcoin, ltc>ETH is for daytradingKEK
Screencap this niggers.The next "Ethereum" I believe is "Cardano.
"just remember you could of bought it now at like $.02I have not seen a team this strong since Ethereum started.Don't let the high supply fool you it was to make Asians more comfortable with values.
Yen, bla bla.Anyways..goodluck friends if you missed every opportunity thus far, invest and hodl and you may just make it.
>Protip: You can do everything that Ethereum can do with Bitcoin-style smart contracts by manipulating trust relationships of external resources.>Trust /biz/ to fall right on this hype train.
Ether is actually a huge joke amongst Bitcoin professionals ...
It wasn't even the first coin designed around smart contracts.
it still is but millionares are willing to throw money at it, so people think it's real
The fuck is a 'bitcoin professional'?
These people are still poor and lurking while considering suicide every day>The visionaries are living in mansions, driving lambos and fucking modelsReally teaches you.
Sometimes /biz/ is right.
This is exactly what I thought as well.
Posts are well-written with enough skepticism and not outright shilling for some coin
If I made millions I would never come back to /biz/ desu
