>center of earth is literally filled with lakes of molten goldWhy dont we just make a big long pump and suck it up?
Not as easy as it sounds
We just need a really long hose and your mom to suck it through

We don't even need to suck it up, all you do with gold is store it in vaults anyway so you could just pretend the center of the earth is a big vault, then you could sell shares of it.
center of earth is literally filled with lakes of molten goldAm I being rused?
because the earth is flat you fucking idiot
During the formation of the Earth, molten iron sank to its centre to make the core.
This took with it the vast majority of the planet's precious metals â€“ such as gold and platinum.
In fact, there are enough precious metals in the core to cover the entire surface of the Earth with a four metre thick layer.Sep 7, 2011
>earth>not hollow
this is very true i think i can make money on this shitcoin
KekYou know the guys in the pacific that used ENORMOUS stones as a currency.
You didnt necesarly need to move it so ig you had one somewhere you could use it to pay with it IF the previous owner said it was yours.Based on this concept some people used rocks that had been dropped into thr ocean by accident from a shio travel.Pretty much the same than what you just described.
