What value is that at in usd right now and what do you expect it to become?

Apologies minor correction, it is now at 3mil market cap.10mil circulating supply.
When does it get on new exchanges?
I dont think they can disclose anything yet.It doesnt even have a CMC listing, it's more of a hidden gem.
Good team, good product with a working beta, it was trading under ICO when I posted but its now back around ICO.Working Beta: https://www.bitboost.net/blog/open-beta-version-block-already-available/
in for the ride now.
Get out,buy back in around 0.0005 price.It's been pumped.Binance will not be seen for a few weeks or months.
Youre sitting on bags.
Take a look at HST.Has it been on Binance?No.
This is a pnd and those who shilled it already won 2x.
