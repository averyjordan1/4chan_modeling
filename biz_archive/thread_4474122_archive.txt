As a conservative trader who aims to make 2-5x on moons and 30% gains on dips what should I expect for when I feel my first JUST.
Hasn't happened yet but I know it will happen eventually so how will I resist the urge to kill myself?
Just don't put down more money than you can afford to lose on gambles.
Glad I only lost $80 on potcoin.
conservative trader-5x% on dipsI hope you’re joking
I actually laughed my ass off at this...
I REALLY hope he's joking
30% on dips>conservative
pretty easy to make that much on moons when you do some basic math with market cap and shit and even easier to make money on dips after a coin goes parabolic.
Its so easy im not sure how people lose money in crypto.
Okay ignoring how ridiculous your post is, let’s talk about the first just.
You’ll be discouraged, and feel like an idiot.
You’ll log on biz and see everyone talking about how much money they’re making or how easy crypto is.
Then you might want to sell your bags at a big loss (mistake) then chase a coin that is currently mooning ( big mistake) and end up buying at it’s all time high right before it drops and doesn’t see that high for months (biggest mistake) .
That’s the cycle of most noobs, so learn it to not do it
just come on / biz/ and see how much worse other people got JUSTEDI lost 2k of my 17k portfolio an hour ago but other people lost way more and it makes me feel betterstill want to kms though
I only buy dips after a huge spike so large swings in value are extremely common and easy to capitalize on
