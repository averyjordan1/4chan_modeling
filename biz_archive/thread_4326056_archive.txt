TSIAI cant be bothered to transfer it out (all my holdings are in btc rn) so i thought whoever is NEET enough to grab this first should have it.

4326141what are IDs
Received ;)
Just send some eth to it before you can withdrawyes, money is that easy folks
what does pajeet mean by this?
4326141
It's a pretty much worthless Minereum Genesis Address.
You can't claim those Minereum, they are locked in and get mined over time.
jesus fucking christa few idiots actually sending eth to the adress
lol you people are fucking retarded
These are the same type of people that fomo into bitcoincrash
haha this is amazing.
you fucking imbeciles stop sending ether to this address, you can't claim it.
4326490how did you get this?
OP didn't post an ethereum address
We really need some fucking mods to range ban every single of these subhuman third worlder beg fags
holy shit just drop out of crypto and stop.this is the address of the private key: https://etherscan.io/address/0xb7605ddc0327406a7ac225b9de87865e22ac5927people are to fucking retarded
myetherwallet, paste private key, click etherscan.io and look at the idiots sending eth to adress in an attempt to send the tokens
ah right I mistook the private key for an address.
not used to seeing non-address strings
4326387LMAO
4326178fucking why
What's the angle here?
Anons think they're requesting from that address when they're really sending to it?
I'm 0x5fcee- OP got me for $7 before I gave up lol ..
I threw $7 at a potential $11,000 return ..
I don't consider that the same as the retards losing thousands fomoing BCH
Anon - fucked up though.
- Since it's a written consent form to have token for free, it's actual theft.And since the solidity og whatever written code transfers funds to another adress, it should be noted that you could press charges.
Fucking pajeet prob got a bitfinex account or something.
Follow the trail and report,
It's even worse because with BCH they at least had a chance of making moneyYou're just a gullible retard
lol its SEVEN FUCKING DOLLARS
see
I would love to see a Pajeet scammer get taken to task over $7.
Can you imagine the memes?
