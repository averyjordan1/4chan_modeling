Is there a way to track down who your orders on EtherDelta went to?One of my fat finger sell orders (about 500x market price) went through and I actually feel bad, I must have taken this dude's life savings and I want to give it back.
Is this possible?
Will I have to go through the ED smart contract token transfer history?
omg that was me... on CFD right?i would be so grateful
