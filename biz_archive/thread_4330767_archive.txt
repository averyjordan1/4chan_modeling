Bitcoin is king.Trashers only proved our point, no alt kills Bitcoin.
It's tanking again
The flip is overJewish payback comin you motherfuckersASIC resistance on the way
Sorry you bought BCH at .42 but that's really not BTC's fault you chinkcuck.
what's a good entry point, right now all in on ETH and have no idea what is going on the last few days but I see alot?
For what kek?
BTC is still in downward spiral.
DEADC A T
BTC is where it was 2 weeks ago.
So... Meh.
The uncertainty is far too great.
I'll just stay in ETH and see small but consistent gains
dont core saying "its an attack!!!"
make you realize btc is 'attackable'?
CRAWLING IN MY SKIN
 As long as attacks don't manage to kill it off entirely they mean nothing as waiting out til it continues to climb is no isse.
Ain't the first one anyway.
I cashed out all my btc.Even if you don't consider the upside and downside right now, I just don't know how it can be worth it to stay in the market right now.If shit gets sorted out you can always get back in and take a small hair cut, If it continues the downward spiral you can get back in.What isn't worth it is living with a pink wojak in the back of your head ready to pop out at any time fucking up your mental processes
Yes, it's attackable, but it's not sustainable.
Grab popcorn, wait, and let the likes of Ver throw even more of his money away.
thats a good point actually
All hail the king
Also it is strange how all those people saying that BCC will replace BTC called for the price of BCC in BTC lol even they aren't that silly to believe that king can fall to the trick of those scammers
What am I apologizing for again?
