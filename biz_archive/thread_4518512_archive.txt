Am I a retard if I buy link right now?
yes.
Depends.
I mean there's more much better options right now.
Why link?
I have an IQ of 159 and I hold 38,505 LINKs, so take that for what it's worth.
I decided to hold it (longterm) a few days ago but I wanted to wait for it to be even cheaper.
Is it likely to ever go back to 0.15$?
