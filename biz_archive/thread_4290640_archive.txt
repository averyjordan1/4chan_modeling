Fuck it, you know what they say: If you can't beat them, join them.
I'm tired of losing money trying to guess when the next Pump is going to be against when the next actual, "natural" moon is going to occur.
What are some good PnD groups to join?Low member pajeets stay the fuck away.
Fucking bump
same here.
i dont give a fuck if theres people who get just'd from this, just give me easy gains
the only ones who get justed from pnd groups are the (lowest) members of the group themselves.statt and admin dictate veerything and you get dumped on.how fucking retarded are you?
I am looking for some PnD groups to join as well, fk'ing loss $ in the penny stocks.
just found /biz/
Well if PnDs aren't worth joining, then it's official, the jews got to crypto, our generation's last hope at making money.
Brb gonna kms.
4291122Where were you faggots when I shilled ZCG today?
Instead all i got was "pajeet this pajeet that"I also shilled EPY yesterday and it 2x but no none of u fags were there.Just keep an eye out from now on
i learn my lesson when i started buying coins when they were 20+ out of fomonow im only buying at dips.
the market is like a sea with tidal waves.
you buy when the tide is low and you sell when the tide is high
The problem with that is that, you are anonymous, anon.
PnDs are better in groups when coordinated (and not for the benefit of the fucker pajeet), we would otherwise have no idea you're attempting a PnD.
That's trading.
What are good coins that fluctuate regularly to trade like that?
