This is a copy and paste, thought you guys might be interested:Bitcoin Cash SIGNAL (Mid-term signal)The trading idea is based on a volatility breakout.
Now the price moves in narrow range between 1200.00 and 1120.00 levels.
MACD lines stay at the signal level and it’s an additional confirmation of range market conditions.
We should be ready to see a breakout above or below the borders.
It will give us a new trading opportunity.
As we can make profit only from buying, we should place pending orders above 1200.00 resistance level.
Entry level is 1150.00 with stop at 1075.00 level.
Profit targets are 1400.00 and 1600.00 levels.
If you don’t use leverage, trading volume for this trade is up to 5% from your deposit.
