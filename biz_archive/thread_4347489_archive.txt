you are just a simple faggot if you haven't bought in
Next LINK-tier /biz/ flushout right here
What's so special about NULs, other than the persistant shilling?
Not sure why you still asking....
4347518China doesn't give a shit about you.
Competition tomorrow.
The coin is meh but it's about to skyrocket because it's literally a game of "We'll pay you to pump our own coin."
Oh yeah that shit.
If I don't have any right now, have about $100 funds to trade with, and I'll only get back to my PC tomorrow evening (so in about 20 hours), is it at all worth looking into?I'm not a particularly active or expert trader but if this competition is actually going to have a significant effect in a short timeframe with little risk, then why not
To clarify, I can buy some right now, then I'll go to sleep and not get back for 20 hours.
>buying a chink coin up 100% in a week Well i would be a idiot not to buy
I had 700 NULS I bought the second it was on binance.
Held for 24 hrs to never see it break my entry point.
Sold, mooned 3x within the hour.Never ever fucking again.

Not looking to buy again though, looking at other coins atm
