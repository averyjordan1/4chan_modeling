Some of you know me for my Link updates.
Today I want to shill a different coin, Alis.
I just bought some for Thursday's token burnout.
It's mooning already and once it goes above ATH the sky's the limit.
Just remember to be careful and exit as soon as volume leaves the coin after the token burn.
They'll release their platform in December, but I don't know that I will hold that long.
