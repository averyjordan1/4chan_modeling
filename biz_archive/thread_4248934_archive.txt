Anyone still holding Red Pulse?Thinking about selling for more LINK or REQ, maybe even COSS
Don't go Coss their shit is buggy and they are a Singaporean exchange so you're looking at 1/10th us volume at best if they can keep gaming and botting to a minimum.
Req and link are solid though have decent amount in both.
Goddamnit OP, you are thinking of selling shitcoin A to get more of shitcoin B C or D.Get the fuck out of those ICOs.
COSS is one of my most comfy holds, why are you fudding?
They are still in Beta as of now, what do you expect?Why are you so negative?
red pulse was such a fucking scam....>botched ico sale caused me to become a neo bagholder>rpx only availlable on some shitty no-name exchange>below ico price
RPX is still up 50% from ICO, bud
RedPulse RPX is long therm investment.
Dont sell brah.
We are looking here for 2019/2020.Why you invest into ICO?
If you think, that you will become rich over night.
You are doing it wrong...
k RPX holder here btw.RPX team is one of the most professional in the cryptofield.
They will deliver.
But it will take the time.
Be patient.
Forget about it and we talk at end of 2018 on how it goes.
What you are saying is :Lets pray this team can write code and deliver something.This is not how you crypto faggot.
