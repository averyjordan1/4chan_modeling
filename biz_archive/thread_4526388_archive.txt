can someone give me a quick rundown on pic related BTG?haven't checked my bittrex in a while and just noticed I all of a sudden have 0.24 of this, I guess it was from some fork or?what do I do with it, will it have the same long-term fate as BCH?
As I said yesterday both are Chinese.
Bch will be memed as real world use while bitcoin gold will be memed as "store of value".
oh wait, I just noticed that 0.24 of this stuff is more or less worthlessso I guess I'll just let it sit therejust another shitcoin until further notice
