I've making neutral gains in the ETH shelter after the first dump of BCH, is it safe to ride BTC back up to its ATH of 7200?
yep back to 7K soon now that BCH stupidity is over
this was a minor hurdle for BTC.
I admit this one was probably the worst, but I believe it is going way further than the ATH.
if you dont believe me just look at what normally happens after such a dip.
i bought in again at 5800. do it OP you still have time.im holding til $8k+
