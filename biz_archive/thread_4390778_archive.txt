>mfw found an ICO which will certainly moon but it requires passport information and the company's data protection policy is sketchy afHow loose are you guys with giving out personal info for these things.
I'm usually pretty loose but I actually read the policy and it allows them to send my personal details to any affiliated entity...
Nothing to hide nothing to fear
I know the one you're talking about.
It's amost guaranteed to moon though
>He bought ICON
Which one anon?
Does it start with a W ?
I sent all my info but at the beginning I wouldnâ€™t do that
Just tell us anon
