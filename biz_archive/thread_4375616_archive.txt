I miss old /biz/>tfw you can't go back to when this was a slow and far better board>tfw you could have bought $1-3 ETH if you had listened to the shills
remember the resume threads that would take forever to 404?
when crypto had a general?you know it started getting bad when all of the BLACKED threads starting showing up.
thats when you know there is too many /pol/ refugees :(
Damn, I forgot crypto even had a general.
Pretty crazy, looking back on it.
Im glad those days are gone.
My eth has went x100 since then
The ETH mooning this year was fucking magnificent around here, remember anons increasingly shitting their pants asking if they were too late at $30 $40 $50
I bought at $3 and held for a yearI have never been as happy as I was when I saw it hit $200
I got so bored hodling BTC during the bear that I was ignoring the entire market, but by some stroke of luck made it onto ETH by 12, didn't buy enough though obviously.
Those first months of the year were so much fun though, everything was winning
First trade I ever did was buy ETH at 60$ and then I sold at 125, thought I really pushed the limits ...
let's hope this will repeat itself
Bought ETH on a biz tip here for like $15 in February, back when having two crypto threads on the first page was considered a shill attackChrist, if I could just go back with what I knew now
