Short term, this is going to pump.
Year end rollout.
Long term, take a look at the whitepaper: https://modum.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/modum-whitepaper-v.-1.0.pdf
Sitting on over 30k mod.
Waiting for the inevitable moon but it is taking longer than I hoped.
Someone posted a comparison of Mod to Walton and it is really similar to the point right before Walton mooned.
And WTC had absolutely NO news before it pumped.
MOD is finalizing integration in to leading logistic provider Q4 2017, and rolling out Q1 2018.
This is as usecase minded as it gets.
Yeah Mod is still the most undervalued project I can find with the nearest short-mid term gains coming as well as great long term potential.
