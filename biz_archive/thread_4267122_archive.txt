It's healthy to expand your point of view, in this thread we will explain why you should drop the coin you are currently holding.
>why you don't think Vertcoin is gonna make it
Vertcoin ONLY has the community, GRS is far more superior, did you know grs was the first coin which had segwit activated, also you can send grs via SMS.
And the most important reason to buy GRS is that it's only 10k sats, not 70k
