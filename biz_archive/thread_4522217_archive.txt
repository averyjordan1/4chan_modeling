litecoin is starting it's moon mission get in now for an easy 30%
I've been preaching this for the last 3 days.
Litecoin has been in a dip for a while and always moons when Bitcoin does.On top of that the lightning update makes it was more viable and a utility than BCH ever could be
this was the orderbook last night.
Was happy to finally see the buy side bigger than the sell side....
now check it out this morning : ) only 110k ltc to $100usd/ltc
>sold my ltc for etp>both went up 25%Wish I could have rode both.
Why does everything have to rise at the same time?
It's going to ~$85-$90 in this wave, possibly higher depending on FOMO.
hopefully we can finally break 100
>ltc>ever going anywhereYou know this coin has been around since ever and it never mooned, right?
this is gonna be big.
The big three are going to leave humanity behindBTC to 10KETH to $500LTC to $100
It has mooned multiple times this year?
Considerable resistance at $80 on gdax.
about 45k ltc worth of sell orders to $80.
Might take longer than today, maybe not though if volume and buying keeps up at the level we're currently at.
Wanna know how I know you're a newfag?
ive been holding for 6 months, up down up down, i finally sell and its starting to gain traction again
buy in.
it's goinng to 100 USD
Guys, something is seriously wrong.Litecoin....Litecoin....$100....Real world use cases....0....Litecoin....$100This doesn't compute.
Get the fuck out of crypto now.
Fuck you, it will be down to $52 in a week
I buy my morning coffee with litecoin.
Maybe... You're still a newfag because it doubled in August.
rubbish it has usage
I just pad for my Thai dinner the other night with Litecoin.A large portion of the Bitcoin ATM's around the US buy and sell Litecoin now too which is cool to see.store of valuemedium of exchangeimmutabilityThese are real world use cases whether you like or understand it or not.
You sound very insecure.
can someone please explain this chart to me?
I'm a newbie
it basically means BUY LTC now before the price moons even harder
real world use cases
You'd be wrong to assume that.
Yeah this is the "order book" "depth chart"Orderbook tells you how many buy and sell orders there are and at what price.The Depth chart is basically just a visual representation of the orderbook.The red side are the "asks" or sellsthe green side are the "bids" or buysThe bottom part of the chart is obviously price and the left and right sides are the volume in LTC.
cheers

Thank you.
So why is this a good thing?
Looks to me as though there are more bids but the majority of them are ridiculous prices?
Surely a moon happens when there are lots of buys around the current price?
Oh it's not that big of a deal.
go look at BTC/USD or ETH/USD, their buy sides have been like 4x bigger than the sell side for a couple months.It was just a little victory to finally see the buy side bigger than the sell side on Litecoin, I don't think it necessarily means "moon imminent".
Cool thanks :)I have another question too.
When people talk about portfolio sizes, lets use an example:% BTC % ETHWhich of these does this mean?1.
$1000 of BTC and $1000 of ETH at current price2.
1BTC and 1ETH3.
buying $500 BTC and $500 ETH and then buying equal amounds repeatedly there onwards
I use Litecoin more than BTC.
$0.01 fees and faster confirmation time
You forgot XMR to $1000
% btc 50% eth means an equal usd value of each.
st option
No problem.Yes its equal fiat value so point 1 or 3 you made works... You have to remember each crypto has it's own specific supply, there are about 4.5x more Ether than there are Bitcoin.
Value held (i.e.
current worth) or value bought for?
Itâ€™s like watching cable TV.
My eyes are glued to the orderBook and history tabs like 6 hours a day
Current value.
If I bought $1000 worth of btc and $1000 worth of eth, and the btc went up to $1500 while eth stayed the same, my portfolio allocation would be 60% bitcoin, 40% ethereum.People often rebalance their portfolio from time to time when it deviates too much from what they want.
In my example I could buy $250 worth of eth using my btc to once again obtain a 50/50 split.
haha same here man.
I watch that shit way too much to be honest.
Tradingview is decent for tracking specific coins, if you haven't made an account there yet.
thanks :)
