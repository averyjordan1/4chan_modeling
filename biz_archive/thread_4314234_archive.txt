I bought Bitcoin Cash when it first hit Bittrex in the summer and pumped to 0.4 BTC before dumping to hell.I was new to crypto and panicked.
It was 1 whole Bitcoin worth of BCC and I lost 80% of it.I just saw the price of BCC pump past my buy in point back then.I'm literally on suicide watch right now.
