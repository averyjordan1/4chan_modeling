So many people tell me, "Calm down, you're an early adopter!
Everyone who's in this space right now will be filthy rich!
"I tend to think the market will crash at any moment.
I believe in the tech, but the tech is totally different from the market bubble we're in.
The internet changed the world, but the dotcom crash still happened.So, every day I make risky trades, because I know that every additional day I spend in the market is putting myself at tremendous risk.
Time is the most valuable resource, not risk reduction or lowering volatility.Simply put, I need to make my money fast, and get out as soon as possible.
If it crashes, the dream is over, and this opportunity will never come again in my lifetime.
I wake up every day in a near panic attack because I feel like I'm the only one aware of the truth.
youre a fudder anon thats not called rational thought thats called fudding
