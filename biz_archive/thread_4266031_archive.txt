YOU FAGGOTS ARE TALKING ABOUT ACCUMULATING CHEAP ALTS BUT BITCOIN IS EXPENSIVE AND I CANT BUY ALTS HOW THEY FUCK ARE YOU DOING IT REEEEEE
i think on HITBTC you can buy alts directly with USD.
what?
you do realize if bitcoin is expensive you get more alts for the same amount of FIAT?if you trade an expensive btc away for alts immediately after buying it what's the problem?
Buy fucking eth on coinbase an then trade for it
you can buy fractions of bitcoin u doofus, no need for a whole bitcoin
forget btc
