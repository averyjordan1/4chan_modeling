Doing some mining in anticipation of an XMR boom.Nearly 2KH/s so far and rigging up all my idle equipment for it, at half mast so far.XMR seems like the big kid on the block of completely anon crypto so I figured it might go somewhere.Any of you holdan?
Holding and mining on 3 desktops, 3 laptops and 2 Chromebooks checking in
It's surprisingly efficient and doesn't kick your hardware's teeth and thermal paste in.Nearly 50 watts for 550 H/s on my blender rendering laptop and it's outputting a generously low amount of heat.Bless cryptoknight.
