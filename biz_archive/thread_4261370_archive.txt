How do the order books work on Crpyto exchange sites?How come if I am selling more volume at the same price as someone else, that they get their trade done first?
Is it first come first serve?
Random?
first in.
always place orders 1 sat higher or lower to avoid que
Ok thanks anon
Do you have to wait for someone buying the same amount for the same price that you're selling for?
With bittrex and binance orders can be partially filled
First come fist serve.
Look up the difference between market and limit orders while you're at it.
Seriously?
That's never happened to me before.
