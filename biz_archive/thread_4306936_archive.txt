You see those unconfirmed BTC transactions, its BCH turn and it will last way longer than just 3 days.
Get ready for the dumpening.
You have been warned.
This is not how it works.When you can to choose between an easy job two days a week and bit harder proper full-time job, and both pay you hourly rate, which one would you choose for consistent profits?This is the weakest argument for BCH as of yet.
this kinda sounds retarded imho
