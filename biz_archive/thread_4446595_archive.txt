k cats here
If it hits $50 then it'd have to be at a $300M?
After people starting using their pool option to get into ICO's for better bonuses + start using the platform to create ICO's and manage the coins then maybe it reaches that one day, probably not by December (:?
Plus of course the many other smart contracts they'll be adding.
Let's just get to $10 first though :p that's a $73M market cap.
i think 5 is realistic till mid decemberthe platform will be released in q1 2018 so 10 would be possible maybe
