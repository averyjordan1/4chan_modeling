KRAKENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNI NEED TO BUY
After I lost my money in the last BCH pump thanks to Kraken being absolutely unable to function, I moved to Bitfinex.
If you have money on Kraken you're a fucking idiot and deserve losing ALL OF IT
Would I need to provide verification for bitfinex?
No but if tether fails you will have nothing
bitcoin crashes on bfx but stays flat on kraken:^)
