Okay this is seriously not normal.
I need some help.Guys, I am trying to move my bitcoins from my wallet to an exchange but it's taking forever to confirm.
Meanwhile the price is plummeting.
What can I do?!
Nothing.Thank you Core for your retarded 1mb limit.
Hope you held onto your BCH from the fork.
Even worse is if all the miners move over, you'll never get your bitcoins.>stuck in the mempool for life
you have to attach a big fee to get it movinghttps://estimatefee.com/

!you can download a wallet with shapeshift and exchange it for bch right now!!

There is nothing you can do anon, just ride the flames down.
Hope you held onto your BCH from the fork.thanks mr coinbased for stealing my shekels
no, really.There's currently 150,000 unconfirmed transactionshttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactionstransactions with the largest fee get priority.https://estimatefee.com/At the moment it's $12, but that will probably rise soon
That’s your own stupid fault.
If you don’t control your keys they’re not your coins.
