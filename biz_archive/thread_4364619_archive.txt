>sent a couple hundred dollars from mycelium wallet>pick the "economic" fee, not the lowest but it says it takes 2-3 hours hours later and 0 confirmationsWtf is going on lads?
btc is dead.
you can never move it out your wallet again.
eternal hold.
should've read the fine print dumbass
you're transacting on the wrong coin lad, your money's gone.
don't worry, I have a farmhand position available for you
My last BTC transaction took 2 days.
It was a large amount at hefty fees, eventually it got picked up though.
Don't panic, it'll get confirmations.
Do you have hand-cranked BCH mining rigs for me to work on mista?
This made me feel better about it.
I know I sent it to the right address its just taking longer than expected
What makes bitcoins fees so high?
Nobody wants to pay 10$+ to move money around
I mean, I have a transaction I confirmed during the BCH clusterfuck a few days ago and it's apparently still in limbo until the 18th.
Literally a full week.
What kind of fee did you pay?
It was only like two bucks.
I just bought $50 in BTC to move to an alt during the shitstorm.
If you paid the 'economic fee' your tx will never confirm.But don't fret, it will be deleted from mempool after 2 weeks and you can try again!
Find out how much your tx was in sat/b, and compare to here:https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#24hIf you're buried in the pile then you're fucked mate.Or post your txid and I can tell you how fucked you are.
