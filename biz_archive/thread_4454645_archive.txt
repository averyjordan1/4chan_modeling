>tfw tether sends us all back into the stone ages
Haha these white crackers always fall for our ploys.
I can even admit it, and they will still fall for it.
Stupid ass white bois.Don't buy BTC
Is there really not another token out there that represents US dollars?
There's a billion fucking ICO's, why is this the only choice
man these fuckers are literally destroying crypto right now.
if that bubble bursts we're all fucked, since there is probably a whole fucking lot BTC, that was essentially bought for 0 $.
(or you know, 7000 USDT)BTC will crash, alts will crash.I am actually awaiting some short term gains on some alts of mine and then i am probably going to book it for a while.
also why the Saturn ring????
REEEEEEEEEEEE!
