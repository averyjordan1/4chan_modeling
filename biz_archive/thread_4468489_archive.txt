Sold this 3 hrs ago, it will dump as soon as PBC doesn't tip it.

Dump is going to be epic
didn't PBC already declare it's not SLR nor POWR?why are people still holding on to that feeling?
PLEASE DO NOT BUYcheck the damn RSI it's severely overboughtall news has been already priced in and pumped since last nightit's in limbo and the whale group behind the pump are trying to dump on you

Thanks bro.
sitting out tonight and getting my head square before going back at it in a few days.
Extended f/family has all kinds of shit they want me to do, so I can't really focus properly ATM.
i've been doing nothing but losing ever since i entered last month.
i'm already down like 40% but you live and you learn.
i need to stop browsing /biz after a enter a trade because i noticed it affects my mood and confidence in any position im in.
If you don't have iron balls, FOMO will be forced into you.
It's hard to do long-term holds when browsing /biz/, but fuck it.
