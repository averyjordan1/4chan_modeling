Can I have a pattern example of what might be considered a sign of "whale accumulation"?
Fuck hueg volume.
So, high volume and a stagnant price?
Yeah.
Then moon.
lol no, huge volume and stagnant price is awful and a sign of a dumpI got burned hard by SNT at 2k sats because of it, went up only 10-20% on ridiculous volume then dumped to hellI dont want to give you specific examples because I dont want biz shilling my coins since their weak hands will ruin the pump, but accumulation = 50-100% price increase followed by full retrace.
Over and over and over again.
Then eventually, who knows how long though, the price will explode
