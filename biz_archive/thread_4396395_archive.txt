Is there anything you can do to royally fuck over people who promote their Bitconnect referral links?
The most I've been able to accomplish is troll them by wasting their time and pretending to be a fucking idiot who doesn't know how the internet works.
they probably already made good money off of their retarded followers.
Depends on where they post the links.
If they run their own shitty wordpress blog crawling for vulnerabilities and replace the links with own affiliate code would be very funny.
I have found that threatening to tell SEC about them tends to spook them and they start getting nervous.
But I would like to do something that really screws them over.
Possibly by making them invest into another scam?

Anyone tried Bitconnect?
Does it really work?
Yes.
IT works... until it doesn't.
I’ve made a shit load from it, more than my initial investment and I have referred nobody.
Make hay whilst the sun shines and all that.
being this much of an asshurt faggotyou know literally anyone who signs up for something like bitconnect knows it could go down any time?
They just don't give a fuck and are taking a risk like any investment.Why do things like bitconnect trigger you faggots so much?
Well put anon.
4396937Then why isn't everyone using it if it works?
Because they are scared of their own fucking shadow.
You gotta take risks anon or you’ll never make it.
We all end up dead anyway, who gives a fuck.
BTC is giving me higher ROI than Bitconnect ever could at the moment.
the way its run is shady fuck and the referral program acts as a pyramid scheme.
It looks like a pyramid scheme + ponzi scheme combined.
There is no way this isn't a huge scam.
pyramid scheme = ponzi scheme ?
Pyramid scheme + Ponzi scheme.Two different scams in one.
