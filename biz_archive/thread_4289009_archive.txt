>He listened to the scammer tone vayshow does it feel to be a no bitcoin casher?
I flipped 100 of my BTC for ~1200 BCH.
Comfy.
lol show proof sign a msg with your addressI didnt buy as much as i would like to because i didnt expect for bch to just go straight to the moon like that
lol this tiny vays guy... he actually thinks people who bought segwit2x should start a lawsuit against all exchanges that listed it.
also, he is loving the fact that once CME takes over, the only way to LEGALLY trade BTCs will be through them.
seruously i'm not buying BTC anymore.
the people running it are fucking greedym scammers.
BCH is looking more interesting.
fuck bitcoin and fuck CME.
i just hope they don't make ALL cryptocurrencies illegal.
