Why does /biz/ keep trying to find the next confido when confido hasn't even started yet
20 eth deep into this baby, let's goooo
Gonna hold this for a long time, got in during the ICO and cant wait for it to start generating profits for muh dividenmdns.
Holding 402 confidos until we overtake ebay.

This still a solid buy?
I'm about to pump 10 ETH into this dirty cocksucker.
Shill the fuck out of this to me, anon.
we finna kill ebay nigga.
ebay 36 bil market cap.360x gainz left.
Buying after a 25x pure hype pumpOnce again, buy high sell low
New exchange coming soon possibly binance so prepare for another pump soon now would be a good time to buy
because you can moon on 2 rockets...best combo is confido and Emphy(EPY)
You can probably buy it for half price after the Binance dump.
but then the hype is over and you should find the next confido
- A new exchange being announced this week -(not Binance, possibly HitBTC or Livecoin).- Binance coming in December.- Alpha coming in January.
Confido is the next Confido
I donâ€™t do crypto investments but I do plan on using this for my business
