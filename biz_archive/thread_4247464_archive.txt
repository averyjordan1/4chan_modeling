BCH?
OMG?
SALT?What is your favorite pick for the post 2X flippening?
ITT we plot our trade strategies for 2X.
SALT has been going up very quickly and I don't think its a P&D due to how long its been going on.
the 300 BTC buy wall is pumping the price.Expect it to dump when we hit 50k.
Buy back later.
I'm going to park some BTC in ARK right after the fork.
Ya, the question however is..... Will salt already have the majority of its price built in when the flippening happens?
Will its price already be built in for the most part?
BCH is a trap, it'll be dumped, alts will be stronk, XMR, VTC, ETH, OMG, all cheap right now and consolidating price
You alties and your "flippening" are so cute.
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
Oh Sweeties, don't you have to be getting ready for Junior High?

Like a little tiny kitten ferociously attacking someones little toe while it obviously sees itslef as a lion in the Serengeti taking down a wildebeast.
