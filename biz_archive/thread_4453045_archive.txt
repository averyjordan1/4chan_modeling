Is Eth mooning good for alts?
Literally nothing is "good" for alts, just put a bunch of alt names on a wall and throw darts to decide what to buy, it's about as effective a strategy as anything else.
unlike btc, when eth moons it usually pulls its shitty erc-20 tokens up with it to some degree
People will be dumping alts to join on ethereum's moon mission.
