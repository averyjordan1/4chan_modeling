You mean to tell me if I long 1 bitcoin at 100x leverage I would have 2 bitcoins if bitcoin goes up 1%?
minus 15% fees
BTC goes down 2% mid day at 100x leverage>Liquidated right before the moon mission begins.
isn't 100x lev on BitMex more like 0.25% for liquidation?
x has 50% liquidation2x has 33% liquidation10x has 9% liquidation50x has 1.5% liquidation100x has 0.5% liquidation
that sounds too easy

If it goes the other way even a little bit you get absolutely fucked, specially if you get greedy.
Plus, you gotta pay the interests/fees.
bitmex funding works in a way that the funding fees are given to the less crowded side of the trade, and you only pay fees for orders if they are market orders.
you gain an inverse fee from the market buyer if you place a limit order.
in short, if you aren't an impatient weak handed pleb you can do really well there.
protip: use tiny amounts and martingale
