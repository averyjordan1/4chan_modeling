I wouldn't spend a penny on bitcoin until you start to see some sign of a steady upward slope for at least 48hrs straight.
Pic related is a (rough) peak-based slope.

Keep buying your bcash scam.

Screencap this.
>muh correction
Get ready for the storm of pink pepes from idiots who bought BTC at $6 or $5k in the coming days as it drops to $4k or lower.
This is a chain-reaction of selling, triggering stop-loss orders one after the other, causing BTC to crash who knows how far.
Smart investors focus on avoiding losses rather than trying to predict and bet on gains.
I have not lost ANY money investing because I follow this.
Attempting to discern trends from one day of data.
Stay poor, bch idiot.
