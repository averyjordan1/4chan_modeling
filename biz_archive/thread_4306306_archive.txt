That feeling when it's been an entire hour since a block was mined...
y-YEAH WELL SAY THAT AGAIN IN 2 YEARS ASSHOLE

This is pretty bad.
Holy shit, coming up on 2 hours with only 2 blocks mined.This is not money for normies.
This is not even a 'store of value'.
BTC why are you stabbing yourself
Reminder: it's going to be an entire week before bitcoin block difficulty is re-adjusted.Until miners return, the only transactions that are going to get confirmed in the next week are going to have extremely high fees.BTC is so fucked right now.https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty
Miners will come back once BCH retargets, which at this hash rate would be in a bit over 30 hours.
ONLY TWO BLOCKS IN THE LAST TWO HOURS
If BCH stays high value, then BTC is only going to be worth mining based on the transaction fees.
You're basically going to have to cut off your left nut in order to make a single transaction.
I'm calling it now.
Screencap this.Before the next difficulty adjustment, we are going to see blocks where the mining fees are LARGER than the block reward (12.5 BTC).Until now, no block has ever had mining fees making the majority of the reward.
If you want out of bitcoin right now, you had better pay 1000 satoshi/byte just to make sure.
Don't get stuck holding your dick just because you cheaped out on tx fees.
Lol you poor fags are worried about paying $15 for a transaction xD
HERE WE GO - SEVEN BITCOINS IN TX FEES IN THE LAST BLOCK
guys fuck poor people amirite?
!Truly Satoshi's vision.
