NEO downed to 42 from 48.
Will it up to 50 today ?
The same guy who tweeted to make the price go up liked this tweet earlier today:https://twitter.com/Dogsbreakfast75/status/931651627265568768
What do you mean to make the price go up ?I'm asking.
He's the one who tweeted the announcement in 3 days message on twitter which caused the price jump.
Also if you rearrange my ID it says WOke
I hope so, because I fucking bought at 48.
And I'm not fucking selling.
I'm going to bed holding.
God bless me for these gains I'm about to receive.
ATH is 50 and you buy in at 48?
Are you kidding me?
You'll be fine anon, this shit has hit reversal, will probably be $60-70 as the announcement drops.
Then it's either mega moon or dump, lol.
What time is the announcement?
ATH in sats is much higher>Thinking in fiat>Pro trader
He hasn't heard of buy the rumour sell the news Every pajeet and their mom will offload before the announcement.
Thinking in sats>Not realizing change of true value>Being this dilusional
delusional*
Also if you rearrange my ID it says WOkeActually it says WOZek, Wojak's retarded brother.
Investor Warning: Major NEO Redflagshttps://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/major-neo-redflags/
 gambling
that would worry me if it was a burger coin but this is china.
chinks always doing shady shit with money
also nice QTUM tipjar thats not suspicious at all
This is my major problem with NEO, what's the point of it being a cryptocurrency even?
It's already centralized and if it ever gets big enough the Chinese gov will nationalize it.
It may be useful just like any software but it will incredibly controlled.
Not saying it won't moon though, for people who want to make more BTC.
Just suprised westerners are excited about this.
