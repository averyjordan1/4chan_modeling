Over the past few months I've learned a few things about trading cryptos the hard way.None of this is new, but I had to learn for myself the hard way before having it stick.Feel free to critique or add something to what I'm sharing.>Trade rumors, sell newsIf you don't get in early, wait for the post-news dump and make gains on the rebound.Also, think about what everyone else is going to do in a situation (inexperienced normies) and capitalize on it.>Never go all in, nothing is ever a sure thingUnless your portfolio is .
Take big risks while you can afford it.>Learn your exchanges inside and out (types of orders, fee structure, withdraw hurdles, etc)>Learn to read charts.>Don't panicSmall dips are always going to happen, so learn to enjoy the roller coaster ride.
nice thread.Let me add:>Learn to detect past strong support and resistance, and use them as objectives>Use stop-loss, mental or physical, but learn to cut the losses
