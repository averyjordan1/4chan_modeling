FUCK.
I've got work in 1 hour.
Do I hold my POWR or sell now?I'm also holding QSP and feel the same about that.
sell it for lgd right the fuck now
are you retarded?
SELL.
QSP especially.
Christ man wanna hold bags?
Guess what happens when the hype is over and biz sells most of their bags?
Thats right: FUD fest and POWR turns into a meme of Jemme getting Blacked 30 times a day.your call anon
Eh, I can't see it dropping below 9 cents again.
Think that's it's home.
/biz/ doesn't have enough influence to raise or lower any of these coins.
If you don't like money then sell your powr
HOLD POWR and you might not have to work anymore
