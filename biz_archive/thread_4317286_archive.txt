Goodness me what a day what a day
Can you afford it?
what kind of piss poor exchange would even let you sell this far down the order book without a fat finger warning
Bitstamp basically tells you "DON'T FUCKING DO THIS YOU FUCK" when you try to place an order 20% over or under the market price.
27208 USDTSo you are telling me you just sold at market price?
Cool story, call me when you place an order that eats the whole order book.
I ignored the under 5% market price warningEverything happened so fast one second we were $2400 next second $1700
I've walked away $2500 AUD up so I guess I can afford itI'm brave, stupid and luckyI worry if I'm going to make it with that combination
am i misunderstanding?
$15 * 20.52 = $307.80 when it should have been $1326.08 * 20.52 = $27,211.16so a loss of $26,903why did you title it $5k mistake instead of $26.9k mistake?
It says it filled at 1326, not at 15
I sold at 10% once by accidentall happened so fast
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
