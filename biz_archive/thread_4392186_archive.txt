Stop trading crypto
Get professional help.
You have a gambling addiction.
portfolio down 80%You won't have a problem for much longer if you keep doing what you're doing.
Well how about you start doing the exact opposite trades youâ€™d actually do and get RICH :-D
do what you want
just buy btc and if you really want to risk 1 or 2 alts and FUCKING HOLD IT.you're clearly not good enough to day trade.
practice makes perfect bro.
Create a trading plan and STICK TO IT.
I trade forex and everytime ive lost money is because i dont stick to my trading plan.
...
It's just virtual imaginary money.
If you did not earn it by every day manual work, then it does not matter if you lose it.
It was not real anyway.
You're obviously not good at day trading.
Give up and do some shitty wageslaving job until you're 60.
