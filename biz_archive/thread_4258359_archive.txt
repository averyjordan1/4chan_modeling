Answering questions about Bitcoin and Canadian banking.
Breadcrumb:The Royal Canadian Mint has bought Bitcoin with 100M tethers in the last month.
bank of bitcoin(CAD withdrawls), or for crypto transactions?
When does BTC hit 10k?
Canadian pesos?
No taxes when
yay, more rich chinks sending their families to pozronto and vancouver, shitting up our cities, provinces, and country
Right now they're just getting their feet wet.A few exchanges have had large premiums for CAD/BTC.I doubt things will ever get that comfy.
Interesting changes are ahead though.
so they're gonna help cryptotax?any specifics?is Canadian banking already in the mining schene, or will they just be starting?
lol schene, scene*
It already did.
No mining, but not exactly just starting either.The Canadian finance sector (like many others) were shocked by Trump's election win and it has changed some variables.It's not just Canada though, lots of countries don't want to be left out.
Everyone can see change is coming.
"Shocked" by trump's win.
Cuck.
Do you have a bull for your girlfriend bankerleaf?
Are you even white?
I'm not saying I was, but you'd be fooling yourself if you don't think big institutions had a lot riding on "her turn".
So Canada dumped their gold bags on China and Russia?
Lmao if true
Do you sense that the Mint is betting squarely on BTC, or are they also diversifying across some of the other primary cryptos?
If government is onboard, what's with the issues people are having linking bank accounts other than RBC to exchanges to transfer money?
I'm with RBC so I'm not getting cuck'd
They don't care about the technology so alts aren't a big concern.They're not buying because they want you to have any.
has trudeu kicked the UN out of his wifes bedroom yet?
What's the tax plan for it?
Appreciate the insight, thanks.
