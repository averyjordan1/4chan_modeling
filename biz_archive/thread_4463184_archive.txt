Feels good going in +.
It will crash hard today.
dont be too greedy
i woke up and sold it at 8k then did some rebuys and shit and now quit for good
I just sold as well.nice little profit on the day though
Sold as well, first bought in at 2.4K on Binance a while back with some swing trades so very happy.
In NEO for the next few hours but might get back in POWR again tomorrow depending on the price.
Smart move.
