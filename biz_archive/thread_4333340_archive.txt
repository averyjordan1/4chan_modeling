Seriously want to know your thoughts, Bitcoin Cash was a meme coin when it first dropped.
But look at what happened.
Maybe Bitcoin Gold could explore over night as well?
Yeah dead afBought at 0.05 missed to sell at 0.09, finally sold at 0.07 today
but its only been traded for one day (today) just like Bitcoin Cash did when it first released.
Did you read my top comment?
