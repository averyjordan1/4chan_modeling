I'm down so FUCKING much on LINK and REQ it's not even funny to post JUST memes about it.What the fuck do I do now, realistically?
These shitters don't show any signs of recovering short-term and I don't want to sell at a loss unless it's a near guaranteed gainer like NEO, which I'm not sure has any more juice left.How the FUCK do I recover?
BUY NEO NOW
Buy real coins.
NEO not any juice left?
LMAOIf the news is real you will see some serious gains that you've never seen before.
You have no choice but to hold.
Itâ€™s boring and stressful, but do it pussy.

You should read up on the tulip bulb mania in Holland (1600s) before you continue speculating in cryptos.
Speculative manias are as old as civilization.
