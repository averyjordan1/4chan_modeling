BTC seems like its stagnating and lots its hype.
Is there any reason to buy BTC?
There's nothing in the news that will boost its price like in the past weeks.
There is absolutely no reason to buy BTC at all, except if you're fed up with being a poorfag.
Then I'd go all in on BTC.Why?Because it is the KING.
It will stay the KING.
Forever.
Okay nothing your post gave me a logical reason to buy it though.
I think the only thing holding it together is the possibility of it being listed on the CME exchange as BTC futures, if they get denied from all this shitstorm between the core devs not getting their shit together and the temper tantrum that ensued between BCH we may see it go back to prices we saw in early May.
Try again.
Try talking to me and using your brain instead of posting a meme pic.
I am asking for tangible reasons to still invest in bitcoin when it currently seems stagnant.
This time its different, there's a new kid on the block from its hardfork that became its nemesis.
Normies thinking BTC is just a non stop free money train with no brakes
