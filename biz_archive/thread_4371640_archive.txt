Anyone here familiar with investing in oil well projects?
Is this a good time to get involved in the oil market?
What are some aspects I should investigate when choosing a project to buy a stake in?
Idk but US crude oil export is mooning
All I know is that us lazy, ignorant passive investors don't have much reason to give it a second thought: https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGPMLP.pdf
yes.
your question is vague desu.
are you drilling new wells?
taking over old ones?
What is this coin?
OP, the secret to oil is war and geopolitics
Fuck no there is so much oil companies out of business right now the first contract that pops up they will provide dirt cheap wells and service
OilCoin bro
There are so many factors.
Company can be upstream only, or maybe they are downstream/midstream/disposal/recycling etc.
and also there are site specific conditions and technical details that affect extraction cost that a company will probably not disclose all of which hinges on a market that's hyper sensitive to whichever country decides to shit the bed (i.e.
oil price peaked when ISIS was at its peak)I only know this from secondhand conversation with dozens of guys in the petrol business, maybe some /biz/tard out there is more knowledgeable than me
