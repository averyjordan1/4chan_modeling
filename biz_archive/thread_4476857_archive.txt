I'm sick of seeing my /biz/bros getting scammed by this guy.Where can I find someone to "talk" to Pravik Pajeet?
I have some XMR to spend...
good luck, the guy is practically a ghost, floating in and out of ICOs like a fuckin Crypto Casper
Pajeet was thought to be killed in an airstrike after causing a market crash on Obsidian with an orchestrated mass dump in October.
Apparently he has been giving insider legal advice as the lawyer to Confido as well.
When will it stop?
I personally know Pravik Pajeet.
He worked very hard to get to where he is now.
He was born an untouchable in India, yet today everyone wants a piece of him.Mr.
Pajeet has run many scams and confido might just be his most profitable yet.
Crypto crimes aside, I heard he was also behind the Vegas shooting and the killing of Jesus.
deepweb has become a fbi honeypot.
If you want him gone, offer your local desperate crackhead some money to do it.
Buy his coin!!
many say he IS a ghost
Careful, anon.
Pravik Pajeet has deep, powerful connections.
It's how he keeps getting away with everything.
