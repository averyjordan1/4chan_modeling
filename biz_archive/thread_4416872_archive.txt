IOTA DESTROYED.
NEXT TARGET DASH AND LITECOINDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA HONGFEI BABY

http://rmbtheory.com/china-allowing-icos-neo/ if this is true $50-100 easy
my pink ID confirms it

Be real man stop your shilling, they are allowing NEO but not QTUM?
Wake up fool.
if it dumps, doubt it will be before the news
I tried to tell you guys both about IOTA and NEO, the threads got less than 5 replies.
if thats true, then $ 100 pretty much confirmedeven Dash is 400 $ coinChina is huge business area, i think NEO is much bigger than Dashso then $ 100 NEO would be very low, then we have to speak about at least $ 200 - $ 300 NEO
Getting very close to BFX ath, if that breaks this is going to go insane.
Much like the very first FOMO for NEO
even Dash is 400 $ coinThat's because there's only 7,694,472 DASH you retard.
There's 65,000,000 NEO in supply right now
snagged it at .00466 in those seconds that it dropped
NEO 100$ before the end of the year400-500$ by December 2018
So much shill lololol baka
Why does anyone buy Qtum?
Serious question.
What do you think will happen with Iota in next few days?
easily $1.50 - $1.60, then moon in december
Profit taking and return to 0.40
tfw to late for some good gains again.If i buy now it well get dumped anyway.
