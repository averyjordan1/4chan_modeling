>not using dynamic linear models to determine regression shrinkage on leveraged bitcoin future swaps while minimizing volatility using a ergodic markov model with multivariate kernel smoothing
fag
not just buying low and selling high with no fucks given about TA
yu sound smrt, tell us who will win, bitcoin btc or bitcoin bch
regretion shrinkageWhy the fuck?
Just estimate the actual price instead of trying to search for fluctuation in various hikups>Minimizing volatility :Why do you want to smooth somthing already modeled up?
You can't minimize volatility of the coin unless you are a biiiig whale.
You can try to predict it, but smoothing is is useless.
not bombasting
Implying you can use linear models to project variable dependent movements in valuation

Has this actually worked for you?
I'm bleeding money
it works if you know what the real emotions behind the posts are.
Should be painfully obvious.
Are we the picture for not doing that stuff?
