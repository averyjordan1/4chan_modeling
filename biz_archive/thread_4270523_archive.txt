Don't miss the moon....
I had $6k in this, was so pissed every time someone down sold some shitdick amount to make my stack lose half it's value in Blockfolio.
It's fine now
oh no pajeet that sounds terrible.
soon you'll be able to buy two shitting streets though and all will be well in mumbai yet aye gain and aye gain.
like tears in the rain.
aye gain and aye gain.
It seems all shitcoins only go up when bittrex rumors start.
Is it really this easy to manipulate the pajeet horde?
whatever happened to that shitcoin?
I missed the ICO although I was able to make it to the whitelist.Is it still not listed on any fucking exchange?
I would be pretty mad if I was holding any cause they didnt announce that they would cuck their investors that hard before the ICO, like Wanchain did it for example...
the cindicator jews are holding off releasing their token for "safety" concerns.
also they did't want to release before the fork for obvious reasons.
by "safety" they're probably referring to legal issues regarding ico regulations and the gray area of their token; they don't want to have to return funds to ico investors or face prosecution.
now they're hinting that they'll list on bittrex soon.
