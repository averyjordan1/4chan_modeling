RLC - Bittrex
Don't fucking miss it, do you want this Lambo or not?
Still don't get why this coin is so undervalued.
I expect a full moon mission this week.
I expect a full moon mission this week.Why?
What's different this week compared to last week or the week before?
I'm strapped the fuck in right now.
Almost full position into it.
I fully know this coin will explode in the next week.
Because the final version won't be ready before few years years but it's absolutely a great choice.Also, another moon mission for you guys.LMC - Bittrex
Nothing, we expecting it each week, like all the shitcoins
Riding this pump and then putting everything in Modum, im gonna make it anons and you?
Tonight I'm generous.NULS - BinanceBullish chart, in the next few days the competition will end but before then there will be a p&d to get more points for the competition.
RCN is about to pop now.
RCNNaaaah, Ripio isn't ripe yet.
I know it fucked up a lot of "investors" considering how low it dipped but there are no signs of a moon mission yet.My picks for the short term, as I said, are RLC and LMC.
This project is miles ahead of GNT in terms of development.
Their team is a whole lot better as well.
I am expecting this coin to explode any moment now.
At least reach a similar MC to GNT in the next few months.
