Hi guys.Remember, BCH has a hardfork on the 13th of this month which should (based on hardforks on Bitcoin (apart from the ones that never happen)) cause a significant correction.Furthermore, CME futures are launching the first wave of their Bitcoin futures program in December of this year.
CME futures is the biggest future market in the world.I am bullish on BCH until the fork.
After that, I will be bullish on BTC because of the CME futures.

 That's not how the futures market works… They are not buying the underlying.
It's a market independent of the underlying and nobody who is short/long is actually maintaining possession of the underlying.
Futures Respond to the price of the underlying, not vice versa… Learn a bit about how markets work before you comment.
CME will short bitcoin into the ground.
-20% everydayyes lad, CME buys all the corn in the world so they can short corn, also pigs.
There will be no pork left soon, they killed them all.
