"At its core a prediction market does two things - it allows to create predictive assets (tokens that represent a specific real world even and which will have a guaranteed value of 1 unit if this outcome happens - 0 otherwise) and second the trading of those assets.
Since Nucleus it will be a open platform those assets can be traded on any exchange (decentralized exchanges, centralised exchanges or even services like “Shapeshift”).
However - predictive assets have some properties which make some market mechanisms more effective - like the use of automated market makers that guarantee to provide liquidity.
Those mechanisms will be the focus of the Corethum team but will actively contribute to making predictive assets tradable on many places.
