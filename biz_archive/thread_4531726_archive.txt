Hey /bizI'm a little confused with trademark registration for goods and services.If I would like to sell merch in the future, but will most likely outsource the production, do I still need to register in that class?e.g.
'Bags adapted for laptops'Do I need to register for 'bags adapted for laptops' if I give another company, whose business is making laptop bags for other companies, my logo to print (and then I presumably sell the bags)?
Please help meThere are enough frogs
you need to register in whatever classes you want it for, get a lawyer to do it it isn't straightforward
Go to trademarkia.
