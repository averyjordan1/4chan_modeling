Buy Stellar Lumens at the dip while you can biz.
570 was high yesterday, were breaching 600 today, especially with Bitcoin dropping like a rock.
BTC dropping>XLM rising>you win nothingWhy investing in something you will have no net USD gain in?
Especially for currencies where dollar pairs exist?
In.
Partnership with Paypal coming soon.
Not sure I follow you?
XLM rising and Bitcoin falling means you can then buy more Bitcoin when you sell XLM... That is a good thing...
There's also no tether pair with XLM.
Are you thinking of XRP?
Source?
Been thinking about getting into this one.

Confirmed partnership with PayPal
There is USDT/STR on poloniex.My point was, if the BTC/USD price falls, and the XLM/BTC price rises, your dollar net worth stays roughly the same, you would not gain more than just selling BTC and buying back later, of course many people here follow the philosophy that they neglect USD gains and just try to accumulate more BTC.
But with the unstable situation we have right now I prefer selling BTC for USD, since a major BTC crash would most likely take everything else with it.
*gain more THAN by just selling ...sorry
That logic presumes that BTC will stay down.
If that's the case, you shouldn't be in cryptos at all.
BTC will continue to go down for today and hell, maybe even the next 2-3 days, but we all know that there's one thing Bitcoin does well and that's go up.
So buying more Bitcoin is always a good thing.
It should be why everyone is here.
