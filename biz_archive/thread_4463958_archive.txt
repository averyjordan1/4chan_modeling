Why do people give a shit what this Tiki slowjak says?
He's a complete fucking moron and a pump and dumper, he's just hyper-shilling everything to sell off his bags.
He said "Buy Bitcoin Cash up to $1400!"
which just shows how much of a failure he really is and he didn't even manage to get it up above that price.
Like honestly, what do you expect to happen when he picks a coin?
It maybe MIGHT go up ~20% but just like with Chainlink Sibos and Ripple swell and Digibyte winning that competition, it will tank immediately after because there will be no rumours.
Why the fuck are so many people fussed out about what he says when you could easily instead just make 20% doing basic technical analysis instead of getting $0.5 per post?
who's this bald boi ?
Do you think Teeka uses his mad crypto gainz to pay a couple of 6ft tall blonde goddessess to oil their tight naked bodies from head to toe until they glisten like honey and then drag their wet, oiled up cunts, freshly shaved over his perfectly shaved head until it too is glistening from oil and pussy juice?Or do you think he's more of a wax, chains and whips guy?
Digibyte didn't win.

Brilliant.
In my country this dude would be heavily racism'd to death.
No joke.
He's just a visionary, it can't be helped.
