Place your bets.
A shit ton of normies have bought bitcoin since the fork, which means they won't get split money.
BCash would have succeeded if it had done so right out of the gate, but should a flippening actually happen it would destroy crypto for years as normies would have no idea what was happening.
Bch
destroy crypto for years as normies would have no idea what was happeningLike normies aren't losing all their money everytime they buy a stock market peak.
That was meant to be a quote.
we are still in the infancy of crypto, I don't own either so with an unbiased opinion I'd say it has to be bch.
But who knows if another fork doesn't eventually happen and surpass both.
The technology is also in it's infancy.
BCH.
It will be pretty ugly for BTC tomorrow, crashing down and burning.
Don't be on the losing side and buy BCH!
Parity for some time until BCH goes pastMeanwhile ETH destroys everything
more time to accumulatefuck me then i REALLY hope the flippening happens
I just found out that i have wroth couple of dons bch.
The question is does bitcoin cash use same adresses as bitcoin wallets, I dont seem to find different wallet addresses for bch altogethjer?
Please be patient I have autism
Yes, the addresses are the same.
If you were in BTC before August, you were then in BCH after the fork.
The trouble is a shit ton of money has poured into each of BTC and BCH separately since the fork.
The longer we go without a flippening, the more BCH will be functionally an altcoin.
Stock market is hitting record almost daily thanks to our God Emperor.
BTC about to get fucked in the ass.
er, these slow declines are always how the next boom happens.
i dont see your point.
The point is>move btc to bch/eth/usd>stop buying new btc>allow market to naturally correct>buy cheap btcWe'd be riding this wave already if it weren't for the enormous normie influx.
Jan 2018 BCH will be more expensive than BTC, I'm guessing 10k vs 1k..
