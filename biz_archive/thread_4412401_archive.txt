If Finex is printing imaginary money (Tether), why would they do it on the blockchain where everyone can see it when they can just increment a number in their accounts database and everyone would be non the wiser?Can you Tether conspiracy theorists answer this one?
so why is op alone up in here?really makes you think.
tether fudsters are sub 5 digits portfolio untermensch insect plebs.
I personally don't know.
I think even if the tether shit was real, the huge money folks like Morgan Stanley, CME group etc simply won't let it fail.
It's WAY too much money for them to lose it.
The whole too big to fail thing and all.
Tether is backed by real money, stop being a little beta bitch conspiracy theorist.
it's an actual crypto token you mong, it's on a public blockchainwhat they do is print the new tethers, pump btc then cash out a portion into real fiat to put back into the tether account in taiwan.
so when the pump fails they are going to be fucked, that's when the house of cards will fall.
