N-NO THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!
IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS!!
Well, a lot of people got kinda JUSTed if they're going to wait for next BTC diff adjustment to do this.BCH will win in the end though, just depends on how safe they play it.
And considering how far back they let BCH fall without spending anything significant in absorbing sell pressure (just buy gargantuan buy walls that are never reached), I'd say they're playing it pretty safe.They might have just let it recede to soften the blow of the bitmex dump, though, and were originally planning to move ahead faster, but who knows.A lot of people don't know much about how invested these guys are in making it succeed, as well as how much better positioned they are to make it succeed than their opponents are to make it fail.
I fear this will cause weak hands to sell at a loss if they wait until "the ideal moment".
WTF is going on?
im convinced the dump already happened when it hit peak.
It would also explain some of the very funky books during the crash.
They will pay out when its not worth much so they can keep the majority for themselves.
GET IN BITBAY NKW THIS IS JUST THE PREPUMP
