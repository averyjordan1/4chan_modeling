COSS charging 200,000 COSS tokens now for new coin/token listings on their exchange.Is this smart or dumb?
indicative of huge listing interest?
or greed?
at current price it amounts to like ~$15,000 USD worth of COSS, how does that compare to listing fees by other exchanges?
That's nothing.
ICOs get at least 10m dollars nowadays.
Sure, ya I'm not saying it's a huge amount for an ICO, just curious more on how it compares to other exchange fee requirements for new listings.Basically is this standard?
greedy?
good sign that COSS might be getting more interest from ICOs wanting their coins listed?
Big exchanges are not taking any money for listing(or not publishing this at least).
I only know about Cryptopia taking 5 mil DOT(oh god, that is 5 BTC) for listing.
$15k is less compared to it, but I guess nobody needs it even for that price.
They have interest from 500 coins so far, according to slackAlso they will be using the coins to get exclusive ICOs on the platform and to pay for services (since many services want to be paid in coss)Basically this is bullish as fuck because it means people actually have confidence in this token I know Binance ask for $50k, which an ICO team leaked a while back
interesting, thanksi suppose i really should be monitoring slack channels for anything im holding
Definitely a good sign as it will add buying pressure to the coss token, ESPECIALLY if the exchange starts to get big (prediction:the ICO trading competitions will definitely entice some whales over).I’m happy I’m in position now, only 80k coss but there is so much room to 10x and then 100x
Too much effort, I just check biz.
That's, what, $15?
Yeah pretty much.
Hey man I'm new to this whole exchange stuff could you help me out?
I'll pay you $10,000 if you can get me 200,000 COSS tokens.
Should be a good profit oppprtunity for you and I won't have to figure out all this shit.
Deal?
BIG NEWS in the slack
Fuarrrrrrrrrrrk
