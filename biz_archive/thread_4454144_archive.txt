Ok /biz/, I know some of you have lost out from Confido, but here's your shot at redeeming yourself from your loss.
ICO is finished, which is bad and their hard cap of $170k was reached.
Keep an eye for this gem on Etherdelta on December 1st, if you want to make your gains back.
Fair warning to all of you, because some of you are okay.
Now I give back to the community.
As always DYOR, but let us make le gainz for the winter.
Buying this for 2x, you can still make profit.On their website, they have the ICO price.Remember Confido?
It did a 7X in just an hour of trading.
Watch out for this gem on EtherDelta.
I hope you all make it.Website: https://payfair.io/
