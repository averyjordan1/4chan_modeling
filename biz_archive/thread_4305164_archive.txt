Bitcoin price is only governed by 1 economic law:The supply and demand of drugs and illegal wares.
Thats why Bitcoin price doesnt tank when an entire country like Vietnam bans it.
Thats why it doesnt tank when Russia, China and India say they will regulate it.Litterally only drug addicts and drug dealers matter.
And everyone is getting very high at the moment.
Drug dealers use monero.

I joined the Bitcoin train @ 1600$ because you shilled it to me.
Then I sold @ 2400 after I heard that India was regulating Bitcoin.I thought bad news=lower price.
But Bitcoin doesnt give a shit.
Everyone bans/regulates it but the price keeps going up.It doesnt make any sense.
Why is Bitcoin going up % in 1 year with all this bad news?
*1000%
why do you think illegalization is bad news?
things like gold and bitcoin thrive on "bad news"
bitcoin thrive on "bad news"How?
How is bad news good?Im used to trading stocks, if there is any small bad news the stock tanks 3-5% the same day!
Your BTC is fucked when markets start employing alts for one very legitimate reason: BTC TRANSACTION FEES ARE FUCKING HUGE
gold stocks go up when stock market goes down
Are you fucking telling me gold and bitcoin are treated in the same way?If so put a fucking bullet in my head!
Bitcoin is a extremely high risk product and gold is an extremely safe product.
