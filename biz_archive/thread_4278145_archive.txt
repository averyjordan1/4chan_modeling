Fiat currency is tulip mania.
Everyone is scrambling to get these fiat currency papers that mean nothing, you can't exchange them for anything; they're not even coupons.
People just accept them as payment.That's exactly the same as Bitcoin.
Except Bitcoin has the ability to be an advertised exchange with other limitless possibilities, itâ€™s like a person crying Amazon will never be boarders because people want to own the physical books they read, or CDs will always be around because nobody is going to be a digital song
Have you poor cunts figured out that selling BTC now and rebuying at 5k will make you Jew-rich yet??
Bitcoin is like having a gun in case of tyranny.
If Socialism gains traction in America you put your money in Bitcoin and collectively not pay taxes.This is why a china coin will never be successful.
