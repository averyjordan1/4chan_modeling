can someone please explain how AA didnt win it all
Because 8s made a set on 888 xd
Because the initial stack of AA was lower than two other stacks.
It's called split pot.
If you have one chip and other guys have both one thousand chips each you can maximum win 3 chips, not 2001.
sidepot?
retard
is this the new cryptoanna meme?
