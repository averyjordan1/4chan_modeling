Any Canadians here?
I'm new to coins and would like to deposit and withdraw from/to from my bank account.
I don't want my account to get closed though.
How to proceed?
Open somewhere else where it is allowed.Look you live in Canada and there is only so many banks there but literally over 11,000 banks to try at.
Ask before opening account there.You tried 1 so there is still 10,999 banks to try
