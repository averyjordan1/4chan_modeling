Always scared of shorting Bitcoin, is anybody else opening a position here?
It's gonna fall pretty far post fork, but always a matter of personal risk tolerance
not shorting but i'm getting the hell out of btc
Fork is cancelled if you didn't already know.
im looking to short this cocksucker and ride it hard all down to 6K.
Made an error on the chart but Target 2 for me is 5640$
