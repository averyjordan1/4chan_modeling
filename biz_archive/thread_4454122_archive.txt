Kinda new to crypto but done my own research the past weeksThinking of tossing $1000 at the following coinsXMRWTCVTCPWRIOTAWill I make it or get justed?
Why not LINK OP?
XMR, everything else is a shitcoin
XMRyes>WTCok>VTCtestbed for new tech, get out after release of whatever they are working on>PWRcareful of pump>IOTAwill never work
Not terrible.
Needs BTC though.
Go POWR.
You're an idiot.
So are you.>IOTA>>VTCI'd prefer POWR desu
IOTA coming to bittrex soon (90% certain).
Quite a safe bet in other words.Source: another thread that went into the page source code for the Bittrex wallet.
Saw it with my own eyes.
Powr is only rising due to PBC pnd anticipation
IOTA is better than XMRXMR is better than NEONEO is better than VTCVTC is better than WTCWTC is better than PWRand PWR is better than IOTAHope this clears things up desu
Prove it, cunt.
XMR - goodWTC - decentVTC - unsurePWR - it's gonna dump hardIOTA - useless
50% BTC15% ETH15% ZEC10% XMR10% 2 shitcoins of your choice / pump and dump fun to get your feet wet
xmr
The only coin that's worth it in your list is IOTA for long-term
not if u buy nuls
XMR is already $130, he can make more profits by investing in a smaller coin such as POWRLearn to market.
I bet you were saying the same thing about BTC, huh?I'm about value, not shittokens, sorry faggot

LINK fud is getting smarter
Do NOT diversify with such a small amount of money.
Just go all in on a coin that you are at least 95% confident will go up in whatever time-span you're looking for.
