I have genuinely convinced myself that Ark will reach $100 for sure, and the big question is whether it gets all the way to $1,000.I run the faucet an average of 20 times per day, sometimes setting alarms in the middle of the night, telling myself it will be worth at least a buck per roll eventually.I liquidated all of my gift cards and converted them to cash, then ETH, then Ark.A gay friend of mine once offered $2k to blow me while drunk.
I turned him down because I'm straight.
I've been reconsidering.
"$2k of Ark now?
That will be worth at least $100k by EOY 2018!
Who in their right mind would turn down a $00k bj?"Help.
Thats the spirit brother, 1000$ ark eoy 2019
Noooo.
I need some realism, man.
$100,000 ARK EOD
Gay for Ark.
Future looks bright
You're going to make me go gay.
:'(
Not letting a guy suck you off for 2k.
What are you?
gay?
Wow, you could've been set for life by giving just a single blow job but instead you turned it down due to your illusion of being straight.
You deserve to fail you fat piece of shit
I'm skellytier desu.And it was to receive a bj, not give one
LINK $22 by EOY 2018 (around Ripple's current marketcap I believe)This will make me a millionaire in GBP after tax
I've been doing shit like this too.
I'm obsessed and completely convinced we'll see $100+ within the next 6-12 months.
I'm genuinely glad to hear I'm not the only one, even though I don't think it's healthy for either of us
It's definitely not, but maybe it will pay off.
I'm trying to liquidate everything so I won't feel regret later when it booms.
