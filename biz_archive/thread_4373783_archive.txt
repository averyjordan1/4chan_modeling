Turned $10k into $1k trading shitcoins on BittrexLost $12k on COSS and Loopring
Forgot password to wallet with 13 btc on it.
Went from 8 btc to 5 through october.
Now im at 6.4 from taking advantage of the btc crash.
Sent 0.03 BTC to wrong address using metamask shapeshift.Lost 12k USD margin trading during China FUD.
lost like $20k in the last month due to buying at ATH.Lesson learned> don't trade more than 3% of your stack.
If the ATH purchases were due to you trying to "Catch the wave up" then try to avoid that.
It is usually pump and dump designed to suck people in.
tierioncould've sold at x3, but thought it could go higher.
Now I'm down almost 50% from the ICO price>LATokenPut $1500 into the ICO, immediately got JUSTd loosing 1/3Dumped my ZRX that I bought for 0.00055 eth for this shit and airswap>Got airswappedstill managed to exit losing only a hundred bux though>Was on chainlink whitelist, but thougth it was a meme>knew about OMG way before the ICO, never invested in it>Wrote in my trading notepad that I should dump all my alts for btc and wait for the BTG hardfork, back when it was like $3k>didn't do itEverything I do since the August is one giant JUST.
Not all of us are gonna make it bros.also>Shorted bitcoin yesterday after the chink mining news right at the fucking bottom.thank god I closed the short early, so it wasn't that big of a fuckupWhat I've learned from all of this - don't marry a shitcoin and don't be afraid of selling at a loss when the ship starts tanking.
I'm thinkg of dumping all my bags at a loss now and start from scratch.
What do you think, is that a good idea ?
or should I just continue hodling like a retard I am ?
All BTC fags are gonna just hard and kill themselves in a couple of weeks, it will be glorious.
bought a graphic card with 10 bitcoins many years ago, and spent another 3 or 4 bitcoins on other random computer parts Funny thing is i had bought bitcoin to leave the keys in a safe and forget about it for many years, but i really needed the cash so i spent my btc on it, telling myself i'll buy back when i get the money.
When i had the funds to buy it back, it had gone up too much, and i kept waiting for a dip to buy inAll that waiting is what made me lose potentially 70-80k in btc today
bought eth at athdidnt sell so didnt lose>almost just
still all in
holy shit.
this will go to zero, my friend.
