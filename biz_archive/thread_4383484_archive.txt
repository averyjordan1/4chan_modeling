I just noticed the price of Bitcoin and I want to FUCKING SELL.How do I sell my Bitcoin in the quickest/ easiest way possible?
Localbitcoins, find an atm
Why would you sell, we're about to moon to 10k!
>owns Butts>doesn't know how to sell them
Hope you have them on exchange because otherwise you won't be able to sell them due to the long transaction times.
Good luck.
There's no ATMs in my first world country by the looks.
Lots of adverts for people buying Bitcoins, paying via bank transfer.
This is the way to go, right?I want my money out now.
Then I'll piss around with a fraction of it in the weenie e-coin markets and learn how they work.
- Register an email- Register on Bitfinex with this email- Transfer your BTC to this new Bitfinex account- Sell the BTCYou now hold USDT on Bitfinex and have time to find ATM, localbitcoin-partner or to organize Bitfinex verfication to withdraw $ with wire-transfer.To sell BTC as soon as you found ATM/localbitcoin, simply buy BTC again and transfer directly from Bitfinex (possible without verification).
I'm not American, is Bitfinex supported in UK?
I don't know.
I'm Swiss.
But in UK you should have no problem at all to find someone on localbitcoin.Your problem is, if you don't have them already on an exchange:see here:https://blockchain.info/de/charts/avg-confirmation-time?timespan=30daysand here:https://blockchain.info/de/unconfirmed-transactionsBut it seems to be better than two days ago so transfer them to an exchange, then you can sell.
