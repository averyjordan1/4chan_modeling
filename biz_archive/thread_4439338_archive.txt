Daily reminder that no matter how much you've lost, as long as you remain in crypto, you are going to make it.
Daily reminder that crypto represents the largest transfer of wealth in human history, and it hasn't even started yet.
Anon, you haven't discovered a cheat code.
You've discovered the future of the human race.
Yes, you are early enough.
Yes, you will make it.
Yes, you will look back on the pain of your losses and feel real, genuine pride that you made it through.
Daily reminder to look forward, not back.
Don't give up, don't opt out.
A lot of you haven't known enough goodness to believe it can happen to you.
I'm here to tell you that it can.
And it will.
Your worst mistakes will be nothing more than pebbles strewn along the beach that will be your life.
And your children's life.
And their children's life, too.
You are going to make it.
Th-thanks anon.
Y-you too.
