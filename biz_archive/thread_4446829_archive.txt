I'm holding eth Ltc and BTC.
I'd like to add one more coin.
Is XMR a solid pick?
I like ark but they don't even have working product yet.
What about IOTA?
XMR king of privacy coins.
IOTA has big potential with 0 fees and new blockchain.
XMR less risk.
Have a few hodls and keep a smaller amount "liquid" for trading, join a group like this one https://discord.gg/suDgMP
