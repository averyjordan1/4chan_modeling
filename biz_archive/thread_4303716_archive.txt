Look faggots, I'm trying to save my income with gold and silver so I can survive and barter it for food when the economy collapses.but there's no possible way I can trade 999 silver or 999 gold in a fucking shitty thirld world spic nation where the people that buy and sell stuff can't even understand why you want a silver bar.So, my only hope, is to buy silver jewerly, Is cheap enough I can afford it, and I'm sure I can barter and trade with it.So, I have only a few questions:Do cheap jewerly stores value (important question)?Can I use it to trade it for food when economy implodes?Is considered an investment?
