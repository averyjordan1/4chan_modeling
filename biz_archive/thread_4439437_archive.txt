He is smug because he is young and smarter than most people and has a little bit of resentment to go with it too (teacher telling him he to quit and work at McDonalds).
When BTC crashes to 300 dollars if it does, he will either have a stop-loss or he will hold, hes been holding since they were like 12 dollars or something like that.
this is stupid.
why does his age matter?he just some kid who got lucky
this guy ran a business that he sold for btc.
he didn't just buy btc and get rich like some useless neets out there.
