https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tokencard/I did some research on TokenCard.
Actually they are building a pretty good Product.
You can keep your Coins on a SmartContractWallet like MyEtherWallet and simple link TokenCard to it and give it a daily allowance.
Marketcap low compared to TenX, Metal and MCO and didnt pump yet.
Release Q4 2017 and with more and more releases early Q1 2018.
Forgot: They are basically also a WHITELABEL Card and App for other ERC20 projects like SingularDTV:https://medium.com/@SingularDTV/singulardtv-and-a-sngls-visa-debit-token-card-993c76e58af5
