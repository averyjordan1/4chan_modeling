I DIDNT BUY ENOUGH.do i buy now or is it dipping again?
GET READY FOR 1$ BITCHES
Don't buy, buy on dip, even if its more.
What's gonna happen when chinos wakey?
I mean it's only been an hour since they blew off the fork.
Most people haven't realized it yet.
>those 100k holders right now
Are chinks gonna buy Link though?
Do they even know about it, or is Walton and Neo going to moon more instead.
I was stupid and held off thinking the Binance bots would force this back down, only to finally fomo in at fucking 3850 and now it's going down.Jesus christ I lost so much of my stack due to this fucking fork, I want it back.

Don't worry, LINK will for sure dip again soon.
The alt pump is temporarily and only because of Bitcoin2x.
It's artificial.

So who was stupid enough to already drop his Link into this measly +40% pump or in the 3300 dip?51k since 1800-1900 sats here and feeling comfy
