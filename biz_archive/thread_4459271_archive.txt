Can someone redpill me on what a sell wall, buy wall and bid wall are?K thx
Sell wall is the price range of what ppl are willing to sell.
Buy wall is the same.
Sell wall is when a whale puts up a huge sell order effectively to scare people and push the price down, buy/bid wall is the same but opposite pushing the price up.
The walls are usually paper tigers since as soon as the price touches the wall, it is removed and put back up at a different price.
