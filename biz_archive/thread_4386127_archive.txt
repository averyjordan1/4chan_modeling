Hey guys remember the good old time where faucets paid you 1 BTC?
Well, that time is over, now we only have sites which are either clogged with ads or strangle your CPU with mining.
However a few are still legit, someone wants a list?
no
i'll take the bait give me those sweet viruses
Are there any faucets that just give you a bunch of different ERC20 tokens?
Here ya gohttps://www.reddit.com/r/ObtainFreeBitcoin/comments/79jgyg/best_faucets_list/
from someone with 0 btc in his wallet I can't donate to your lottery sorry.
Maybe a richfag on biz somewhere will help you get rich off his stupidity
Not that I know of, but earncrypto (ref 87814) allows you to get ETH which you can then trade on etherdelta for any token listed there.
It's all free?
theirs a few hub websites for faucets and games and lottos and gambling.
its fun.
Although so many ad's.
You can do surveys and shit as well for coinage.
I only really fuck with freebitcoin faucet, but not much.
Faucets suck desu, I just run ads on my laptop and desktop when I go to sleep and end them when I wake up and make bout 3 bucks of bitcoin a day off that.
Explain your ad method?
i use earn gg and run engagme.tv and the other ad option they have on my pc and laptop while I sleep.
Wake up to 3 bucks then withdraw.
