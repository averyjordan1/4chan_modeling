Where were you when Request Network (REQ) was below $1?
How do you make shit like this?
Is there an app?
I'm right here bitch.
ALL IN
When will it be above $1?
Why isn't it mooning like Power Ledger, when it's so good?
Why is it still below ico?
I kinda wanna buy REQ with 50% of my powr gains
Itâ€™s not below ICO anymore m8
it hasn't had the media attention.they aren't shilling it until they have a working product.
unlike powerledger.
Ok.
This is one of the worst pajeet coins.
The shillers don't even know anything about their 1 dollar coin.
I found it online, but there's pics of the app on their website.
I might make a template to use.
