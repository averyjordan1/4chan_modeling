Welcome aboard fellow ARKie
Mobile wallet release is going to be here by year-end, likely.They also released news that the blockchain is compatible with the Python coding language, and the Ark foundation (a nonprofit foundation dedicated to promoting Ark, similar to the Ethereum Foundation) is nearing completion.All in all, there's a lot of good happening, but I don't know what specifically is causing this pump.
Normally I ignore the Ark posts but these are legitimate bullish signals.
If we see a pennant start to form it's taking off big time.
Smart contracts on Ark.
It's a port of the EVM.
