Are people here unironically getting depressed and feeling suicidal because they think it's impossible to get rich off of crypto anymore because it seems like the days of 10-100x missions in a week are over?
Does anyone here actually see on a timescale longer than 1 month?
You think the applications of blockchain tech are just going to vanish and the entire crypto space is this pump and dump playground?
People got too used to 10x gains in a month when that was always fucking ridiculous.
It's clear that the era of riding these to riches is mostly over, but we're entering the era of finding crypto that will survive and make it to widespread adaptation.
These things take fucking time.
It pisses me off seeing impatient retards asking if a coin is going anywhere after a week, because it didn't make them rich overnight.
