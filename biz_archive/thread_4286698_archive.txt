2013-2016 - Missed the crypto train.2017 - Missing the crypto business stock train.Why are you stuck chasing minor gains on shitcoins and buying in at ATHs?
Now that crypto is worth something to people, why not just invest in companies mining it?Just bought into HIVE.
Why aren't you?
>Oh yeah, /biz/ wants lambos on Mars in a month.What stocks you into?
Made a nice 400% with HIVE blockchain in the past few weeks.They just released 28 million new shares to slow the price growth and it barely moved, like -15%, so a perfect chance to buy in before it goes back to $6.
Agreed.
Was waiting for the share dump to happen but its all just getting absorbed so far.
Riding this bitch.
What the fuck happened on Friday?
Ehvvf
Announced that the stocks in lockup were being released early to the general public.
Meaning staff could sell shares if they wanted to.
Typically when that happens you should wait and see.
Instead, public investors dumped and now it's just in correction.
