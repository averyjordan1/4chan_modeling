How are they still in Pre-ICO?What else is there?
Zen Protocol is in Pre-ICO still, looks good to me
Idk only worried about putting too much into an ICO.
10% of capital ok?
Might just do 1 eth maybe
Always hold a diversified portfolio to protect yourself from lossesIf 10% of your capital is 1ETH, you should probably focus on increasing your capital before taking high-risk high-return investments.
Even a 10x gain on your entire portfolio would only put you at $30k.
