It's going to be constant BTC rape over the next 22 hours while BCH miners are laughing.
Meanwhile BTC normies are holding their dicks wondering why their transactions aren't going through even though they paid the "premium $5 fee".The only reason anyone is mining BTC right now is they're desperate to keep the value up over the next few hours until they can dump all the remaining BTC that they're holding.
Exchanges holding lots of BTC are trying likewise to bribe the BTC miners to just keep going a bit longer.In five hours from now, you're going to have to pay 2000 satoshi/byte to get anything moving, just watch.
But it's going too be too late, BTC will be down at 5k and falling.
HHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA YES and this is only the beginning... you have not seen anything yet.
