Unironically: delet dis.
Can someone give me a rundown of this vs LINK?Pls don't tell me it's LINK's chad big brother.
Link to ico page pls going all in
wait....isnt this what LINK is doing.....was I fucking scammed by /biz/ again.....
Link connects 3 blockchains atm and data apis to smart contracts in a decentralised manor.This wants to connect all blockchains.All link has to do is add more blockchains if they are needed.
we don't talk about this here pls delet
Sounds like direct competition.
Does Wanchain also connect data apis?
Link sounds like a less cumbersome way to go about it desu
Wanchain doesn't connect to off-chain enterprise.
Blockchain only.
what date do I need to have my wancoins in the original wallet so they can be exchchanged?
I feel like my whole fucking world just got turned upside down.
I didnt even know this shit existed when I bought LINK.
Im fucking selling this scam coin now.
Fuck ever listening to biz again
it's already too late they're burnt forever
Oh, phew.
LINK still reigns supreme then, just making sure I didn't just have my lambo ticket changed into a daily bus pass.
Wankchain
LOLMorons, it’s nothing like Link.
It’s just an Asian version of ARK.
This
looks like they haven't released the official date yet.
I realized after I was initially terrified, now I don't give a fuck about this POS
Look harder, this is one coin i found.
There is another hidden gem elsewhere which has LINKs functions in addition to others.
I will let it get listed first and accumulate before shilling on here
