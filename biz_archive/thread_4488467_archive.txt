Look at the charts on this one.
There is no better risk/reward than this coin than now.
It's on Bittrex.
Chilling right on its 60 day support.
If you are slow and can't interpret what the chart says, basically the most this thing can lose is 5% (which it won't, because the RSI just crossed and it's starting to turn around), but when it goes up, you can see that it goes wayyyy up.
Basically you're risking losing max 5% for the chance to 3-10x.
It was barely hit by the drama yesterday.
Better hope you're logged into bittrex with funds to spare before the masses take notice and jump in this.
This is your chance anon.
