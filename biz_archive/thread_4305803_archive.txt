if you're selling right now or any time soon, you're a retard.if you already sold you're a retard.THOSE WHO HAVE NO FEAR WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST BAGS
I understand you're trying to hype this coin up and shill your shit...but you're using the "bags" term wrong.When an investment has dropped so low it becomes metaphorically "heavy" in your portfolio.
While being heavy to hold presumably due to a lack of buyers, they are referenced to as "bags".You want people to buy BCC, yet claim they'll own the "BIGGEST BAGS" if they do.Maybe an all curry diet isn't the most nutritious for proper brain function.
POOOO

Maybe an all curry diet isn't the most nutritious for proper brain functionfuuackk

THOSE WHO HAVE NO FEAR WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST BAGSYes, unironically.
This is what happened to me with the previous BCH pump and I ended with $1000 "worth" of BCH which nobody bought up until yesterday./biz/ cannot into exchanges.
Yeah I'd love to get some BCC and shitcoins if my BTC transfer would ever fucking go through
