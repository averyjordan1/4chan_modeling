My startup is giving employees the option to be paid in BTC or ETH.
We just have to link our Coinbase addresses and weâ€™ll receive our bi-weekly compensation.
Thing is we can only change our payment options like once or twice a year or HR gets pissy.Should I do it?
Is BTC about to crash and de-value my paychecks?
Do it, be a pioneer of the future.
The more companies/employees that do this will de value fiat and Cryptocurrency will take its place.
don't do it, retarded as shit.just setup an automatic buy on coinbase for every 2 weeks for the amount you want.
otherwise good luck paying for groceries in cryptos.
