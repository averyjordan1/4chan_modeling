I'm holding some BTC but I decided to take about 0.08 BTC and do some trading on Binance with it.
I turned it into 0.1 BTC.
Back and forth with some BCH and NEO.
Is this the right way to get started?
I will put in another 0.1 BTC to trade with a slightly higher volumeOpinions from more experienced traders?
Bumping because I'm using the same strategy.
I always thought btc was a good hodl but now I'm not so sure.
What will you do when you end up with 0.05 BTC or less?You think your brain is better at this than thousands of other brains doing the same?
What would you suggest?
