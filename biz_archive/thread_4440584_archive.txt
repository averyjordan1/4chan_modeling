Unironically it's the perfect time to get in.Just took a look at their website, new website launching in 17 hours.It's actually a cool idea, they burn coins every week to increase the value and people that burn coins will be rewarded.I swear I'm not shilling, it's just a coincidence that they're lauching their new website tomorrow.Low market cap, it was a gamble, it looks like it was worth it.Of course DYOR if you want to buy it.
