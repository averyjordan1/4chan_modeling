https://etherdelta.com/#0x7b22938ca841aa392c93dbb7f4c42178e3d65e88-ETHThis is currently moving sideways on ED but hasn't been listed.Fund managed by reputable company.
Automatically invests in only the highest quality research backed ICOs at discount whale prices and pays you quarterly ETH dividends in whatever wallet you hold the token in.It's been sideways at the same price range for a couple days now, I expect a breakout at formal listing.
