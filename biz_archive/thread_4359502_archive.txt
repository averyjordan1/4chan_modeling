Free TRX?
Logged into Binance just now to discover I have 500 Tron tokens.
Was this supposed to happen?
What's the deal with this token?
Not much info I am seeing on the net.
Looks like it may be Binance's token?
Google "Justin Sun Forbes".
I think you'll be impressed at the potential this coin has.Btw these drops were announced.
They did it on Liqui as well ~3weeks ago.

Justin Sun ForbesThanks.

I posted the exact same text in another thread asking about TRX.
I just CTRL-C'd it.
It is cool.
The kid is a protege of Jack Ma, could very well be the next Vitalik.
I'm holding 100k... no meme pun intended.
ever since this morning it has enjoyed a 15.44% rise ....
If I am not mistaken ali-baba founder is behind this
If I am not mistaken ali-baba founder is behind thisNo, but he is an "apprentice" of sorts of the founder of Alibaba.
And he's already got a platform with 10 million users to market to.
It has made quite a gain today ....
Perhaps Binance dropped 500 per active account, and trade volume is influencing a temporary rise?
I have no trx :(
So as far as I can tell it's actually worth like a euro?Thanks Internet!
time to buy more
