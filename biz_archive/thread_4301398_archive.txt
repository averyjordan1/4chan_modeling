When did we beat Korea at anything?
They send their shitcoins over by the millions, and what do we do?When was the last time you saw a Korean buy Bitcoin core?Itdoesn't exist, folks.
They beat us all the time.When do we beat China at the mining rate?
They're laughing at us, at our stupidity.
And now they are beating us economically.
They are not our friend, believe me.
But they're killing us economically.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else's shitcoins.
(APPLAUSE)Thank you.
It's true, and these are the best and the finest.When Asia sends its transactions, they're not sending their best.
They're not sending Bitcoin.
They're not sending you.
They're sending shitcoins that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us.They're bringing pumps.
They're bringing dumps.
They're pajeets.And some, I assume, are good people.
If Bitcoin cash overtakes core I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make bitcoin great again.
