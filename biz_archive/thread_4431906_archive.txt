>accumulation almost done, ready for take-off
I havent researched Coss yet, can I get a quick rundown?
(srs)
It's the token for a company with an exchange and point of sale system.l, both of which charge fees.
Token holders get 50% of all fees collected from any services in perpetuity, unlike Kucoin.
They are also branching out into remittances and prepaid debit cards next year.
Price is at all all time low after the hype after the ICO died out.
