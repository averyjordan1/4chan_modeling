The shills are starting to get to me.
Should I just sell this and buy Golem or some shit?
golem?
nigga you trippin'.
stay in the LINK family.
GET BACK IN LINE MARINE
Did you say golem?
The fuck
FEED THE BEAST
I thought LINK'ers were a bunch of bag holders?
are they tryna get out or something?
so much shill.
First of all you're all done.
The link family don't got that kinda muscle anymore.
Your best bet?
Index funds that track the s&p
I can't help but feel bullish on LINK.
Every small price drop it takes a hammering with the FUDsters here, toilet memes come out etc.
But I can already in my minds eye read the numerous nolinker pink wojak/"I fudded but I actually held link roflmao"/chainlink lamborghini pic threads we will witness over the coming years.
Yeh buy GNT or Exp, its looking ripe
People kept saying that they wouldn't believe link would moon because so many /biz/ will get rich.I guess there won't be so many of us in lambos after all
It is up to you.
Could either be the best choice you ever made or the worst.
Though if you are looking to put your mind at ease diversifying helps.
Publica, because it's the next Comfydo.
Diversifying will just cost you more lambos.
ALL IN BB ALL THE TIME
