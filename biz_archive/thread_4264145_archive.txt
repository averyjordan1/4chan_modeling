Up 30% and still not even touching it's amount of possible growth.
Who else got in in time for free easy gains?
sshh don't tell biz
Been holding from the first time I got in at 350 Sats, I'm probably gonna sell on this moon, though.
I'm just tryin to help people and show them there is another path besides buy high and sell low.
You might end up with a $.04 exit in a little bit if you have no interest in patience for the rest of the year.
Sold at 0.037$, don't know if I should buy back in rn
i'd say you have the rest of this month to hope for a better price point to jump in at, but who knows what could happen.
Yeah I couldn't resist, I bought in at 0.032 and held for like 2 weeks while it was down to 0.024, pretty scary with BTC not stopping and so, so I was glad to jump out with a profit, but I'm sure I could have traded this more clever
Jump in with whatever u feel safe and sit on it for a few months and u'll be golden.>consider maxing out credit cards and leveraging if you can maintain til june
