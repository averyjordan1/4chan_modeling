Who else here /smartmoney/ and shorting ETH and ETH futures vs BTC?BTC is deflationary, it will always go up while ETH has literally infinity coins.
You don't have to be an Einstein to figure this one out.Once the Vitalik kiddy fiddling stories emerge you'll see.You can short it on Poloniex and BitMEX: https://www.bitmex.com/register/YgC8kJ
If that's the only reason you're shorting ETH then you are a total retardWhat's annoying is if ETH does go down you'll think it's because you've made an astute observation that everyone else has missed out onBut if ETH continues to rise and BTC falls I hope you take this as a lesson and stop thinking you're quicker than the market.
Do PROPER research, invest in fundamentals, be patient, hold, and STOP TRYING TO FUCKING DAYTRADE AND TIME THE MARKET
Vitalik is a genius and incredibly useful to the Ethereum project but we are past the point where his death or exposure as a pedophile would kill the project.
Ethereum is the future, whether Vitalik is part of it and whether you like it or not
