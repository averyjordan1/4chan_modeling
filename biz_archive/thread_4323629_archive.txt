Not sure what’s up with all these fucking lemmings shilling their stupid Monero, but it’s getting really annoying.
Whoop de fucking doo, it’s slightly more anonymous than Bitcoin.
Nobody fucking cares.
Other coins do privacy better, Monero is an all around steaming pile of shit and anybody that buys it is a piece of human shit.
Good day
because of the animosity of the transactions
FUCK OFF VERGEN
