ANNOUNCEMENT: After consulting with our community we have decided to keep our portion of CFD tokens locked indefinitely.
This means that the 4.5 million CFD we currently hold will never enter circulation.
We have chosen to do this as we have no intention to sell, and we are still able to receive our portion of the revenue whilst they are locked.
