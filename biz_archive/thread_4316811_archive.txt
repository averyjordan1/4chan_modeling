$RKC is about to explode.
Crackdown in region, billionaires and millionaires need to move assets.BTC isn't safe right now.
What other option but regional based coin that gives back dividends starting 2018?I have on good authority that Eastern whales have picked this up and want in before oil sheikhs buy.Looking for 100k sats minimum but don't be surprised if it hits 300k sats next week.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/saudi-billionaires-are-said-to-move-funds-to-escape-asset-freeze?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social
It already exploded.
Bought at 5k sat, sold 3/4 at 40k and 1/4 at 50k.
This is actually the first time I said fuck it, 700% profit is good and took it.
No hodl meme, no regrets, feels good.And yes, it still has a lot of room to to up.
But not necessarily now, they will pay token holders around 2018 Q1.
Trying to help anon
Too much mental gymnastics with this.
I like DBIX coin because Dubai is crazy enough to adopt Crypto to solve a problem.
The Saudi Royals have been able to filter money through Gold for thousands of years.
The ones who are not exactly loyal to their faith would stuff it in any Crypto.
hey, leave our crown prince alone, you dumbass
