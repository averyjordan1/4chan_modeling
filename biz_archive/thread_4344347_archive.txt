post offers and we might talk, im desperate but i rather die than being scammed 2 times in a day
They need 5 more blocks.But it's not profitable enough to mine them, so my guess is that: miners are waiting for that cuck, that always mine BCH, to mine them.
Only then will they switch and only if it's profitable enough.
At current prices, that won't be too many.This is going to take hours.https://www.blocktrail.com/BCC

There is literally no need for bitcoin to excist anymore.
Old shit is old shit.
