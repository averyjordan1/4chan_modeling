>Massive swings in BTC and altcoin valuations>My portfolio is barely changed Who else is somehow just getting through these crazy times with no massive gains or losses?
Like, my BTC, Eth and Monero are great, my altcoins got banged up a bit, and it’s all a wash. Been in crypto for all of 3 months, portfolio up 12% right now.
Am I an overdiversified idiot?
Or is it good to not get JUST’d and keep your holdings intact, and wait patiently for the crypto bull market to continue in earnest?
It's always better to make small gains than to get JUST'd like the deluded linkies, don't worry about it.
Yeah that’s what I figured
Your portfolio is too diversified
