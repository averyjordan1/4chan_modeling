Trying to get away with not paying your rent sounds like something a nigger would do.All you are going to do with the money anyways is to gamble with it and lose it because you have no patience.
Yeah but I've learnt my lesson now.
Shouldn't have got greedy and paniced.BCH is going to moon this week if rumours are true
absolutely not.
you overleveraged and now you paid the price.
Take this as a learning experience, and trade lower leverage.
Take this time to research some trades and see if you'd even be a profitable trader in the long run.
So you think you learned your lesson, but you're ready to skip your rent payment so you can invest in BCH on the basis of the current batch of rumours.
I bet you're planning on trading on margin again too.
