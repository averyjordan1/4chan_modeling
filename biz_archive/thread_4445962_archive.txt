I keep reading about fraud cases in my city and surrounding area and people are making millions and when they once in a blue moon get caught they get like a year in prison.isn't that better than wagecucking?
Bump
If it's only a year at most as punishment, then yes.
Wagecucking is wasting your life away to make someone else very wealthy.
Unless the job you're doing has some deep meaning to you, you're wasting time that could be put to much better use.It's best to get creative and do legal shit, however.
Start a business or something.
