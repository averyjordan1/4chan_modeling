What coins should I buy in this dip, /biz/?
Accumulate the safe ones once the dip starts flattening out.
ETP for easy 40x gains
I'm Currently all in ETH, Should I get wilder?
Monero
BCH is practically printing satoshis now OK. Ez at least short term gains
go for linkull be rich
Missed the moon, I'm afraid.
BCH
BTC, ETH maybe XMR or some other biggie sounds good.
I hold dips but if I was actively buying I'd wait and buy 75/25 or 50/50 BTC/ETH once things chill out.
Market is severely overheated since the fork hype.If you want to gamble short term idk, I don't do that.
VTC is about to dip under $4, still a great buy.
I think this is a $20 coin EOY 2018, so longer term hold.If you want to day trade, WTC is the safest bet.
It is constantly finding support at about $5 and currently priced at $5.50~, and it will easily bounce back above $7 next week.
Currently holding ETH, Waiting for BTC to dip more before I go in again.
Been looking at XMR, BCH and BAT for Alts.
LTC is showing signs of stabilizing.
Buy in now?
I'd scap BAT desu.
The concept requires really wide adoption which is far off for crypto-based things.
BCH might be good short term but I anticipate the novelty wearing off.
As time moves on from the fork it will be seen more and more as just another alt.IMO.
DYOR.
Lol.
I'm what the kids call a "nucoiner" so that's what I'm doing, just trying to get some tips from you auts.
How far will eth drop do you think
FUN
