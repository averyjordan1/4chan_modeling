Any advice for someone who’s just getting into crypto currency/trading?
>Currently have 0.07 BTC and 3 ETH
Ichimoku Clouds.
It looks kinda complicated but it's not.
Just learn it to save yourself from serious pink wojacks.
you wont want to do anything else except watch numbers blink all day.
it sounds silly but if youre in school and you start making winning trades youre not going to care about your classes at all, and you might drop out.
Just do the opposite what /biz tells you to do and you'll make it
Honestly my plan going into it was just hold until the number get stupid high and risk losing everything at the same time.
Don't buy shitcoins.BTC, BCC, ETH and XMR is where its at.
Buy and hold for a year, then cash out and buy a car/house.
You're too late to the party OP.
All in on BTC.Tank me in 3 months
But everybody who bought NEO a month ago is rich
you might own got crypto, but i could easily beat the shit out of you, kid
Ok take that BTC and buy more ETH.. ETH will hit $400 by Christmas
ETH is going to be $250 by Christmas, not $400.
how do i get Ichimoku Clouds on bittrex
Start with good, low market cap projects and hope to catch a few moonings.
You’ll only get slow, steady gains with that number of BTC and ETH (aka never make it)
What are some examples of low market cap currency’s currently?
I am pedocoin ETH can confirm $250 by Christmas
