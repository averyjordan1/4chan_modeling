>Confido works by using smart contracts with a unique shipment tracking feature.>When a new transaction is made by a user, Confido will generate a smart contract using a secure smart contract template and the data entered by the user.>That smart contract will act as the escrow between buyer and seller.
Once the funds have been received by the smart contract the seller is prompted to submit a shipment tracking code to the smart contract (which is all done inside the app).
>Our smart contract will continuously track the delivery status of the package and will release the funds 24 hours after the package has been delivered.
In case of a wrong or faulty product the buyer can put the transaction on hold.this idea has a 10 million dollar market cap right now
BUY BUY BUY!!!!!
Take my money!!!
Shills confido.>Mainly shills link within it.
Is this like BitBay?
It's better
bought at .0024 ether right before it dipped and held.
Only 402 confidos but its pretty comfy right now.
I see a possible 4-5x still here.
why?
can you list a few reasons?
Basically this relies on a buyer not being an asshole, and a seller not being an asshole.
And thus, a reputation system needs to be in place, and a mediation system and....oh, Confido won't work because it can only work in a perfect world.
Unless both parties want to lose a deposit on top of losing the initial trade...I doubt we'll see the same amount of bad trades like we do on ebay.
What percentage of the sale does the deposit represent?
I think it could be set by the seller.
No it doesn't, it has a a mediation system in place already.That's like saying cars will only work in a perfect world because a handful of people will run people over for no benefit.
Will be listed in Binance on Tuesday
its 10 million dollars
