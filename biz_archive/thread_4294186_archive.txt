So today kinda sucked.
What price should I buy BTC at to recoup my losses?
Wait til tomorrow, Monday, etc.?
BTC is already recovering , look at the chart of last 6 hours.
Buy now
Recovering, only low dips
I'd say BTC is on the recovery like those other two with the uptrend, but really who knows.
Too early in the potential uptrend to make a confident call
>bitcoin will recover, it's an immutable law of the universe
Look at 1 day chart.
This is not THE dip.
