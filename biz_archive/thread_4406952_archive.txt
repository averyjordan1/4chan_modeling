Daily reminder you wannabee wall street traders would have done better if you just held bitcoin
Don't fucking remind me....
Yeah I'd have 2 bitcoins.
Instead I have 0.52 after 5 months!
>You would have made more just holding BTCNot everyone here buys high and sells low.
I've quintupled my BTC this year trading alts, combined with BTC's own growth its been a good year indeed.
Well woopty fuckin doo, to you
could have made it already with my 25btc - gamblit it away for link and req ;-)at least my bot is trading some of my losses back for me x) made a whole bunch on the bitcoin cash volatility.

I'm addicted to gambling and haven't lost yet, the post.
Hardly, I've made conservative moves, never putting more than 10% of my portfolio into any one alt.
Also am 80% BTC.
