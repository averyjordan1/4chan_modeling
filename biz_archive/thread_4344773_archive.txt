Too heavy bag?
Could any of you aussies tell me more about the Sunshine Coast/Brisbane area?
My girlfriend lives there and I'm flying out to meet her in a few months (long story).
fantastic area, I used to live in the sunshine coast with my ex, the cities are kinda separated (about 20m drive from any of them to any other), anything on the beach is fantastic, lots of asians and kiwi's, I hope you drink because that's all we do desu, But shit closes super early there, like most supermarkets are closed at 7pm and very few 24/hr fast food, even most mcdonalds close at 9:30.Just kind of immerse yourself and have a great time, was there anything in particular you were curious about?
I live in brisbane, its fucking great.
Just came back from europe and it really makes you appreciate how well off we are here
