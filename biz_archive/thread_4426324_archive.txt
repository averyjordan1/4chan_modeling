i have 2btcis it even worth gathering bitcoin anymore?
Gambling with shitcoins for that 10x is way more fun imo
you should use one of your BTCs to stock up on a bunch of cheap alts.
i got burned like 5 times on a small scale.
I'm not a trader.I'm just kinda sitting on the fence if its even worth buying more btc.
I'm at 4 BTC for the past 6 months, this non-stop Bitcoin rally really fucked me up the ass.You can't hold altcoins anymore like you could before.
If you don't take profits every time something moons, you'll just lose them.
i was hoping bitcoin would start having a stable price again, but i guess not.
I dont see the point of trading now.
a volatile market is better for trading you dense idiot
Alts exist to get more BTC.I don't have the balls to risk my stack anymore.
volatile bitcoin is bad for all the volatile alts.
What do you man if it's even worth buying?It moons every week kek.
coin is almost 8000 dollars, how much money is there wanting to still invest?
thats another thing i wanted to ask, would the government allow for bitcoin millions and billionaires who some are anarchists
1 coin is almost 8000 dollars, how much money is there wanting to still invest?200 billion dollar market - a drop in the financial ocean.So it has room to grow.
