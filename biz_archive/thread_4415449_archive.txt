Kek.. still holds VTC when NEO officially announced insane news in 3 days ;) lmfao
VTC Is the best, still me your cheap coins!
44154981/3 of my portfolio is in Vert and I feel I am missing moon missions.
I thought this would be at least $6 by now
Quit being so fucking autistic, this coin is up a huge percent.
It's going to $10 and then $20.
Looking for moon missions everyday is dumb as shit and a good way to lose all your money.
Please sell all your coins and quit crypto.
You aren't cut out for this if you can't handle a few days without exponential growth.
Fucking weak ass hands.
Everything has been dipping hard the past few days.
Just ride out the storm and HODL on.
Dont worry Anon
