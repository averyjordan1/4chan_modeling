say a family member is going to give me a used car for freethe blue book value of the car is $15,000could I ask the bank for a car loan for $10,000 and pay the loan off with money the bank gave me + interest and taxeswould that help build your credit?
is it even possible or would the bank find out I didn't pay anything for the car
a car loan will go to the dealership you're buying it from, not you.a personal loan with different stipulations will go to your bank acc and you can spend it how you see fit, but they aren't going to give you a 10k personal loan without amazing credit and collateral/income, get a secured credit card and use 30% each month and pay it off each month, building it takes time
ok thanks
