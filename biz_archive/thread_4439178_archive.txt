What do you do that you dont read the news for two days.
- 14 hours a day 7 days a week in Trades.
What do you make in the Trades?
K a year, with killer bennies like health vision, dental, and ten buck an hour over and obove my 180/k per year in a retirement account.
Why on earth would you waste time trading crypto with basement dwelling shut ins?
It is relaxing.
$NEO looks like its gonna be bullish for the next 1-2 days simply because of the news going around $NEO (most stuffs out there are still rumours though).
But definitely some big news will hit the market for $NEO as being tweeted by one of their council members.Previously i recommended buy in at 480k sats and then most of you sold at 600k sats for around 20% profit.
Right now i think its safe to enter at 530k sats and hold till we see a peak where we can sell it off again.
Copy that.
Roger.
relaxing
You don't trade crypto by the fire with a bottle of scotch?
broken chinky tech
What do you mean by "Trades"?
Crypto doesn't stress me, cuz I know I have a 3k direct deposit from my job every week.
therefore I do not make bad decisions, because I am not stressed over it.
Operating Engineer, Electrician, etc.
Union, of course.
Is it taking off now or can I still get back in below 540k?
