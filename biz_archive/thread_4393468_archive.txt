Is anyone going in this ICO?
ICO ending in 50 MINUTES!!
!ONLY 2M MCAP RIGHT NOW.
Team is experienced and has working product behind them as well.
This is going to be one of those Etherdelta moon missions...
Thanks anon.
Putting 1 ETH in it just for the punt, I reckon it will end up like Genesis vision 4x.

>Once the last PRIX is purchased and the token sale has ended, we will see exactly how many PRIX have been sold.
This amount will represent 83% of the total supply of PRIX tokens.
17% of PRIX will be added to this amount, and the rest will be burned.
Currently 1,031,412 PRIX sold + 17% = 1,206,752 total tokens.
This is interesting, and an unusually appealing product.
The promise to burn the unused tokens is really drawing me in.
Fuck.
So conflicted though.
Got burned by some ICOs.
Think I'll sit this one out, but have a feeling I'll be kicking myself.
ICO ending in 30 minutes now... your last chance
Only concern is that some people got a 40% bonus>Bonus First 48 hours : 40% (1 PRIX = 1.4 PRIX)>Bonus Week 1 : 30% (1 PRIX = 1.3 PRIX)>Bonus Week 2 : 20% (1 PRIX = 1.2 PRIX)>Bonus Week 3 : 10% (1 PRIX = 1.1 PRIX)>Bonus Week 4 : 5% (1 PRIX = 1.05 PRIX)
no issues with that, valuation is low enough
Same here but itâ€™s more secure to wait ED
Even though pre-salers got 60%?
the 60% and 40% are gonna dump

Did any of the presalers dump in recent ICOs?
Only flippers dump.
People who brought in this early in this kind of projects are long term holder/expert flippers.
quick guys only 16 mins left what do i do?
Can't wait to dump on all you biz noobs!!!!
easy money
seems promising.
Team has tons of former VPN and cybersecurity experience.
Also much bigger team and has a better business model than Mysterium.
Oh my god I didn't notice they are already operating 4 VPN companies already...
Have 232 PRIX
Gotta scoop up some of these on etherdelta before it moons
If you're not getting onto this already, then you should leave crypto trading
Told you I was gonna dump.
