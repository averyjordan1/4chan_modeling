Litecoin is going to $75 tomorrow .
The btc bilderberg group met tonight in NY , they don't like ETH , now are going to by Litecoin as their digital silver .
They know they can pump the shit out of this and its the obvious choice .
Their target is $150 by December .
how much of a pleb do you have to be to lose like this
I don't know if I believe about the meeting but I could see Litecoin hitting 75 tomorrow .
It's been undervalued for way too long , and is the best hedge besides bitcoin cash , which is expensive
Stellars and eth are a far better hedge.
They are actually getting used and will increase exponentially in use.
