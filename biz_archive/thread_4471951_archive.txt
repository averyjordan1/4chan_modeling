POWR just dumped as soon as a bought in!
Yes anon I have that power :D. Comfy as fuck knowing I lose money EVERY TIME.
Bought 0 value token which only got pumped because of palm beach research hype, retard you deserve to loose everything.
buing that high i..i can't my sides are dying
WE DEM BAG BOIS HOL' UP
POWR just went back up, dude you are not going to dump POWR on a 14k volume mate.
Its not a PBC pump n dump coin
It just tanked because every single fucktard pajeet out there tries to capitalize on the PBC pick which is supposed to be POT.It'll come back up soon enough.
There's a real product behind, a decent team as well.
Just wait a few days.
Thanks for posting this, I just went and checked binance and my order filled:)
