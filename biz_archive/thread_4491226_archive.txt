So I'm considering flipping my BTC stack for Monero.How can this be done anonymously?
Obviously Monero is an anonymous coin.
But if my purchase can be traced on an exchange, what's the point?
Is it possible to buy it anonymously without meeting some randomer in a dark alleyway to do a trade in person?
Get Monero at different addresses.
Send them to one Monero address, then send that to another Monero address.Should be good then.
Go to r/Monero
No - I mean actually buying them.
Authorities/hackers etc can see that I made the purchase at an exchange and therefore deduce my holdings.
How can I avoid this?
Wtf just go to shapeshift and exchange your BTC to a throwaway monero address.
Then transfer from throwaway monero address to your real monero address
Well the issue is that thereâ€™s still a paper trail from the initial purchase of Monero.
If you have Monero and you pass it to another account, THAT is private but purchasing Monero with BTC still leaves that initial purchase exposed.
Lbc irl btc.
Don't be a retard n try to buy xmr irl from someone, will raise a flag.
Then you already stated the solution to what you are asking.
Dark alleys are in your future.
Use LBC or LMdotCO and meet up at a coffee shop like a normal neckbeard.
If you are talking about trying to anonymize a previous purchase of BTC that you left a paper trail on, its too late.
You can ask the exhange to delete your records, but they wont.
This is what Monero fags look like.
There's LocalMonero and Liberalcoins, which are like LocalBitcoin.
I've never used them though.
