Should i keep ETP after china unbaning ico and neo becoming china ethereum ?
Of course, this is good for all china coins.
Mainstream adoption means Metaverse will have a better chance at being a part of it.
It's possible this shit about NEO is true, but you're fucking retarded to believe it and sell ETP.
based on it.
Also ETP isn't exactly competition for NEO.
ETP is focusing on different and specific use cases.
Do you know what they are?

It's a scam.
