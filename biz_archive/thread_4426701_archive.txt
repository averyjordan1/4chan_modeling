So let me get this right.
I still own about 5000 tokens from ICO.
That is 1/3000th of the total supply (and 1/2000th of circulating).Confido pays out fees generated through use of the platform to its token holders.
That means that even if Confido only becomes a moderately successful business generating €10mln a year in fees, I would earn (10000000/1500000*5000=) €3333 a year.
Is that right?
All cryptobubble bullshit aside, this seems like it'd be worth holding on to for a few years.
