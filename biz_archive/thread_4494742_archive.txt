Why's this shitcoin mooning?
Holy fuck 12% stop the presses
about 40% over the last week though
4494792also it continues to moon
There's no reason for it to be mooning, the only thing that could be remotely related is the fact that Loopring's beta over the weekend includes Funfair: https://github.com/Loopring/protocol/blob/erc20_token_lists/doc/tokens.mdBut that shouldn't really affect the price so it's probably just pick of the week or something.
weirdI just read something about a whale buying 250 million tokens OTC as well, I guess that's probably why.
Just speculating
