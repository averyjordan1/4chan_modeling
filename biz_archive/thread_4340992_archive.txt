No I mean I am the one that's selling chink stuff.
cockgoblincracksmokerlittleboysclubyou gotta niche it bro, pick an audience not a name
BackroomcastingcouchIt only sells black leather sofas
Whatever you do don't get memed by people telling you to get a .com address.
Your only traffic and sales will be coming from influencers and ads.
Depending on your niche chose something that immediately gives a potential customer an idea of your store while at the same time short and simple.
And don't forget to use oberlo and ask your alibaba vendors to remove all branding and or replace it with your branding.
oberloThis is the dropshipping shit right?
I can get products lower than oberlo but this is good if you want to list more items in your store .
