Why is your Blockfolio so good looking??

i hold 54K.
hang tight....
Mostly trying to invest in projects with good return.
I hope you're right, but everyone keeps calling it the next NEO, haven't there already been like 3 "next neos" in the past couple months, all of which got decent gains but then were instantly forgotten?
I meant the UI
"good looking" you mean the dark interface?
just download the new blockfolio dumbass
Sweet.

This will probably be the NULS case too, I myself would not kept all that money after the pump.
