Several million might help
If you spend it on material possessions, noIf you spend it on experiences with people you care about, it can help a lot
It'll make you not-sad and not-nervous about making rent and stuff.
You'll be a lot more insulated from bad things.
Losing your job won't be the end of the world and this can embolden you to press your luck with other things.This assumes you don't go nigger tier with your money and blow it all on bling, booze and bitches.Idk I'm at around $11MM and not that much has changed.
I did put in a deposit for a Tesla Roadster, but that's a few years away.
I identify in casual conversation as a Bitcoin investor.
Oh I'd appriciate that.I would invest a good portion, and take care of my younger sister.16UuA6CmXcToPSARfiH9JTZnV4doWyNQGZ
I'm like this anon.
Six figures, not much difference.
Really think seven figures would be the sweet spot.
But it's what you do with it that matters.
If you blow it living like a rockstar, you're gonna feel pretty bad.I'm gonna by a modest homestead--house, land, barn, truck.
Then just live a simple life growing food and not worrying about paying the bills.
I think that's a real formula for happiness.
You gotta set yourself up to have a low-stress easy-going life to be happy.I think you can achieve a happy life with money used the right way.
This.Also, travel and write a soup blog.
If you are a depressive that will not change but you will have more freedom to think and do things
triples have spoken.
