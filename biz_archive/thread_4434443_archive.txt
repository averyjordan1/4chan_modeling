Redpill me on fees for trading.I'm new and what are fees and how they fuck my 30 USD on litecoins in the ass.
because you bought on coinbase lol...
I bought them using efecty desu sempai.
Just use Kraken, Gdax or Bitstamp.For low amounts, Kraken doesn't require a pic of your id.
Sepa transfers are free and trading fees are around 0.25% at most.
GDAX doesn't charge fees as long as you do limit and 'post only'
