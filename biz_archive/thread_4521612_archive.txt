Evening,I have an active user base of approximately 3000, which has only been established in the past 2 months.At present i am looking to deploy a live, one hour daily, subscription based screenshare stream for the community.Our initial participation is estimated to be 40 people within one week of deployment.We will be charging $89 per month for this service.I am investigating as such video streaming platforms that have the explicit ability to have a subscription based service for only paid users.
In addition the following features are required:Security from free user exploitationWebsite IntegrationSimple MonetisationChatroomImportant to our decision is:Pricing ScalabilityUser friendly environmentMultiple Administrators or ModeratorsAbility to Record and save videos.In the future it is my intention to develop other subscription based packages that essentially provide informative news and graphs and also access to the live room.I have seen websites like zoom etc but they do not have an integrated paywall with the capacity to handle this.I was thinking of creating a wordpress site with an integrated paywall solution using an API, but i don't even know if this is possible, and if it is how i'd even go about it.
I am fairly computer literate but am just in way over my head with this shit.
My question is:has anyone had any experience with this and can offer some simple cost effective suggestions or could even point me in the right direction.super promising picture for attentionthanks
