i got the news on tgram instantly about 2x.my fucking brain froze.
saw btc pump at insane levels so i fomoed 10 btc in at 7725 just to watch it moon pass 7800 and dump to somewhere 7600 where i panic sold.lost like 2.8k$ lmao.
its nothing.
what hurts more is the unrealised alt pumps i missed man.
i waited 3 fucking weeks for this shit on the sidelines just to get rekt.dont even know what to do now.
prob go all in on icx or wan when out.
NEVER FOMO OR CHASE CANDLES.
if you arent sure what to do always wait
I always buy whatever is being pumped atm.N regrets so far, I sell as soon as it stops pumping.
