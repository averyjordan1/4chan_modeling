I bought 2,161 worth of TRIG at 7500.
I've got a sell order in at 8200.
I think selling at 9500 is possible, but I usually just stick with the sure-sell.
Just wanted to pass it along in case anyone wanted to jump in.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
damn, I just got telt
>tfw you bought at 8380 which is the top of its next surge.Ah god JUST get me off this slow ride.
Anytime it ever gets a nice upward trend some dip shit dumps it down 5% and a 2-4 btc wall appears causing it to go lower.
It hooked me up with 30% this time last week.
You may crack that 8380 in a few days, man.
