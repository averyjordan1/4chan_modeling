Anyone /resell/ here??
?Have made around 2.5k on ebay/amazon so far and am trying to build up my knowledge on the subject.
How long has it taken you to make that money?
Took me a little over a month, back in July-August.
I want to start getting into it again and I still have some inventory left over from when I started.
Yeah I do, get as much shit as you can listed the end of this month sales start shooting through the roof
Do you usually just hit thrift stores and stock up or do you find sales online and resell for more?
