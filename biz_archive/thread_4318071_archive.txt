Finding it really hard to keep investing in LINK when I keep getting JUST'ed like this bros:(
bump fuck your filters
Stay strong anon.
don't be a pussy, cunt
you're hardly getting JUST'ed anymore if you're buying at $0.17 and it dips to $0.16 or whateverEverything is down at the momentChainlink is partnered with SWIFTThere are tons of coins with higher marketcap that are completely uselessIt's only been around for 2 months or soIt will eventually get listed on BittrexJust relax bro and be patient.
We're gonna make it
You're a poopoopeepee if you bought above $0.16 desu
link has so much upside.
cant really drop any lower
 I did.
It was hard at the start, but EVERYTHING was moonin gand LINK kept going down.
I doubled my btc with BCH yday, and can now buy more than twice LINK what I had because it keeps going down.
Idk anymore.
Like sergey and steve really couldnt give two fucks.
They have their 16million each.
At least you can use USD to buy this stuffIm from nz and I have to use bitcoins to buy it
My buddy sold his shitty links and from 0.3 made 0.7 btc in one dayAnd I'm still with this piece of shit like last retardNo hope for me
not sure if this is a troll or not
once it gets on bittrex it will get noticed by PnD schemes.
then to the moon!
Mate what are you talking about.. there is no LINK/USD pair anywhere
4319118Oh sorry im retarded I just assumed
So would Link be the better option, or will Mobius be even more profitable to invest in now?
