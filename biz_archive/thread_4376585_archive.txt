Triple figures this week.
BCH money will pour into NEO.
r u sure
Saturday NEO will be $100
why
shit, I wish..
Because OP can then gloat next week saying "I TOLD YOU SO, NOBODY LISTENED!!!"
coz china will rule overthe western world, using cryptos.
you will buy their shitcoin for 1000s of times what it is worth.
I hope so anon but I highly doubt it.
$100 by December
That's 3x, decent.Or..>ETP Metaverse, aimed at businesses rather than developers>Chinese>Antshares/NEO co-founder>Wallet issues being resolved (like NEO was doing in the summer)>More exchange listings in progress plus other project pending announcementsx3 would make it $9 but this has room to grow to $50 looking at the current marketcap, do the maths anon
No i just wanted an excuse to post that image
Not before BCC mooned one more time.
But yeah i hope to double my neo exactly this way.
Might my dream of 1000neo come true
$x3 = 9$
NEO $100 approx..$30 x3 = $90DecentETP $3 approx.. to $9 = x3But ETP can go like $30 = x10 with current marketcap and being undervaluedClearer now for you
High possibility ETP overtakes NEO too definitely stacking metaverse as a hedge
etp can't even get their fkin wallet done correctly let alone allow icos on their platform lmao.
There is a reason why theres a big price different, its not undervalued
