Ignore it.
you're a fucking retard.
Why do you keep making these threads giving horrible advice and signals when you have no fucking clue how to read the charts?
Why do you keep posting these everyday even when you're the only idiot posting in them?
Then you samefag and argue with yourself.
Just stop.

The official trend trend for copper has yet to begun, the stop targetters are about finished

I think there will be a large spike down at tomorrows eia, at whatever swing down, Ill exit there
+1.28% on copper short.. still no real trend established
