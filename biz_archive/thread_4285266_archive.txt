I would love for someone to tech me about buying a good starter crypto.
Been learning about it but dont know where to start.
i heard SDR is being set as new world currency and will eat BTC and ETH so kinda reluctant.
just want to know how to get started.
any anons have any suggestions?
With this storm thats brewing gotta act fast.
Special drawing rights won't be the replacement of USD as the world's international trading currency.
Something less cumbersome and more available will.
im new to posting in here... just been lurking.
is it ok to post links?
