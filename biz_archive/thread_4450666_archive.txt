You guys do realize December is the make or break month for LINK>SWIFTâ€™s DLT PoC started in April 2017 and will conclude in November 2017, with the final results available in December.The only reason why LINK hasnt gone down to 1 sat is because the market knows there's a probability that SWIFT will partner with LINK.Strap in and wait for December.Either link goes straight to $5 or to 1 sat.
Its all or nothing.
deluded link
SWIFT and Smartcontract.com are already partnered.Smartcontract.com is developing a smart oracle for SWIFT.Dont confuse this with SWIFT using Chainlink.
