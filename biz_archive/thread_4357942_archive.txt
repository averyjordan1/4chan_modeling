Hey /biz/, /pol/ here, you all finally made the news!http://www.businessinsider.com/ico-cryptocurrency-pump-and-dump-telegram-2017-11>LONDON â€” Cryptocurrency exchanges are rife with "pump and dump" scams that would be illegal in most markets and leave unsuspecting investors at risk of large losses, a Business Insider investigation has found.>Crypto traders are using the secure messaging app Telegram to orchestrate the scams.
Their strategy is to suddenly inflate the price of a cryptocurrency by coordinating a few buyers to act at specific times.>Then, after the price rises, they attract other, unwitting investors to buy into the price momentum.
The "pumpers" quickly sell the coin to make a profit.
The coins often crash just minutes after the initial surge, leaving the second wave of investors with losses.
Jews mad that the goyim now play their game?
Kek.

Ooh no, those poor unwitting, unsuspecting investors.
