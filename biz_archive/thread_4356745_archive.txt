POWR is going to the moon.Event starts in 3 hours and it will keep on going.60% in the last day
Buy the rumour, sell the news
Between getting added on Bittrex and the AMA, it has a ton of momentum.
I think it can hit 6k sats over the next 24 hours.
No.
They are currently in a trial partnership with Australia's largest energy company.
This coin is no joke, it is the first real implementation of a crypto ledger into the public sector.It's going to be huge.
It almost doesn't matter what the news is.
It's garenteed to dip.
People are short term buying and selling this right now.
60% in one day isn't because millions of people decided to believe in the project all at once, and buy all at once.A lot if people are going to sell.
This is a long term hodl.
It's unlikely normies will buy it so why would it be huge?
lol they are already dumbing it on bittrex
Pretty foolish behavior.
First of all not everyone got in right before it increased by 60%, second of all this isn't a coin to try and day trade with.
It will go possibly 20-30x within months.
If you miss that ride because your tried to knick 5-10% gains here and there riding dips, you will regret it.
