LOL if you fags don't get in this POWR moon mission A$AP Rocky.
im already in but wtf happened, why is it suddenly pumping?
Broke 4K sats once again!
This, I'm not complaining, just confused.
Its DEVOURING sell orders
HERE WE GO BOIS
What's even going on?
I've got a sell order set at 93985 so I can maybe buy back in at a dip, should I raise it?
solar power is for commies fagot
Its going to 5k then rebounding back down.
I'll sell about half of my stack when it does
That's wind power you're thinking of you moron.
If I can profit off of commies I will.
It's been done before.
Has it hit the top yet?
Nothing happening
stfu it just rallied to 4k, its stayed there for a while now, doesn't this tell your thick brain something?
Its seems like a breakout to 5k sats seems likely.
Just need a couple of fomos or a whale to give the price a push.
you sound a little unsure about yourself there buddy, better sell while you can ;)
This is the 4th time it has hit over 4k now, I say seems likely because the last 3 times it hit it, it rebounded so maybe this 4th time its going to 5k.
anyways I'm not selling until 5k, I'm actually looking for it to come down once more to 3k so I can buy more before the run up to 5K, but unfortunatly I think not
