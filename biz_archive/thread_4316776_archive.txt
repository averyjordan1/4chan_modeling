He got dumped on.
lmao.
He just unlocked all of his coins (25K) in cold storage and transferred them into Bitfinex's walletIf no one stops him from market selling on Bitfinex, Bitcoin is pretty much doomedhttps://blockchain.info/address/16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVT
https://blockchain.info/address/16cou7Ht6WjTzuFyDBnht9hmvXytg6XdVTHoly shart, 50,000 more bitcoins sent
What does this mean, BCC pump??
You think 25k coins can doom bitcoin ?
Oh sweetie
They're putting everything into this.
Now I want to see them fail
K can easily wipe out the whole order book of Bitfinex in a second

it means he will buy 25k worth of BCH :) bye bitcoin
How about when mark karpeles gets his 200,000 bitcoins released to him.
BTC has a market cap of 200 billion.
