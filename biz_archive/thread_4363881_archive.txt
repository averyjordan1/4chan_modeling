is there any way to do this other than using the chroot to install a virtual windows OS on it?
i got it as a gift a year or so back and it is honestly just a useless piece of shiti have access to free internet and power that i can safely leave it at, so theres no problem there, itd just be pure profit
noit's pointless unless you get at least a decent cpu/gpuyou'd be making like 0,001 dollar a month or somethingyou can find more money walking down the street looking down the floor
meh, fair enoughim honestly just trying to repurpose this fucking thing, but there is literally nothing that i can think ofuse it as an office computer?
for what office..?sell it?
people wouldnt pay 20 bucks for a chromebookany suggestions would be appreciated
put cryptowatch.ch on full screen and look like a professional broker
www.bitcoinity.org is also good
Look for could only coins, anything cryptonight with smaller payouts is also viable, I mine Bytecoin with spare phones and Android tablets with minergate trash, but there's an actually good arm64 executable of a cryptonight miner if you wanna root your device and put in effort.If you've got an x86 (Intel) Chromebook, you can just compile a cpu miner.You'll need more than just the one device to make any real gains.
*CPU only
Youâ€™ll get more coins if you just sell the chrome book
pretty muchif you can sell it for 10,000 dogecoins you'd make more coins than mining with it
I also agree.
You are wasting your time trying to mine with that.
CPU may not even have the correct architecture to mine anyway.
4364156yeah, i figured as muchi already knew it was a futile attempt but i was hoping there might be that magic gold nugget waiting for meill try and see if someone will buy the piece of shit, but anybody with half a brain knows that chromebooks really are worthlessits sad too because they have so much potential to be useful, but their OS is extremely limiting
how much are you selling it for and what are the specs?
I might buy it, my mom needs a new computer but all she does is watch youtube, use facebook and play candy crush so a chromebook would be fine
