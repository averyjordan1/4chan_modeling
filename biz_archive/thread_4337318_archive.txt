Let’s discuss the long term effects of the forking fiasco for the past 6 months.
Now that the scam is over and thousands of NEETS have lost their pocket money to chink miners, What will this mean for crypto in the long term ?
BCH would be dead soon and it’s clear that segwit 2x was a farce by the same people who propped up BCH.
Will there be any retaliation against Jihan and Rodger ?
How are the normies going to deal with this ?
What about possible government regulation ?
Something has got to give ?
1.
90% of crypto is owned by a small minority.
The problem is that most people don't DYOR and can't seem to understand that the market can be adjusted by heavy movement.
No one had to buy BCH when the rumors came out.
BTC was still a product of Supply & Demand.
The mining situation sucks but when you purchase a BTC there's no guarantee of transaction time.
Trump would lose the election if he tried to bring down Crypto.
His supporters are middle class & lower middle class.
Many are in Crypto because they hate taxes & Wall Street campaigned against Trump so I don't see him giving a fuck.
(fwiw I hate Trump) 2.
Part of the problem will be resolved when new exchanges come out that allow other coins to be traded for Alts - 0x, whatever becomes of Loopring & DubaiCoin
Wall Street campaigned against Trump so I don't see him giving a fuck.That is incorrect.
Trump has a huge number of Wall Street people working with him, mostly ex-GS.
If they write a bill that bans crypto and put it in front of him, he will sign it.> Part of the problem will be resolved when new exchanges come out that allow other coins to be traded for AltsRight.
This is why I own a significant amount of COSS.
They will be launching their fiat gateway soon, and you will be able to go from fiat to any of their supported alts.
