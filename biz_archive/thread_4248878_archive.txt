Just accept it and get in good alts.
this.
BTC is forming a double top.
there is no umph left to this pump.
alts have been drained, no new money is coming in.
enough.
don't be deluded and buy some cheap alts while you can.
Is it because you can't afford a whole BTC to yourself?
Today only about 20 alts are in surplus to bitcoin.Check coinmarketcap and compare to Bitcoin.
If you dont hold the green coins u made the wrong choice.
It's because the Finex Tether gravy train is out of coal.
BTC is up $500 in 24h you blithering idiot of course that's the case.
BTC is forming a double top.You mean it's slowly rising back up after having a triple bottom.
Don't call a double top until it actually hits near 7600 and refuses to go beyond that
BTC up $500 in 24 hours>Thinks it won't break its previous ATH>Thinks alts will stop bleedingGet your wojaks ready
yeah but tone vay said its the top.
So were the Tether fudders right after all?
