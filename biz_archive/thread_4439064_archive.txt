I got a leak from a known source from my ass that Power Ledger will be pumping to 5k sats, some poop from my ass had some words carved into it and it said "BRAAPPP" I deciphered the meaning of it and it came out as "Power Ledger is a very good coin sirs, please buy, it go to 5k sats I pump no dump".
So take this information as you will because this Power Ledger coin is going to 5k sats, yes 5k satoshies.
Do you even maths from 4k to 5k?
Thats an 1K increase, 1000 units.
Quality thread = Empty thread as always, you fat filthy lurkers know what this means right?
you sure about that?
About to go under 4k sats
Its 90,000 sats...
