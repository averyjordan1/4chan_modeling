USD
I don't see SALT mooning until all this BTC shit blows over.
There is no way in hell I am locking up BTC in a big fat SALT loan to have that shit fall like a rock if BCH takes over and I get the call from SALT to make up the 50% or more collateral value lost.
lol, fools
Guessing anywhere between $20 and $50.By the end of next year, $200.
>when people buy LINK instead of saltthese guys are gonna be SALTy in December.
link tries to do everything, when only loans are truly necessary.
That aside, I can only see it doing about 40-55 USD within the next 12 months, and briefly at that.
It'll level out at about $18-22.
non retards are protecting themselves by holding both
link tries to do everythingIt only does one thing, act as a decentralized oracle.
Its just that the use case of an oracle with smart contracts is very large.
Even SALT needs LINK to be completely trustless.
Think about it, the smart contract for SALT loans needs to keep track of the price of BTC.
They are currently using a centralized oracle (most likely Oraclize).
If Oraclize.it gets compromised you guys are doomed.
Take note that SALT isnt the only platform using Oraclize currently, so the incentive to compromise it is huge.
Get why everyone is so bullish for LINK now?
