>He hasn't realized that Ethereum should be $1000 each by now.
Oh, the thought's crossed my mind.
rip 0.15 eth/btc
no but i know the dev is a pedo.
infinite supplyYeah noI'm surprised this is 300$ desu
>shouldbecause you say so, right?ethereum is going to be $300 forever.welcome to reality.
Only thing keeping the price down is projects selling ICO money
Unlimited supply keeps the price down.
When Casper comes out and staking becomes a reality, Eth will have to be limited in supply and the price will jump
I'm still waiting for a satoshi to be worth 1 bitcoin
there'll be less new eth mined than btc
faggots don't understand how ETH works so they just throw the unlimited supply argument.
so funny.ETH will have about 115 million coins by 2500.do you see how retarded you are when you> unlimited supply.
already priced in
Lambo land will come.
Just will take a few years of holding :)
I know you guys barely get out, but pedo shit doesn't go over well in the real world.
Ethereum will never will get mainstream adoption.Perhaps other (foreign) projects on the blockchain wont be affected.
I am exchanging my ETH for OMG and LTC.
