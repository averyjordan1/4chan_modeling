Get in boys LGD is at its lowest point in forever - guaranteed to pump over a dollar twice a week
One whale could surely pump this thing 10 cents!
I'm buying a few at a time.
whats the sell goal?
It usually pumps up over a dollar, then settles at around 1.10 to 1.50, then falls all the way back to the 70s.
so in there some time.
Just a great spot to get in on this dumpster fire for the inevitable dump.
Gotta get some whales in here to ignite the fire!
When my squa gonna pull up on this shit?
Def wanna get in before this shit hits 80 cents
Explain to me why I shouldnt put 500 into this right now?
unless you nee the money asap... otherwise this thing cant go much longer without a pup.
How much you buy?
MOON MISSION TIME BOYZ
just threw a K at it we need some big boy whales to set this into orbit!
