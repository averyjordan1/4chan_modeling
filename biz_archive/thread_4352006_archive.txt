Currently in a joke of a stocks/investment class.
Brainlet teacher doesn't know the difference between company shares and commodities.
He set the class up on Investopedia stock simulator.
Wondering if there's any way to cheese/cheat Investopedia.
Otherwise, just wondering if /biz/ wants to have fun with me on this.
maybe, I doubt anyone cares what you do with a simulator.
but what's the point of cheating with fake money?
Just use TA.With stocks it actually works
So I guess, their academy isn't worth it, right?Any chance to find a torrent or something?
Buy pharmaceutical stocks before a big event (clinical trials, FDA approval/disapproval); you either blow your account or beat everyone in your class with low effort.
