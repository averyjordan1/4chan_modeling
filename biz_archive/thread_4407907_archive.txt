Started trading this week.
Has been a lot more productive than shitposting on /pol/.Today I branched out from bittrex and followed a couple tips on some buys on EtherDelta.HOWEVER - and I know this is a complete newfag question - what is a good wallet to use in the beginning?
Is there a universal wallet?I know almost nothing about wallets.
Thus far, the few hundred I have I've just kept in the exchanges for the week, but apparently this is incredibly stupid.
Because I don't want to be incredibly stupid - what should I be doing with the coins I'm squirreling away?
I put a little into astro, among others - should that get moved to a wallet?
Which one / how / act like you're explaining this to someone who's never used a wallet before and has only been trading for a few days (because that's me) and give me some good /biz/ advice here.

Want to know as well.
I started looking into Electrum.
I I think I will store BTC there.
Small amounts probably make more sense keeping them in exchanges, right?
Hi /pol/tard.
Bitcoin wallet is blockchain.info, ether based coins can be stored on MyEtherWallet (MEW).
So you can put your shit Astro on that wallet.
Just make a wallet on mew and send your tokens there.
Alright, I'm in the same boat as you guys, and so far the best I online wallet seems to be myetherwallet.
I'm still figuring out how it works, making sure I don't send anything to a black hole.You just go there and generate a key, then save that somewhere and use it to login later to get an address to send your tokens to.
There are some FAQs there, but I can maybe answer a few questions.
Is there a universal wallet?Not yet.
Use electrum for btc.
MEW for eth.
Always back your shit up.
Then back up your back ups.
