mfw people keep getting burned by GOOD coins because they keep buying ath and will now hesistate to buy a shilled coin when it is low.
Ahhh thanks man now it'll allow me more time to pick up on these good coins before they start rising fast.
So much anger today.
Glad I pulled the trigger on NULS when it was only up 60% last night.
