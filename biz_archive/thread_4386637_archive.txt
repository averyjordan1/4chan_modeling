So how does /biz/ does their research interested on where and how you guys get your intel
Research?
/biz/ doesn't research
CPlots of itthen i buy eth
i FUD every coin on biz until someone gets triggere and responds with massive info dumps on why their coin is good.
from there i'll actually research on my own and decide to go in or not
We let our army of pajeets mine instagram babes and twitter news, then mostly ignore the news
This is actually a great idea.
