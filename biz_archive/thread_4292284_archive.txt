"?Pump.Real working product, devs are actually experienced and no fags yelling "LAMBO" or "MOON" into every chat they can find?More likely to be natural growth.

It's called asking yourself all of the time "Why is this coin pumping/dumping"If you cannot think of any logical reason for it to, then it's a PnD.
Now some groups are smart and will wait until promising news or a rumor comes out before starting the pump.
In this case, ALWAYS take profits after seeing two large green dildos.
There is 100% always a pullback from giant moon missions.
Also, coins with mil market cap cannot generally be pumped and dumped with good results.
If a coin in one of those is mooning, there's a higher chance it's for legitimate reasons like one of their products being released or a major announcement.
This is why trading shitcoins with low volume is dangerous.
is the shitcoin rising like mad without any news being released that warrants the rise?if yes, it's almost certainly a p+d

In real world stock market, real growth comes from profits.Almost all cryptos are scam pump bubble ponzis because they generate no profits.There are few like XRP, XLM and MOD used by real businesses, these are real growth.
There are some like Confido that priced itself reasonably at $450k.
There are some like Funfair that has working products (I think Funfair's market cap is unreasonably high).
There are few good coins like these, but almost all cryptos are scam pump bubble ponzis.
