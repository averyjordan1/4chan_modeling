I have a newbie quesiton, how do I transfer BTC from paper wallet to Bittrex or any other exchange?
I have created Coinbase account, deposited some money and bought BTC.
I've sent some BTC from Coinbase to a paper wallet that I've created on Bitaddress (including BIP38 enryption with passphrase).How do I sent these BTC from paper wallet to Bittrex wallet now?
I went to wallets on Bittrex, clicked + BTC and now you get this address and QR code.
What do I do with this?
Enjoy your fees
Yeah I'm first time doing this and learning, that's why I deposited 50€ to just learn the whole sending things around and later buying/selling on exchange platform.
Don't worry, it's 50$ to just fuck around and wrap my head around things.
I sent 5€ to paper wallet and got 7€ fee and understood quite quickly I'll have to look into how to minimize my fees, because this shit was hilarious and sad at the same time.
Download a bitcoin wallet, use private key to swipe wallet, send to bittrex btc address.
