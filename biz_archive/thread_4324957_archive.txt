My btc is about to arrive at bittrex when the miners switch back to btc in 20 minutes.Now, i want to buy monero, decred and IOTA.This is my plan: 1. buy monero and decred on bittrex2.
buy litecoin on bittrex3.
transfer litecoin to binance4.
sell litecoin for btc5.
buy IOTA with btcDid i miss anything?
now that BTC is going up?are you crazy?in 15 minutes the BCH difficulty will change, BTC will go back to be mined as normal.
Another attack on BTC is deflected, and it becomes stronger.Faith in BTC restored 100x, price to the moonand you want to leave?sure
