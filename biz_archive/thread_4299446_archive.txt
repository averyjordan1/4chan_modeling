The flippening is so fucking real
I've got $20 USD riding in this so it better be.
i put about 10000 USD from my savings straight into bch
I converted most of my BTC to BCH at 0.08.
These gains..
I will make it.
AHHHH
good idea if you did it 2 weeks ago youd be filthy rich.
it was like $200 a coin mid-october
Unfortunately my exchange can't get funded from my bank account yet ... so I'm SOL.

went from 4000$ to 9000$ in a few days, im so fuckign cozy right now
Yep, that's me allright :(
rightbut i expect this to go to at least 2k so at least i have some winnings, and im hopeful for a real actual flippening
Soon Bitcoin Gold will be more valuable than Bitcoin Classic
it's dropping :/
And in this minute, a great lot of BCH bagholders was created
