Bought £200 ($265) of BTC when it was £5700 a coin, got 0.035.I feel like Unless I sell a load of personal possessions I’m never going to make a BTC now, I’m too late to the game.What’s the best strategy here?
Buy an ETH coin and wait till it moons?
Could use some advice, feel pretty hopeless
everyone that bought BTC for the past 2 years has said what you said.
its never too late.
Yeah?
I suppose you could be right.
In the long-run perhaps 0.034 is *enough*How much do you have anon?
Buy AST and be rich at EOY.
check out ethbet too imo Op 
Just get what you can, bro.
We're all going to make it.
What are the odds that BTC keeps climbing?
Is 20k realistic lmao
i bought some eth and ltc last week and made 120 so far
If 0.034 will be enough I will be unimaginably rich :)
