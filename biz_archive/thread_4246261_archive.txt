Fuck now I finally can buy this in 30 min... cos fuck EDloaded up 30 eth ready to go bitcheswhos with me
I am but only with my hamble 0,5eth
I bought at 0.001 on ED, i'll keep riding that up thanks.
Bought in during the ICO, looking to expand my holdings so I'll buy more once it goes live on Kucoin.
Anyone who thinks this is going to moon once it hits kucoin is completely delusional.Not a single one of you give a shit about the product or service itself.
It's 100% about making gains.. And since it's already hit mooned, expect it to shit hard.
Remember, be fearful when everyone is being greedy.
Im not being greedy, im more of the type who buys a token based on the whitepaper and how good I think the business model is.
The gains you see in the short term will dwarf what I will make if I manage to pick just 1 of the next big players in the rapidly expanding world of crypto.To put things into perspective Amazon when it was new, was only at ~$ 1-2.
If I gave up and sold during the crash I would not have gotten the gains I have now.
ofc its not going to moon 10 min after listing that's just stupid thinking.
Mid to long term though - mln mc right now when shits like xvg are 10x bigger lol just be patient
