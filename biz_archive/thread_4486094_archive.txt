Alright alright fine!
First thing you gotta do is set up an account on Coinbase.
They are going to require some basic identification from you (ID, Address, etc) and then you'll.have to wait for at least 24 hours for them to verify everything.
Then, for a larger transaction you are going to sign up for Advanced Verification that will require your bank account number and at least 5-7 business days for the transaction to process.
At that point I can send you ALL of my BTC from an exchange BUT Bitcoin has been having some transaction issues lately which means it may take days to process what I send you.
The reason for that is due to a philosophical technical debate which actually led to two separate hardforks of the coin.
OH, a hardfork is.....
