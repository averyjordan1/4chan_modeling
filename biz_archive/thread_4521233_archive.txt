if you like money- buy the dip.
will moon moderately when korea/china start trading tommorow, then the mega moon mission the following day.
just my opinion though, but you can always rely on a pajeet
Not to be one of those bch fanboys, but I traded 11.1 btc for bch earlier today at 0.19 because of this and other theories.
It's certain it will go up, just dont know much it will, if teories are correct, I might just multiply my money, else i'll just double it, so... win/win 4 me fags
what theory give me something so i can invest more
thank you for buying my bags
