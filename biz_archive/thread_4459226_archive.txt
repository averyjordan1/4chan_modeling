Yes that's it goyim keep buying.
It'll keep going up.
Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary
you can't increase the supply of tether without an increase in tether market cap or the price will dumpHAHA, that's the point, they can.
that's the whole jig, every tether is exactly one ""backed"" dollar.
thing is they aren't backed, they're just made out of thin air.
Lmao that loser is still ass hurt about selling btc at 1k
TA is voodoo.
Those are completely pointless lines that prove nothing.
