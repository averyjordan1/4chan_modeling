Anybody who bothered to read the whitepaper when this pile of crap was first listed realized that the only reason it is on an exchange is to provide liquidity to the data scientists who are paid for their work in this token.There is no value to the token to anyone except the data scientists, and it was intended to be that way.
In fact when the idiots bought this thing when it first hit Bittrex and drove up the price, Numeraire made an announcement that they didn't expect the token to have the value that it was trading at and promptly lowered the reward to the data scientists by 90%.Your lesson is to read every whitepaper.
If it being pumped for whatever reason and you want to take part, have an exit plan.
