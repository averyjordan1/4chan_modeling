Okay, I know a lot of you have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to trading and just general questions for that matter.
I have complied a list of things that will definitely help you get started.
BTW take what anyone says for a gain of salt.
There are thousands of different ways to look at things and thousands of different opinions.
In the end, it is YOUR money so invest whatever money YOU feel comfortable with losing.

Honestly, the best thing to do is just research these links and spend about 2 hours a day just learning about coins.

Thanks anon I sincerely appreciate these posts.
It would be great if we had a wiki and this sort of stuff was in it.
Yeah I am trying to just compile a huge list of links and a ton of info.
But what I have to do is read through each article to make sure it isn't shilling, so it takes awhile.
