decentralized exchanges are a pump dump scamIts almost like you guys like the risk of having your account hacked, the exchange closing and taking all your coins, and having multiple retarded wallets for every single shit coin in your portfolio.
Decentralized exchanges are an absolute necessity in the future.
I've been holding this bad boy since S1.00.
Block Net is also a lower supply coin and so price can easily skyrocket with enough market cap.

So youre telling me lower supply coins dont have faster price action in relation to market cap compared to higher supply coins like Ripple?
I couldn't agree more!
Blocknet is the only group out there right now actually giving a shit about Satoshi's vision.
Almost everything else is turning into vaporware (if it isn't already), and everything is becoming alarmingly centralized.
