OP this thread caused today's fall in price
I used to have 6400.
Now I could afford about 2400 if I bought back in.
Also I would have been accumulating from the /biz/ delegate if I just hodl’d so I’d have 100 extra for free now.
RIP
great time to accumulate, then
There's no reason to ever hold ltc.
fugg I only have 150 Ark.

Anyone heard of e-Ark?
Someone was here yesterday air dropping it.
I posted my ETH address (token compatible) but nothing is there.
I got some from an earlier airdrop, but it took a few days.
I did receive 150k eark of the second airdrop, this anon was really nice, not sure how much it'll be worth though
OK, thanks.
I had posted my Coinbase wallet first, then realized it wasn't token compatible so I posted the 2nd as fast as I could.
Hope they weren't sent into oblivion.What the fuck is e-Ark though?
This one was only 10,000, but still.
I don't even get how people can have less than 500 of theseThis coin was on /biz/ since it was 25 cents and it was under a dollar for months.
How do people here even have less than 100
New money is always coming in, but most of them can only spend lunch money on crypto
3000+ here.
A friend tipped me off to this.
Funny thing is he dumped it all around $1 because he had no patience.
