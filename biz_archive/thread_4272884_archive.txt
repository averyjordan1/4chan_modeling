MOD NULS and REQ all around the 40 million marketcap range, I'd take profits if I was you.
This is the range ICO usually get blocked at, some ICOs go to 60 million though.
lol kek go fuck yourself anon and try buy my bags for maybe 10x :)
Nuls and Mod maybe, but REQ hasn't even started to move yet.
I hold them, I just took profits, also for NULS I sold all mine at $1, its clearly not going to 80 million marketcap
Nuls is going to $3 billion or more.
People still haven't realized that it's the InChain team, and that InChain will run on the Nuls platform.
I hate shilling, but I'm telling you guys, this is a moonshot.
