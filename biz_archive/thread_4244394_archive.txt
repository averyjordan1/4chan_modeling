thanks anonfuck the rest of you dont read it then
So much whining jesus Christ grow up
I'm sorry that your brother and his fiancÃ© are morons.
Good read.
where do you see that literally anywhere in this thread
I cant believe I read all this fuck my life
you're on 4chan, you have nothing better to do with your life anyway
im waiting for the indices to open in one hour im bored every night, the least you could do is shorten that story up
fucking normie who has never looked at crypto a day in his life trying to give me trading advicethere you lazy faggot
what else op?
I could add more details but I'm lazy and the reception to the thread hasn't been that great so mehthat was basically the bulk of it, you aren't missing too much
SAGE for that disrespectful tone.I trade everything including crypto.
You assumed people only stick to one thing because thats what you do.
This was an error on your part :v)

4244394I mean you don't trade crypto, you hold it for a long ass time is all.Considering 90% of shit is shilling and PnD that's not the top 5 coins.So technically yea stocks are better :)
you dont have to spread the hodl meme anymore.
Everyone knows now all alts go down over time
I dont see how this is relevant at all.
TYou don't give advice on shit you have never looked at.
It's irresponsible and just stupid.
Not that I'd listen anyway.
Just annoying to hear.
?
?>you dont trade, you hodl% is p and d>dont trade, hodl>hodl pump and dumpnigga what.
4244394when I turned 2.5k into 10k/3btc in a week using wtc and link my parents told me to sell and I didn'tI guess a broken clock is right twice a daynow I have k and they want me to sell in case it goes lower'we told you'buy high sell low biz
>invested $600>Fucking normiesFk is biz full of kids who invests their pocket money?
not your personal blog, fagnot /r9k/ you twattoo long, didn't readeat shit you fuckwitno one cares fucking cunt
/biz/ is full of niggers who think they're smart for buying crypto after seeing a black guy shill coins on youtube, teenagers living in south american shitholes larping as "whales", HIV-positive faggots who live in silicon valley and found out about 4chan through CNN, fat neckbeard virgins who bought BTC when it was under $20 and held all the way until now, and scrawny canadians trying to turn 1000 CAD into 2000 CAD so they can finally move out of their parent's spare bedroom and start wagecucking full-time for a "tech startup".
This board is now garbage and maybe only 1 out of 100 threads are actually useful or funny.this thread right here is absolutely pointless bitching and lost my attention within the first 2 lines.
4244484I didn't read all of this shit but does it end with him fucking his brothers fiance or DGB or something?
SALTYALTY
That's why you don't tell your parents and own it up.Keep bagholding, my friend.
