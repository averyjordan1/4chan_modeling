Hi.
#4CHNallday..
i wonder if any chancoin bagholder will every be able to sell.
it seems like if there ever is someone buying, there'll be huge competition to cash out first
Just like with any coin, there are short, medium and long term holders.
In practicce - the whales are the lomg term holders.
I am holding it for 1-2 years before doing any trading with it.
Is it growing right now because Bitcoin is also rising?
I wont lie my friend, I've been trading on margin and it seems like there is no rush to sell.
Someones buying it even if its pretty much a 0.05cent Doge.
