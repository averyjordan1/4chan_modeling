I'm an Amerifat about to graduate from college soon, with a cushy job waiting for me when I get out.What bank should I use for my checking/savings?
So far I've been using an account attached to my parents' but now I want to make my own.
Assuming I want to travel on a semi-regular basis and student loans are a non-issue, what's the best one out there?
