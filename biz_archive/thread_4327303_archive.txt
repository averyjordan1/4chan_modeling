I've grown to have a heart for this man.I baited his misfortune for a few views on youtube, but now I'm beginning to feel guilty.It's not really about the money anymore.This is what happens when you get rich, and you're still lonely.I'm married, with a wonderful family, and even though I'm am the most disgusting kind of selfish there is, I know that something is worth holding on to, even though I am the furthest from feeling it.
I see Craig, and I don't want to go through that pain.
I will achieve his heights.
I will go where he's gone.
I want to accomplish his dreams.
But I will not sacrifice what I often feel I must sacrifice.I do not want to be this man.It's painful.
Watching him is genuinely painful.He's trying to live a life he lost, or maybe he's trying to relive it for some grasp at fulfillment.
I was in his group chat.
"I DON'T NEED PRAISE, I GOT ENOUGH PRAISE, I GOT ENOUGH CONFIDENCE!
"His outburst was a telling symptom.He was helping us though.
There's something unraveled up there.
Something raw and exposed, but he was trying to help us.
He really was.
That was his money, and he trusted us to stick to the regime.
Goddammit Craig.
I hope you're alright.
Don't be pussies /biz/Don't try to be chads.
Chads aren't chads.Be human /biz/You've got to believe in something.
You have to let things flow.Do that and the energy will be summoned to you.
