https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactionsBeen watching this since this morning.
Just keeps going up.
How are them transaction times and fees treating you BTC fanboys?
i even get JUST'D by them.
I've send my bitcoins to kraken a hour ago to sell them their and guess what???
I still dont have my 6 confirmations to sell them.TODAY IS A FUCKING BAD DAY.
This is what happens when you invest in a "store of value" and don't care about the fundamentals of being a currency.
Time for a rude awakening to all BTC maximalists.
I only wanted to make some quick money to visit prostis and get high but instead im getting fucking raped everywhere.
This is not fair.
Well, the only good thing is that i have a new perspective for my bachelor thesis and how the fiat system might actually be breddy gud.
This is the typical BTC holder
I bought some more BCH today but I used eth to do it.
Knew going into BTC would be a nightmare.
Good choice.
My first transaction took 2 fucking hours.
