>if you could go back in time 1 month you could turn 10k into 400k just by buying bch then neo then powrwhy do I keep missing out?
it's best not to dwell on these thingsi made $1 million just this year and if i ever thought about how much money i could've made if id just held on to something longer or sold at a loss quicker id still want to kms, i could have $100 mil by now easily
You didn't miss powr you mongoloid, there's still so many gains to come.
You probably lost a 0 in POWR (like most of us).
Hop the train.
That coin is about to lift.
Global adoption of cryptos is still only something like .30%.
We got a long way to go until the gains are all gone and the market is settled.
Pay attention very closely to POWR for the next few hours, it's primed for another leg up.
Aww man, I'm so fucking close to kms rn, especially when I think that with every day that passes we are getting closer and closer to regulations being introduced and when that happens all these crazy gains opportunities will disappear overnight.
>why do I keep missing out?If gravity worked different I could fly.But it doesn't and I can'tTime doesn't work different either.
AAAHHHI hate you.
POWR is just starting buy now and enjoy 10x in 12 monthsBuy GVT now and enjoy 50x in 12 months
tfw bought bch and neo fairly low>greed got the best of and didnt sell at athim still up but im starting to feel i might have some close jewish relatives
This is me.
Had I waited like 1 more hour to execute some of my orders, I could have been at 100k+.
Still made 20k so can't really be too upset.
