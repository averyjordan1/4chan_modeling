Okay I took profits on POWR, you guys should be buying coins that are still down right now like ARK, and komodo.
Komodo because their BarterDEX application is progressing at a fast pace and will increase the value of komodo once people catch on and ARK just because of its upcoming updates, its not priced in and is still low.
Also bitshares because its a newly listed coin on Binance, its a very good coin with good fundimentals and people will buy into it sooner or later.
What ARK updates?
Mobile wallets, business entity,ARKVM and even more my nigga
