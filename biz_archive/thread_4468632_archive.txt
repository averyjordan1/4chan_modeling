>risk free
There is a shitton of risk with what you are doing
Yeah, because it doesn't go above 1 by design so you'll never be liquidated.
And in the event that the tether house of cards collapses you'll make bank.
there literally isn't.
USDT literally cannot moon, ever.
its pegged to 1 dollar, tether prints more to keep it there.
IF there is a scam, and USDT loses all its value, then OP will be rich.
However he pays fees to short for something that may never happen.
What kind of fees are we talking?
tether in the past has moon to 1.03, seems extremely risky and how much can u make
you cash tards cannot just buy btc and enjoy gains like everyone else.
you're literally going to pay fees for something that will never happen because of your delusions.
That's not a moon.
And it's guaranteed to go back down to 1.
Think of it as insurance.
KRAKEN WONT VERIFY MY FUCKING ACCOUNT EVENT THOUGH I SENT ALL MY INFO IN ON FRIDAY.FUUUUUCK!
How high are the fees :))))?
