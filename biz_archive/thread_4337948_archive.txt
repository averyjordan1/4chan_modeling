> gonna dump it to $1 they said.Go read bitcointalk Bitcoin Cash ann thread from 1st August.Core/Bilderberg shills said > BCH would be worthless, they would all dump it to $1 as soon as blocks start flowing in.Months later...they are still afraid.
And we are winning against banksters again.
And their BankCoin is unusable.
>implying bcash is not backed by bilderberg attempt centralize bitcoin so people can't run full nodes
Gib your address and Ill send you 50usd, tha is a average BTC fee worth of BCH.so you can buy a (used) harddrive today which will last you for the next 10years of storing BCH blockchain.Just 1 transaction fee, for 1 harddrive with enough storage for 8mb blocks at full.Also, when your raspberry pi Bitcoin Core crashes due to not enough memory for mempool due to unconfirmed tx then you pay me back.
Ok?
that's not how you use this pepe, you're a disgrace.
