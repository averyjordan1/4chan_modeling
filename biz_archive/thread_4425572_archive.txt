What's the deal with this coin?
Can someone give me a run down and if it's a good buy right now?
I'm looking at the bitfinex charts and it always seems to get pump and dumped between $3 and $3.50.
top 10 coin in 2018 DYOR
one of the most obvious pump and dump scams ive seen.
flip it if you feel like gambling but dont hold for more than a week.
lol you're fucking retarded
One of the most undervalued coins atm.
Expecting 10x atleast in 2018

I did, I've searched biz, searched reddit and even read some articles but the project seems so under the radar I just wanted clarification as to what it is.
