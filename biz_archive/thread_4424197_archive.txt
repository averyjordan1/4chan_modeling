Is it enough guys?
Should I buy more GAS?
I did not understand gas and neo concept, can some one explain me?
I thought if we buy neo we get GAS?
Brap.
Your a brainlet
Do you op, you're doing wellYour a shitposting niggeryes, hold neo, generate gasthat does not mean buying gas is a bad idea
Dude if people dont understand the logic about NEO/GAS concept , 1min on google and you find it and understand it.That in my book is a brainlet
Okay listen newfag I'll give you some honest advice for once.
Buy both.
Gas bc you need Gas to run Neo.
By end of next year there will only be 20M GAS units and once China FUD is over all these ICOs on NEO will use Gas.
If NEO gets mass adoption you're looking at $200-$400 per Gas unit.
Neo will win as the Asian Ethereum so it's got that going for it.
I'd recommend 50/50.
yo retard, I know we can the info from google.
but hearing from biz makes me comfy.
% of things you're gonna hear from biz is shitposts.
the other 10% is fud
this t b h. I've been keeping and holding a steady supply of both and predict a yuge increase within even the next few months - higher than the past neo high of  in less than a month, no doubt.
Yes, we will need a lot when we eradicate the (((core))).
