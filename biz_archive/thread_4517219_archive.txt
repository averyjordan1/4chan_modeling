Is ED being shittier than usual for anyone else?Anyways, I am now a spanking the monkey.And i bought Spank.
So it's like 1/4 ICO price then.
Might be worth buying
Market cap at around .00008 eth would be something like $6 million, assuming all 200,000,000 is circulating
Mommy let me have a cookie
Wait actually This says the supply is one billion.
Does anyone here know what the fuck the circulating supply is
Forgot link https://www.coinschedule.com/icos/e498/spank-coin-ico.html
Nvm, the whitepaper says 100,000,000 were released.
Market cap should be ~$3m in that case.
holy fuck who is she
conan o'brian

you are totally wrong.
it says in their blog that the market cap is $23m.
stop being a fucking idiothttps://medium.com/spankchain/the-spankchain-auction-is-now-complete-8ad0a12918cf

That's more than their whitepaper said so it's not really my fault.
And $23m includes their tokens
