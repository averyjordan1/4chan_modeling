so I sent all my chainlink to my nano s in the receiving address.
It says complete on etherscan and has a lot of confirmations but it's still not in my wallet.
What do I do?
How do you know "it's still not in my wallet"?
Do you know where to check?
>not sending a tiny amount first to check if it worksLmao retard, your money is gone.
I just checked my balance on the wallet.
someone mentioned something about importing a contract but I don't know what that is
I know I fucked up just trying to fix it right now.It's my first time transfering an ER20 token to my nano s
thanks for the donation that makes every existing LINK a bit more worth.

You need to load the tokens in MEW.
You can't see ETH token balances on the ledger.
Check your ETH address in etherscan or MEW to see token balances.
As long as you used the right address your tokens are there.
If you're using the Ledger Ethereum program you can't see it.
You got to use MyEtherWallet and access your Ledger from there to see and move your LINKs.

Hope you like your new playstation EOY I guess
why the fuck did you send the tokens to the same wallet you were holding them in?

You retard.
It's an ERC20 token.
It's not gonna show up in your nano.
You need to either use MEW or etherscan to see your tokens.
