You lost bitcoin

Tech you lost BTC but you made USD Value - You lost $600+ of possible gains though, so while you made money you basically lost a lot more than you made.

You made money and missed the opportunity to make even more money.
But you could argue that you are constantly missing opportunities to make more money since something always moons, so who gives a fuck.
99.9% of people here don't trade perfectly (or even remotely good).
