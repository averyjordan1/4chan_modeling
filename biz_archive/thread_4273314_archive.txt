Why are there literally no posts about this ?
Useful application (invoice trading) , recently climbed up on market cap.
Working platform coming soon.
Nice passive income through lending.
Is this all vapour wave and it's a scam coin?
>why are there no posts about a solid coin that has real use cases?
shhhhhhhhhh
if u believe in the crypto nut case clif high then this is a good pick
Lol.
He made up some bullshit about "predicting" future linguistic activity surrounding Veritaseum price movement with "linguistic forecasting" technology.
Sure enough there was a "hack" and it all got dumped on etherdelta.
Except the "hack" was just the nig founder (who holds something like 98% of the total coin supply) dumping coins.
All pre-arranged with jew shill clif high.
Nut case is right.
I actually like Clif High and I'm starting to believe this.
Still, he was really helpful in getting me into crypto when I still knew nothing about it.
Made me feel like I had an edge on things, so I kept interest in it all.
Then I got intelligent enough about it to research things myself, and I largely stopped listening.
I still like it when a coin I independently researched is predicted well by him.And I still grab his reports on filesharing groups.
No more $100 a pop for him though.
Can confirm.
I've met Reggie several times in NYC.
He's been pumping versions of coins since at least 2012 when I first met him.
Knows literally nothing about the space.
Contrived dribble and constantly makes bold statements using complex buzzwords to have some kind of perceived intellectual authority.
Also, he's best friends with Black Science Man..
