ASIC resistant hype, market cap is still ridiculous.
are you really still thinking about those scam forks?
vertcoin is just a pnd vehicle.. tons of currency with WAY better tech (e.g.
Monero) have been out for AGES.
question is if you wanna ride the hype
no reason for there to be only one winner, have both in your portfolio.VTC is just poised to do better gains.If you want to risk it, throw some in GRS because for some reason they seem to go hand in hand.There's just been a lot of sentiment building up that is pointing towards a VTC breakout.
eh I would say that the other ASIC branded coins fall under the "pnd vehicle" criticism (feather and grs for example).
vertcoin has the name recognition for ASIC and a pretty large community.
All signs point to this being a solid hold, and at least in the short term (45 days) you will see a doubling in value, so that alone with worth jumping in.
Just bought back in at 63k, looking pretty good.
