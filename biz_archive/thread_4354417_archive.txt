Is everyone going to swap Ethereum for Ethereum classic?
I'm hoping.
I'm down big on etc
ETH is run by a gay 23 year old marxist, who wants to censor things he doesn't like (unless it's CP).ETC isn't run by this person.Figure it out.
What can you do with ETC though?
I don't know much about ETC other than it was the hardliners with DAO.
Does ETC offer the same ERC20 token system?
Can dApps programmed on ETH carry over to ETC?
It can do everything eth can do with an immutable chain, hard cap, POW and no pedo skelly.
ETH is the future!
FYI;;;;;;;;;;;>>>>>>Ethereumwhat do you think about this "Ether is FUEL for the network.
If it becomes too expensive then it will be redundant "?of course it can be more expensive, There is no hard limit on ETH, And its divideable to 18 decimals, No reason why it cant go to 10k eachEther is used to pay the worldwide ethereum virtual maschine to provide verifiable computations.
Miners are being payed Ether in fees which is the incentive to continue mining.When the switch to "Proof of Stake" comes there will be no mining anymore and because staking does not cost too many computational resources the fee for computation on the blockchain will decrease dramatically .....As the switch to "proof of stake" is planned in the next 12 to 24 months, the ether amount needed to do a transaction would also decrease by a hundredfold, Which is the reason why the price can go up 100x and the chain will not die !!!
!do you not think as a result more and more miners will move away from ETH to other cryptos...?The mining hardware are scrypt ASICs, Which can only be used for scrypt based Blockchains, wont work for BTC, monero, LTC or whateverThe lowest amount of bitcoin is 1 Satoshiwhich is 0.00000001 BTCThe lowest amount of ETH is one Weiwhich is 0.000000000000000001 ETH
