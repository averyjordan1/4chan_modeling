why do i always see pic related recentlyhow can you compare the internet with digital gift cards?tell me why the fuck do we need blockchain?
you think the majority gives a fuck about buzzwords like decentralized?the only real coin with actual use case is monero.tell me why the fuck we need anything else?
all these coins have zero value and are only bought in hopes to be resold to a bigger tard.dont fall for the dividend meme.
neo/gas is actual the biggest marketing ponzi and reddit neckbeards love it lmao.
my Request network Tokens will bu used to pay for fees on a decentralized Paypal that has systems built in to allow continous payment.
Crypto currency can fail and REQ will stay cause it works for fiat and cryptos.Other than that I'm a big monero fan and think it's an even better store of value than bitcoin.
this guy is telling the truth.
we are already in the mania phase.
everyone wants a lambo and shitcoins without a working product get millions in funding
everyone wants a lambo whether they're in crypto or not.
Truest words ever written on /biz/.
It's mind boggling how the retards here can't understand this simple fact.
