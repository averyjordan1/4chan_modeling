I still doubt Walton Chain, we have seen no progress in their development, no RFID chips, nothing but a few shitty marketing videos with stock footage and some chinks in matching t shirts.
I’ll get on board when I see a real prototype.For now I’m Team Modum IO, but I’m not committed.
If Walton actually produces something I will get on board because I’m very down with this internet of things/blockchain/supply chain movement.
Was all in the whole time.
Thank god it was one of the best recovering alts.
