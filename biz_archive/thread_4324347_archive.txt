Major developments happened over the last 48 hrs with regards to RFID tech and some major patents owned by Waltonchain.
Long story short is there has already been a back room deal done by WTC execs and 5 major retail outlets.
Walton group being how they are is not releasing all the details until these companies have changed over their process for a smooth transition.
Big info.
Good luck and buy now or forever regret
Unironicly......priced in.Truth to be told when it moons soon in next 60-120 days, and it will fucking explode -people will FOMO after 400% , than panic sell dips, than FOMO again.Cos they "know better" and can "time market" while chasing PND shitcoins.
Seen it whit monero, eth and list goes on....Crypto markets man.... its 3 digit coin and none cares while its 1 digit, as history of 3 digit coin shows us.
It’s really interesting to me that there’s still people doubting the project.
You should see the info I’ve learned from Walton team leaders in the slack via direct message.
If you ask they will tell and just ask for you not to share private messages.
There is a major storm of success brewing
tell you fag
We want to know
