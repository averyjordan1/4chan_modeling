lie.
i didnt see it on hitbtc.
Alright, normally I don't chase pumps but I'm liking the looks of this.
If Funfair's my long hold then EthBet could be seeing gains sooner rather than later.
Gambling coins are so good.

ED
person selling at 27 put his wall downlolstraight to the top
i bought at ICOand it still 50% below ICObut i guess with such a low marketcap the price can jump pretty fast.im holding till 2018 anyway
yeah, ICO could have been an easy 2x or 3x i dont blame you.
if you didn't buy too much at ICO you can buy some now to lower your average entry point is what I did.hopefully after this product comes out it gets even better, you have to realize likethe path to getting back to ICO price only needs like $6,000 in buys or some shit, it's nothing
