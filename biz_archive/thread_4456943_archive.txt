Dude you need to get in on TIO Etherdelta now.
Only 450k in supply price is at $0.1, yet to be listed on coinmarketcap, strong project/community, german team, exciting roadmap, Will probably be doing well over $1 once it gets to coinmarketcap.
I dont think there's anyrhing else that can guarantee that much ROI at this moment.
Thank me later
And TIO is going to be on Binance/HitBTC...they're getting on Yobit this week.
Forget the hyping you'll get on all these other coins.
They've already done their shine on coinmarketcap, and hit their wall.
A project with a low supply thats yet to be on CMC is a fucking goldmine for those who knew early.
You're know now.
