Here guys im a be of a new fag to the trading of alts, and was wondering if i could get a bit of advice.So last night I tried give this a go and I made an account on coin base and have purchased two small amounts of bitcoin ( one lot at $60 and another at $70) just to test the waters.I also open an account on binance and transfered my coin over.
What I dont understand is the fees, they are so high.
To make both of those transfer to coin base it was $3 each.
But the once I transfer it to Binance its an extra like $10 fee each transfer.How are you meant to make cash when by the time my bitcoin hits my binance account I'm already down like 50%, is this normal or is coinbase just expensive and if so could you please direct me to a better wallet and place to buy bitcoin please
How are you meant to make cashYou're not
.
everyone gets raped by fees2.
use ethereum when transferring money to exchanges
Does binance take eth?
I thought you could only transfer bitcoin to it?Also the fee was more like $20 transfering to binance, what kinda bullshit scam is that
What exchanges take eth
All of them.Yes you can deposit Ethereum.
Thanks heaps
Bitcoin is not for small amounts or poor people
Bank to coinbase usd wallet is free.
Then usd on coinbase to gdax is free.
Then buy on the gdax market and transfer your coins to an exchange with a low fee.
Best way.
Also how much link do i need to make it my bros. Also I'm thinking of buying salt and gas, is this wise?Also any other suggestions
