>put up 5 BTC in order to take a 5 BTC loanWhat is the point
unchained-capital already does this shitFuck salt
end of this year.hint fucking hint:salt is 2xing AT LEAST before the end of the year.
thats if the launch is botched.
I fully expect it to hit 25 bucks by january 1st, as their platform is going live.
Also its already 15 cents on the day and 30% on the week.
if you dont understand what that means, then go back to shiling nuls shitcoins.
they are saying Q4.
Get on their telegram they are pretty active.
