So I'm triggered because I lost almost all my money on POT and I'm trying to make it back by playing around on bitmex but I have so many questions.Wtf does long and short mean??
Where do I withdraw to my mew?I just bought long bitcoin I'm guessing that's the smart choice?
Wtf is ROE?
And why is it 10% already?
How do I take profits?Also trading at 100x.
How much to hate fuck that white bitch?

Bait but you're about to lose all your money
I just marketed my position and bought shorts.
Already at 0.82% ROEWhy is my ROE green but my available balance went down??
Hover your cursor over the roi to see what your profit is actually at.
Available balance went down because some your btc is in positions.
Use limit buy and close when you see some profit.
Then gtfo and never look before you lose it all.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Hovering my cursor over ROE didn't do anything.
And my ROE is at 10% now so that means I made 10% profit right?
But when I sell I have the exact same balance as before wtf?
Just quit trading
Use limit buy and close when you see some profit.DELETE THIS DELETE THIS DELETE THIS DELETE THIS DELETE THIS
