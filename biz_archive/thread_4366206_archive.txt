So lets talk about what it is that make some coins complete and utter useless shitcoins.
I'll start:1.
It's anything gaming related.
No gaming industry needs a fucking eth token, if you own these you're retarded.2.
It's just a currency to be used on some shitty platform (Decentralized marketplace, lending, gambling, ect.
), and nothing else.
There is zero economic properties giving these coins value, and if you own them you're a retard.
3.
It's called Edgeless.
Plz those of you who own this try and defend yourselves so we can all point and laugh.Add to the list.
4.
It does exactly what another coin already does but with some slight insignificant improvement, (Small privacy changes, cheaper transactions, ect.)
