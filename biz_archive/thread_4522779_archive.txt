Do you have an emergency plan if crypto for some crazy reason implodes?What are your other investments and what would you suggest?
Got nearly 20K in crypto and I'm looking for ideas what to do with another 40K that's sitting around for now.
Everything except crypto.
Less than 2% of my net worth is in crypto.
The rest is in ETFs etc.
in tax-free accounts.
Three major benefits:1.
Iron Hands.
If you’re investing what you can afford to lose you can shrug off swings easily and hold.2.
If there’s a crash, you have cash on the sidelines to buy crypto at fire sale prices3.
Crypto brings joy and not stress.
Moons and crashes are both just hilarious and entertaining.
You don’t have to fucking neck yourself if there’s a crash.
Until you have 100k, seriously just keep it simple and keep it all in an S&P 500 ETF.
Don’t even think about selling ever, hold it to retirement, buy more at regular intervals.
