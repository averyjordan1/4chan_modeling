Is this ARK Wallet Ad a scam, if people download and deposit are they losing their coins?Also which ARK Wallet do you guys suggest, I want to move my coins off the exchange - I'm in deep on ARK and want it to remain safe.
download the official wallet from ark.io also vote for a del for more ark gains
Yes, that's a scam, the Ark team is warning people about it.Use the official one from ark.io.
It looks like mobile wallets will be here by December too
4381832thanks for the intel I went through their website and got Ark Client 1.4.1 - I wish Exodus supported ARK, but I've also got my Ledger and I heard people saying ARK is moveable to the Ledger, so I'm going to throw a few thousand in there.
If you want to use ledger you need to use Ark Client... the official wallet.
It's als one of the best wallets of all crypto projects, and I've seen some shit.And please, using the Ark Client, vote for a delegate.
It'll cost you 1 ARK to vote... but you get free ARK in return every day.
With 1110 ARK I get 0.3 ARK per day.
