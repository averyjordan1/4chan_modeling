Why IoP?
Coming soon:> Bluepaper in 2 days> Roadmap to follow soon> Official marketing campaing> New big exchanges> They already have beta messenger released (it provides better privacy then any out there, basically real what's up 2.0)> Partnership with Libertania> Amazing devs (they will do livestream where they will make what IOTA wants to make in just a couple of days)> Making separate exchange where coins (same as ICO) could be purchased with IOP> Hydra airdrop (for any IOP on the wallet you have a chance to get airdrop of hydra) and that is just the start> Low circulation (around 2m coins)> Just got out of stealth > low market cap of less then 5m$> Active community, there is always someone on telegram or discord and you can even have conversation with project developers and even project leader> FFS buy it or cry laterDon't trust me?
> DYOR> Check their price few months ago and the current price, it all happened because of a scammer who stole coins and dumped them all and hijacked the network.
They took all back and have worked on project non stop.
I expect the previous price to be met soon.> Moon tonight and this price never to be seen again, buckle up!> This is the early retirement coin, welcome to the club, we made it anon.
dafuq is blue paper?
bluepaper in 4 hours or 2 days?im confused
Mix of whitepaper and blueprint less then 4hours senpai
Well since it's a bluepaper, I'm guessing both are correct.
By definition it exists at every possible moment and every possible location at once.
bluepaper = whitepaper+blueprint(roadmap)
it is 3 ours 29mins left there is a countdown timer at official website http://iop.global/
I won't be sleeping tonight
Titania whitepaper coming tonight as well!!!!
priced in
not yet, any big investor will not be investing in a project without whitepaper nor roadmap.
After tonight there are some that will
how pathetic
so why shouldn't i buy then?
Don't buy if you hate free money, literallyMarket cap is under 10m$ and this project is far more ambitious and developed that many 50m$ market cap coins
i agree but u just said after tonight some big investors will throw money at it.
So why shouldn't I buy now before that money comes in?
Not trying to be an ass just curious
I think that you should too as there is always a question if the whales will like the bluepaper.
My opinion is that they will be buying for sure as this project is trying to make something huge and provoke mass adoption, the market cap is very low so the risk is not too high either while the potential profit is enormous
50 more minutes !!!
