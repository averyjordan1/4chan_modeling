What can I use which is a lightweight wallet to store ERC20 tokens in (prefer not to use myetherwallet) on 32 bit windows?
I don't have the space for the whole bloody blockchain
if you want to lose your money, yes you can do that.i would advise you to use a live usb linux instead
yeah, great plan.
lets tell everyone that struggles with wallet software to put their private keys and coins into a linux live disc.
that will end well.
