It's different this time.Usually a shitcoin goes down and you are in the red, you are usually down 20%.
60% if you were truly retarded on a trade.But you were able to still recuperate something.This time was different.It went from hero to zero in one announcement.Signatum gave more time to get out.
And you could have gotten out with at least 40% of your original buy in.Fuck you confido you sneaky niggerish jew.
Never before have so many people gotten fucked instantly.I need another drink.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
