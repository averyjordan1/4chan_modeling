WHEN THE FUCK IS THIS MOONING BIZ.
Its almost december ffs.
Ive been holding this for a 2 weeks already.
Me to my friend.
Me to
Then you could already have sold at 50%+ I got in at 2.5 and sold second it hit 4It's a solid project but it just hasnt seen adaptation yet, might go crazy when they release the platform though
Bought at $5 someone tell me i will at least break even
How the fuck could you buy at $5?
I bought in at $2.5 like the other anon.
It barely stayed at $4.5 for fucks sake.
Its ATH was about 7 or 8, before the last pump.
Likely going to that or higher when we get news about the platform
remember, the platform is out BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.
all you ADHD riddled fags who couldnt hold longer than a couple weeks are gonna get btfo.
There's 2 problems atm1: The platform's value is uncertain when they're only allowing BTC as collateral and the BCH vs BTC war is still very much alive.2: People are too busy betting on BTC and BCH going up and down to place their shekels in Salt right now, and they all know everyone else thinks that everyone else thinks that too, so they don't expect Salt to rise any time soon.This is why I sold all my Salt at 4USD when BCH started rocketing from 600USD and it was clear that the war was on.
