im financially illiterate how do i do it other than being a wage slave
Invest in a good degree to get a good, high paying job.Then work a lot to earn money and invest it, making it work for you over time.Or skip these steps, take a 100k loan and invest into LINK.
In a week you will be a gorillionaire.
Don't listen to this cuck, OP.
Formal education is a meme.
Your only hope is to day trade crypto
