/biz/ what's a good Margin Trading techinque?
I wanna turn my $220 into $200,000 fast.
I'm willing to risk it all but I also want to be smart about it.
I use Bitmex btw.
Is it the best?
Thx anon
Honestly, place a buy order of bitcoin at $7,000 with 100x leverage.It's possible Bitcoin never returns below $7,000.
