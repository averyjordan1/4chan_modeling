I'm looking to get out of BTC/BCH until one of them is clearly top dog.
I would also consider going into XMR or Dash.
Always buy ethereum.
This shit will be over a grand each by january
Long term ethereum will be a trillion dollar market cap
BCH will never top BTC.
ETH and DASH are the safest to buy ATH right now, both very stable in relation to this BTC/BCC drama.
