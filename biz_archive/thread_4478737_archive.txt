I'm tempted to dump all of my alts for ETH but I don't think I could handle it if LINK or some shit takes off in the meantime...
I'M TOOO SCARED MOMMMY
Nice digits, also put everything in BTC and ETH
bumpis this website going to fuck me over please respond
I just honestly don't think I can.
I would have to sell shit at losses and I don't think I'd be able to sleep after doing it so I'm just going to do nothing, have a pint, and wait for all this tether nonsense to blow over.
Youre going to make five dollars.
I have 3 ETH and 0.07 BTC through coinbase.
Fuck alt coins
dont use coinbase, go to etherdelta and trade usd for btc, then trade for eth, really low fees and has the best conversion ratios
so I'm just going to do nothing, have a pint, and wait for all this tether nonsense to blow over.same m8, cheers.

All The Big Three are going down.
We saw the same thing happened over a month ago.
Sell any of them into US dollars.
Even if the ether price vs Bitcoin goes up ether is still going down so u.s. dollars is going to net you the most.
