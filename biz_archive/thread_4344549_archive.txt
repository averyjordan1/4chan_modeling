I predicted the mempool would never clear out 200 sat/byte and here we are!
And miners are not even switch over to BCH yet.Get ready for extreme levels of butthurt, even worse than Saturday.My prediction: transaction fees at 1500 sat/b by the time BCC difficulty goes down again (tomorrow).
Minimum $100 fees soon, based Segwit working as intended
Typo...
I mean to say "by the time BCC difficulty goes UP again".Are y'all ready?
"Dude this is the transaction fee market working perfectly as designed!"
Minimum $100 fees soonThis won't happen by the way.
By the time your fees hit 4000 sat/byte your BTC just won't be worth much anymore.
