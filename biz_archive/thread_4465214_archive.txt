this coin is tanking hard
hasn't done much at all since i've bought in.
i was probably better off sitting on a limit order but i got my bags now lets moon
why did the price drop after burning 700 million of the token supply.
a whale fucked it and the team has literally never heard of marketing"hey guys were buring 90% of our supply but we arent going to promote that or tweet the crap out oh this once in a lifetime easy hype and marketing that costs fuck all"
Yeah, they didn't even advertise their own ICO beyond making a thread on bitcointalk and posting in it once every few days.
Their marketing truly sucks.
The question is, can they put out a decent product?
yep some wannabe whale is playing games.
Scroll up the sells and you see all small orders for 300 coins, someone wants you to sell into the bid.
and some weak handed pajeet is taking out the buy wall.
Guys get your bids in, you might get a cheap order filled.
I sold all of my FENX from the airdrop for 6 ether.
I don't know why people are buying this for so much but dam it was easy money.
I want to give each of the Devs a kiss on the lips no homo.
