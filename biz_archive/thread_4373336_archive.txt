That's son of a bitch I I panic sold a quarter of my postion at 6500... didn't buy low.
Fuck BCH, I can't believe I even payed attention to that scam coin...https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/QoR4qQa9-BTC-long-term-pattern-1D-candles-log-scale/
you can still switch to the winning side before it's too late corecuck, the megapump to finally crush the core and blockstream parasites and restore Satoshi's bitcoin isn't quite ready to go yet
Satoshi's visionBoth coins are shit as a decentralized people's coin.
BCH holders right now just like to pretend they care when they just want to essentially have bought in on 'BTC' at lower prices
reminder that the Lightning Network will be ready in less than a month, you are fucked lmao
having been able to buy so low on the real bitcoin in 2017 certainly feels good, but not as good as the sense of positive morality I feel in helping rid crypto of the tumors known as core and blockstreamgood luck with that corecuck
less than a monthenjoy your subscription fees paid to centralized financial entities
helping rid crypto of the tumorsSo when do we out the mining conglomerates too and give the coin back to the people?
I WILL NEVER SELL THE DIP AGAIN
lightning network will make bitcoin cease being a cryptocurrency so good job submitting to the kikes faggot
sounds like bitcoin gold is the coin for you little guy
How about instead we just drop Bitcoin as the king altogether and start over?
reminder that there's a good chance it won't matter.
meanwhile bankster's coin ripple proved to be more decentralised
feel so comfy in BCH knowing Roger "Core Crusher" Ver and the mining crew's master plan is going swimmingly
>trading a known scam like btrash
I feel kinda bad actually.I went to a presentation by the guy who has done most of the work on the lightning network back when he used to be a linux kernel developer on I think it was IP routing at the time.
Super smart guy.It's really ripped my blindfold off to see the kinds of people that I used to think incorruptible fall victim to such a blatant hijack and subvert campaign.These people label themselves "decentralised" and "cipherpunk", while effectively wagecucking for the bildebergers to prevent the exact dream they're fronting for.
it's really easy for manipulative people to trick smart but unworldly people into doing their bidding4374072 satoshi has been deposited into your coreblue account.
thank you come again
a lot of people are completely compartmentalized and have no idea what they are doing, blockstreams ever persistent censorship and FUD is not helping our cause, we must get the truth out on /biz/, twitter, and everywhere else as well
Roger Ver is a patriot, he's like George Washington kickout out the blockstream royalty
