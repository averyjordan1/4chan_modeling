Core Tactic #5: XenophobiaPretend a country of more than a billion people all thinks the same and all have agreed to secretly conspire to do...something.

LOL Bitcoin is originally from JAPAN
On Chinese social media, the biggest Chinese mining teams stopped mining bitcoin and instead plan on mining btc cash and are not ever again interested in mining bitcoin
When the biggest mining teams that make up 10-15% of all overall btc just switch over to bitcoin cash, it's fucking problematic to the crypto economy
Disgusting blackmailingI hope those particular miners will be dealt accordingly, and will be denied mining BTC in the future.
It is their wish anyway
