Holy fuck senpai, if your gains aren't worth the stress then just quit altogether.
This is not going to be a smooth takeoff.
And it's probably not even possible to do x100 anymore with any of the mainstream cryptos.At this point I'm just doing lazy trades myself during dumps only.Good sleep is more valuable to me personally.
