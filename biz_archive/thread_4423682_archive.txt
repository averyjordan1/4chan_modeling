Anyone else absolutely JUSTed this month?
I'm down around 23k usd and at first i was panicking and shit.
But after a month of JUST i realized it doesnt feel that bad after all.
Although i do feel a little numb right now.Any anons who feel the same?
It's gonna get better desu.
what happened to get you down 23k?
so we dont make the same mistake thanks anon
My portfolio is 100% altcoins.
Probably bought something dumb like LINK.
It is that bad anon.
It only doesn't feel bad because they're numbers on a screen.
Once you return to wagecucking and realize how many hours you have to work to make back that 23k,it hurts
Once you return to wagecucking and realize how many hours you have to work to make back that 23k,it hurtsWhy would i wagecuck when i can just steal more money by making fake ICO websites lmao.
If money comes that easily to yo u then why'd you lose 23k of it?
Huh?
i lost 23k because my investments tanked this month.
If you're making si much money ni wonder 23k Feels like nothing.
You're not the average Joe wageslave
