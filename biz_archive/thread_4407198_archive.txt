Hey biz Going to go sleepies now.
Some how after getting into crypto a month ago and making constant shit trades and waiting for shit coins to moon and not bring successfull.. ( except for nuls) im still up.
Why?
Thanks to daddy BTC So im gonna sleep comfy on my stack of 99 % btc.
And when i wakey btc will be going for 8400kAnd then, im thinking it might be time for a beaten down alt..Shill me the top 3 alts if u had to stake your life on them rebounding after daddy snaps some more necks.
And cashes coinbase checks.
Do Not fucking tell me about december... or q1 blah... top3 recovering tomorrow, into sat.
wakes up BTC flipped and ETH is the new King at $7,000
Doubtful eth aint doin shit for a while.
