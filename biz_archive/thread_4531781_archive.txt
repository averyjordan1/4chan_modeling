4K to spend now, Iâ€™ll be off the grid underwater in a sub for the next 6 months, looking at 2k in link and 2k in BTS.
Also thinking about POWR.
Tell me what to do make me shit myself when I get out of that sub next year.

get LINK, doublemarine
powr has more long term future.
Already partnering with 3 of the largest energy companies in the pacific.
Imo if you are going to buy powr, wait till it dips again.
It might even drop to 07000 for a while, as it is currently being abused by bots on binance.
ARK and stake it.
You'll passively get more ARK.
Same with BLK, but BLK is a safer investment and listed on polo.
Good marginal trading for that as well.
In 6 months eth will be over $1K, litecoin will be over $300screencap this.
