I've heard a lot of good stuff about publica the last few days!
when will it hit ED ?
Only 498 token holders.
The few that will be selling will not drop their bags cheap.Gonna sit this one out for a while.
where do you see that?
https://publica.io/ it's right there ffs
Imho some will sell cheap.
You just have to be on ED early enough to catch it.
Fckk missed out on this one.
Why was it filled all of a sudden?
Going to buy some up to 3x cuz 10x is for sure on this one
Will it be possible to get this off ED or whatever exchange they start with first when it drops or are tokens locked?
Cryptopia == moon!
this shit got so much hype, ppl are willing to pay x4 ICO price on their telegram group.
i'll pass, the FOMO is strong with this one
Yea, this one looks pretty good.
Hopefully there will be weak hands selling on ED.
Hope I can scoop some cheap
The project fundamentals are good, great team and also a low cap, no wonder for the hype it's getting.
When will it hit ED?
What's the smart contract address as well?

BUY IT ANYWAY.
HARD CAP WAS 1M.
This will easily go to 1$
It's certainly possible with such a low market cap.
FUCK ME I BOUGHT THE TOP
What is the logic of selling big amounts like 70 eth below the ico price?
It is below it right?
Nope, it's above ico price
Its currently about x3.5 ICO price.
Hasn't dipped below ICO yet and probably never will.
Buy before the bump when it goes on CMC (dev has applied after volume requirement was met) and before the moon when it goes on cryptopia (pic related).
Nice dip now, this is a no brainer for 2-3x in the next two days.
You lucky fucking cunt.
What is that shit now?
Nearly $3000?

On CMC now: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/publica/Should give some more momentum.
4513186this was like the first day of confido.
everyone didn't want to buy at 3-4x and 1 week later we were 10x
you can almost feel it-- it's about to take the fuck off.

Cryptopia is underway + other exchanges.

I hope biz is buying it cheaply now.
Minor dip from weak ICO bonus hands.
Now is real launch time.
"Other exchanges - speakung / filed with 3, will see, there definitely will be one exchange.
But when and which we will see in coming hours.
"Team member on Telegram
Also "Another simple reason - one reputable exchange asked that in addition to legal opinion that the token is utility.
We have this.
But they also want KYC."
Bittrex?
Sounds like Bittrex to me!
::)
What's the circulating supply?
Total market cap is already 11 million.
If it makes you feel any better I waited way the fuck too long to buy the rest and had to just put the rest of my ~8 eth in at .0009 instead of the .0005 it was going for right after I made that first lucky buy.
Got greedy and got fucked for it.
Still, my average buy price is about .00066 thanks to that so I'm pretty comfy
Circulating token supply is 17.9mil and total token supply is 33mil, market cap is not $11m.
Starting market cap was $1mil.

Be straight with me boys: What price will this bitch hit if it gets listed on Bittrex
