At what price are you core cucks going to FOMO in?
0.3?
0.4?
0.5?
1?
.01
So when 0.01 BCH = 1 BTC?
Nice
Whenever I see this meme I admire the work of the colorist.
It’s a shame the DP gets all the credit.
I dunno I might buy it if the inverse relationship is sustained.
If I can go half & half and never lose any value relative to a tertiary currency, great.
I hedge against the movements of both coins - which means I stop gaining unless both coins rise in general but I also stop losing if one coin takes a shit.Not sure I believe in BCH just yet.
>buying bootleg bitcoin can't wait for the wojaks
If youre gunna hedge do 70/30 btc/bch not 50/50
I’m not doing it unless I think BCH has a real feasible chance at dominating BTC and it’s place in the market.
If I can’t comfortably break it 50/50 it’s unwarranted to hedge.
0.2, no takers?
.08 all in no stop loss
got 300bch ready to sell at 0.5 and 0.9if flippening happens, oh well i got more bch and ill accept the fate of bitcoin.
The only thing that matters is profit..
Flippening cancelled.
It is now The Floppening.

Man I can't wait to gloat over retarded Bcash bagholders just like two weeks ago
Got in at yesterday at 0.16 and first of my sell orders triggered as I slept at 0.19.
Will see how far it dips and decide whether to keep the BTC I earned from it or buy back in.
Still got most of the BCH I bought yesterday so gonna set sell orders higher and watch this shit like a hawk rest of day.
The madman isn't kidding.
