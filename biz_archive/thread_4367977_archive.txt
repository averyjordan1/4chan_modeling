I was at $15k the beginning of this week.
Hit a high of $37k, now I'm at $25.
I feel like a failure...
feel like a humble brag more like it
I feel like a failureHow about you donate me some money
complaining about being up on your moneykys
How the fuck did you end up at $25?
I went from $20k to $70k back to $35k, do you see me making whiny threads about it?
Being Canadian, you're a failure regardless
