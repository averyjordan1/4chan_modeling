When you see a stagnant pattern like that is the time to... buy or sell?
Are those 1 day candles?If so then yes because looks like it found support and there is potential move to the upside.
swap
constant sideways action is the death of alts as BTC will keep rising
You do both and make money ya dip
Not teaching you how to take money from me.
min.Well, it's NEO, nothing to hide...Did it find its new floor at 0,0043?
hard to say from 30m charts lol.
If BTC moons tomorrow it will prolly go lower.
I think it is stable phase, coin has found a good support.
Normally you draw a "flag", if the price "out" of the flag , indicating up or down trend.
May need a zoom out chart to be sure tho.
30 mins chart may not enough.
Watch bollinger bands, if it's squeezed sell near next news, use parabolic SAR if ur swinging, godspeed.
If you're not sure on one timeframe, it helps to check others to see if the situation becomes clearer.
In this case NEO has obviously failed to breakout from this resistance line.. Dunno if would buy up here considering that.
