Nice LARP.
Setting orders well below the bid doesn’t result in you getting that order filled if someone fat fingers a trade.
Imagine I’m selling btc @ 8,000 and accidentally type 80.
Highest bid is 7,999.
The highest bid gets filled.
The only way to fill your 80 order is if I go to the book and select your specific order.
However you can exploit mistakes by setting sells higher than current price.
So instead of an 80 buy you set an 80,000 sell.
That could be filled on a fat finger.
Depends on the exchange
It's my first day here!
