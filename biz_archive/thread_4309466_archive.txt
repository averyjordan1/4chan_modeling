these last days i was mad about the BCH and i always hear about the "buy low sell high" so my question is: do anyone who has a good knowledge about crypto currencies could advise me about some new opportunities?
Buy the BTC dip anon, or ETH
Obviously the money is in ALTs, start paying attention to the anons who inform you about new coins appearing on EtherDelta and get in really early to 2x, 5x, 10x your initial investment.There is only pennies to be made investing in coins that have already mooned.example: https://etherdelta.com/#HST-ETH
