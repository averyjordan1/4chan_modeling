So 250 gwei for everything plus tip, right?
Literally, how are people so blinded by BTC's price?
It's a fucking store of value, wasn't meant to be used for exchange or as 'digital cash'.
I hope people realize there's more than money at stake here.
The wrong move can fuck you up big time just like the stock market crash in 2000.
>can you help with the transaction cost?
It's $8.00
store of value
While I'll agree that BTC's identity is now 'a store of value' it absolutely was meant to be cash.
The title of the original whitepaper is "Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system" So yeah I think that's pretty clear.
is it still a store of value if it stops going up
their answer to this is "buy the dip".

Have you read the whitepaper?
You are in denial.
i predicted the flippening at $600, but didn't buy any because long term I know it is shit.
so i bought back in at $1400 after the gold rush, then doubled down at $900 or so thinking Ver might have another pump up his sleeve.
Cashed out around $1300 when it was clear nothing was going to happen.median means you have to wait 8 hours or more
'real money'You mean some printed paper and molded metals?
