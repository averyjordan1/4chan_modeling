All of my friends are trying to find jobs and literally each of them have been asked that question in atleast one interview.
Does this make crypto a fad?
Or are we already at the normie stage now where people know there is serious money to be made and the 30x gains that we have all gotten accustomed to are less and less likely to happen with more regulation and more government control being introduced soon.how much further will we make it
It's a good interview question.
The guy you're replacing probably got fired for trading all day at work and/or quit once his potcoin mooned.
They probably just want to make sure they don't screw up and hire another "crypto gamer pothead".
getting asked if I trade>all my friendsWhat a faggot.
Here's a retard who obviously quit his job, thought he could make it in crypto, but then fell for the hodl meme on some shitcoin and is down 80% now trying to figure out how to pay for his ramen.
In what field of work are they asking this?
kek
This.
Just say you long term hold and haven't checked in a while.
Getting asked if i trade cryptocurrencies in job interviews nowShit that never happened - The thread
