I have to questions for you guys.
First question, does anyone have any opinion on Apple stock and how long will the continued success last.Second question, what collages and collage courses are good for working on Wall Street and maybe even being a stock broker.
>apple>collagethere's no hope, sorry
I wouldn’t invest in Apple.
They’re primarily interested in releasing the same phone over and over but more expensive each time.
And also in creating expensive computers that only a niche market is interested in.
This bubble can’t continue.
They have to innovate or they’ll be left behind.
