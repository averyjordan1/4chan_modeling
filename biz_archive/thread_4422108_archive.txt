Who else steadygains here even through the bitcoin dip?
Post 1 week charts
yeah i'm doing OK but only +10 for the week, you heavy on BCH anon?
not at all.
Ive been holding one since I first got it.
And I am currently daytrading with another 0.78 BCH that I bought at .1555 and .161.No im doing well mainly because I timed the last BTC dip well.
I was selling in the high 6s and low 7s and rebuying in low 6s and one of my orders was within 4 dollars of the very low of the dip.
I also did pretty ok selling some more bitcoin yesterday in the 7700 7800s.On top of that, ETH has spiked a bit, NEO has spiked a lot, and i was daytrading LTC yesterday during the pump for some quick gains.Everything is mooning rn except bitcoin.
Especially BCH.
Wish I bought more
