We'll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.
"How is that good?
They will turn Bitcoin into another investment fund which can only be traded by "licensed individuals".
It's no longer bitcoin.
It will become the risk free "grandpa" investment.

Goodluck "making it" with such a boring investment.

Good fucking luck.
Half the community are libertarian spurgs who would rather die than let bitcoin be regulated.
And for some not terrible reasons...
Bitcoin is for decentralized exchanges where no one controls the currency, what they want to do is rediculous.
