>Tfw almost all in BNT.. And bought pretty much all of it sub $2.Since most of you are retarded I should mention that BNT has an ETH reserve which means you get all the perks/stability of holding ETH, plus the chance of BNT going 10-30x (it's fucking #72 in mcap) in 2018.
If you're bullish on ETH there is literally no reason to hold ETH instead of BNT if you buy in now.
It's not going any lower in terms of ETH, since ICO money will start pouring in soon.You're welcome.
bancor.LOL
GOOD GOY
x is a pretty conservative number desu
Can't even blame OP if newfags fall for this.
This is where "lurk more" should apply.
