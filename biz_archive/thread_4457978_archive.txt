I guess I have a stupid question for you /biz/.
What makes the price of an alt-coin go up?
For example, with a stock, the price goes up under the possibility of increased cash flow.
Bitcoin is a different beast as it's a new transaction technology that currently isn't in commercial use.
I guess my question is how do you spot potential pump and dumps or know if a coin price is going to go up?
Usually it's new.
You have to be on top of everything if you're going to chase moons, twitter is a good tool for that.
Or /biz/, thing is people post a bunch of fake news on here to create FOMO.
News* my bad
Watch a video about "Tulip Madness" in the Netherlands in the 16th century for what is going on with Bitcoin.
With Alt-coins, "how to accurately spot a pump and dump" is the million dollar question, with tons of analysis on it and is a whole topic of its own.
The main thing the average investor should be concerned with is the quality of the whitepaper, the staff, and whether or not they have a working product, or plan to very soon.
