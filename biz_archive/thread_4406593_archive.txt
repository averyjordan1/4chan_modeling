i have literally made 0 money since i started in march this yearat first i was very bad, and i had no idea what i was doing, but now i learnt my listen and just hold coins for at first what i thought would be a week would be my max hold but i have been holding shit like lumen, komodo, lisk and ubiq for 2 months because i keep convincing my self it doesnt matter cause if you just keep holding it will go up eventually.pretty sure i even lost more than i put into crypto thanks to trading fees
Me too!
I actually think ubiq is a good very undervalued project and will moon again
You are what's called weak hands.
You're likely also buying in at the top and then sell when you're in the red.
Set up tight stop loss orders, but ones that make sense.
Look into general trading lessons.
Think about projects critically instead of getting shilled.
Plenty of the top 100 coins won't be around in a couple of years.
Companies use cryptos as kind of a way to get around getting listed on a stock exchange.Their coins serve no real purpose, which is generally a problem with crypto right now.
Plenty of interesting approaches, but very few require a token to be sold.This place is one of the worst if you're a beginner.
It's memes, fud, shilling, and toxicity galore.
Get off /biz/
Forgot.
If you're interested in learning about trading methods, look up Jason Jenkins.Hell, even Brandon Kelly's "boss method" is a legit approach if you can see past his shitty youtube persona spiel that he has going on.
I started last week and lost 40% of my money :)
get into BAT right now and don't let go.
we are going to the moon!if the type of thing I just said affects you in any way, you need to learn to control your emotions brahstudy technical analysis, thechartguys on youtube have a great tutorial series
