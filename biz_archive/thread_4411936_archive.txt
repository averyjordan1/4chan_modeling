How long did it take you to form your own opinion about crypto market, based on opinions of others?The whole thing is speculative, volatile, risky and consolidating all the time.
It has a lot of dumb retards in, that have no real experience with trading in real markets and that makes it kind of interesting I guess.How do you profit off these retards or do you do your own research about everything?
I don't want to be 10% that makes just a few bucks, I know there is 1% out there that is banking somehow.
Any tips in becoming a shark?
Daytrading seems to be quite alright, but what to hold right now is really something you have to look into.
