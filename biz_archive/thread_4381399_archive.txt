Literally missed out on so many moon missions because of this shite site.
Every time I load it I just get these goddamn buffer wheels.
Is this ED's fault or am I just fucking retarded?
Those buffer wheels should be replaced by market data at some point.
If not, try clearing cache, a different browser, etc.
ED is a slow unintuitive piece of shit
Try another browser.
Also since you say you're kinda special make sure to download your private key and put it inside some file with a password.
You sound like the kind of guy that clicks "forget account" by accident and loses everything.
No offense.
Instead of trying to use the drop down list to pick your coin, just go up into the URL and replace the ticker symbol with your coin and press enter.
If you still get wheels, press stop on the browser, and then press reload.
I've done this but it also hasn't work either.
Imma try to empty cache
No offense taken.
Appreciate the advice on the browser.
if I sell some token for eth on ED do I stll have to pay the gas price?
HAHAHHAHAHA this is why I love ED, it's literally retard proof
tfw had to use ED for the first time to buy Confido with my Nano S>tfw it was fucking easy and a lot better then Kraken>tfw you retards are too dumb to fill out some HTML text boxes
