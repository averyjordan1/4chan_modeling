Even a 9-year-old knows wacoin is going to moon once they set up ICO.
Why haven't you signed up yet anon?
because i never heard about it, safe?
why?
i already signed up - i think it has good chances because "safe" products in china are rare.. whats the next step after the registration in the whitelist?
waiting for the confirmation that you can buy the token?
Well my gf is from China.
She said these cases if fake products are usually supplied from poor shabby shops and are generally fringe / rare cases.That said, I am whitelisted and will probably put in.
I can see Rich Chinese parents wanting to protect their their baby buying off the wabi food isle.I like the team and that it has a working product ready to roll out.
On top of that the ico is being run very well.
The team is taking measures to prevent presale dump by buying back presale tokens at like 6x the price or locking them up for 6 months.Cap is also only 11.5m and Chinese are not allowed to participate.
