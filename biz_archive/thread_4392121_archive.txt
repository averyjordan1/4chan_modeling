Why do people advocate HODL on alts?
Its a shit strategy.
I should know, I held some alts through the recent 2 month long shit storm.
It just doesn't make sense - expecting to ever catch up with sat gains that happened when BTC was 1/3 - 1/2 of its current price.
Not to mention its ever moving forward.
There are people honestly expecting that OMG will be back to 0.003 sats?Cut your losses and make short term trades - don't get greedy or believe in these 'long term fundamentals' none of it counts for shit in a market with moving goal posts.
Get your profit - get OUT.Honestly the only advice worth listening to, I wish I had and I'd have close to 100% more BTC.
Only redditors say "hodl"... Gtfo
Wow, you have such great insights, truly wolf of crypto.
The problem is that you will be fucked beyond recognition in alt bull run and you won't be able to time it and will cry river about your unrealized gains, because you didn't "Hodl"
he didn't hodl AntsharesYou could have been rich f.am
hodl only works for BTCand yeah I lost substantial hodlings because I fell for the altcoin meme as well
Only BTC is worth holding, 98% of these altcoins will dissapear in the next 10 years
How would I get fucked during an alt bull run?
I never said don't invest in alts, I said don't sit in them.
If it was indeed a bull run, I can take getting into it 10-15% late than getting ruined by the constant onslaught of BTC.
we almost had a flippening last week, it can happen anytime dude, almost every alt out there has better tech than btc.
btcÂ´s problems and issues are becoming increasingly obvious.
the next forks will crash it.
Enjoy your BTC
you never ''hodl'' alts
muh bcash almost flipped btcIt's alright anon, get over it.
