STAKING THREAD day Traders and price action discussion not required show me what you're staking with show me what you're interested in I'm on beans and XBC I'm feeling pretty comfy I'm highly interested in deep onion but can't get the wallet to start and if I ever do I will buy some
Give the ark wallet an try.
Cleanest wallet in crypto.
Yeah staking is better than mining.
All these forks are a pain.
I am very interested in how PoS will develop in the next months.I know some people have already started making a Raspberry Pi compatible staking wallet, so you can stake 24/7 whilst barely using any electricity.
I know these guys are busy with it: https://twitter.com/WisprTech.
If you have any other coins that are doing the same please say so.Stratis RPI staking doesn't work, NAV doesn't work either.
DPoS Masterrace
Ark and Neblio only ones worth staking
Nebilo wallet looks like shit, ARK Wallet is underdeveloped and looks empty.
I has no jazz
Poloniex holds the Bitcoin Plus development wallet which sits at 14,000 shares and stakes 20% yearly until 2030 or so.
They aren't de-listing Bitcoin Plus anytime soon.
Bittrex and other exchanges will follow suit and add Bitcoin Plus probably next year.
When the $$$ make sense they all follow suit.Bitcoin Plus is following the same pattern and path that Bitcoin did early on.
1-2 years from now there will be people on here posting how they wish they would have bought this at $50 each...now it's $10,000 each.
There are now 10+ Digital Currencies with a billion dollar marketcap and I would gamble that Bitcoin Plus will be another billion dollar plus marketcap coin in 2 years.
You have massive amounts of development taking place in this coin that we would have only dreamed of a year ago like SegWit, major Dev, and a 100 more things.
And the developments are just getting startedBitcoin Plus is no joke.
This one is as real as it gets.
And the knuckleheads that come on here and post Scam Coin are as dumb as it gets.
Every coin has those people.
Bitcoin has had them forever.When Hedge Funds start eating Bitcoin Plus it will be a new adventure like we've never seen before.
And they are coming.
