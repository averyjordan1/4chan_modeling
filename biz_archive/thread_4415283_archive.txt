Is this shit ever going to recover ?
It's been almost 5 months of pure JUSTing, I'm down a lot even though I bought into it's ICO in july.
Should I just sell this fucking shit at a giant loss and start from scratch ?
Holy shit you're still holding that?lol I sold that shit at a 15% loss.
I ain't paying to run and maintain Waynes network.
Fuck that scam artist faggot, why did he need 25 million dollars for a broken ass network
I'm down x1,5 I'm hoping there would be a rebound to the ICO price at least so I could get rid of my bags.
Or what do you think ?
Maybe I should just cut my losses right fucking now and forget about this shitcoin as a bad dreamThis is the worst crypto investment I've ever made.
Learned my lesson well.
