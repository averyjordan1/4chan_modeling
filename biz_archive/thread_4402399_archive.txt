Sup capitalists niggas.
I want to start to mine bitcoins or whatever or at least start to understand how it works.
I'm completly new to this whole crypto thing.
Any advice on where to start?
how it works etc?
You're about 6 years too late on mining bitcoin unless you're willing to invest millions into it at this point and have access to cheap electricity.Some other shitcoin cryptos you could still mine and make at least some money from home.

I recommend picking up a book on finance and not touching crypto with a 1000 meter pole.
The idea behind crypto is horribly flawed.
It was intended to be a means of transaction, but it has totally failed at that.
Nobody transacts in these scams, everyone does it in actual currencies
yes I know but I have a big ass 1070 in my gaming rig, pretty much I'm out all day, living by myself and spend nothing on electricity bill
BCH bagholder
scamturned 300$ in 800$ within 2 weeks without leverages.
Feels good.
true, Just read an article from the Economist that basically said that the whole crypto market is based on the bet that there will be someone at some point buying your bitcoin based on the hype with real money while nobody almost cares about the actual revolution that can be done
Download NiceHash and keep it running while you're away.
It does everything for you.
Also I suggest googling what mining actually is, what bitcoin is, etcBitcoin.org is a good place to start
thanks anon, gotta check it out something else I should know about?
