prepare for a crash when the news comes out
sauce?
Bs.
They already hard fork 4 days ago.
Centralized Tether FTW.
muh TETHERHey NSA
Learn to write normally first.
Gonna call bullshit on this.They made that address unusable.
The hacker can't deposit it anywhere.
prepare for a crash when the news comes outWhy would it crash?
The market doesn't give a fuck about what new tethers are being used for, as long as they aren't stolen.
Is there some precedent you're referring to when you say there will be a crash, or are you talking out of your ass?
What happens if he sends it to another address which is using the old non-patched version then deposits it from there?
That's not possible.
Tether is centralized and the nodes are run by the company.
If they do a hardfork everyone will be on the new chain.
well that was a weak attempt to crash ethers price so u can jump in senpai
