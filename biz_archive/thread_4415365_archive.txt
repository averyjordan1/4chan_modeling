Listen up fags, i am holding heavy bags of these to shitcoins.
Sell at a loss or wait for the recovery?
i'm considering buying more honestly, coins like this and blackcoin are sleepersjust depends on how sleepy they want to be
I don't know man.
I really don'tsome of the best projects get the least money poored in.I wouldn't be surprised if these , or atleast 0x moon a big bunch in 2019.
ZRX is far from a shitcoin, the only reason anyone would be bagholding it is if they were dumb enough to buy it at $0.40 when it was 12x its ICO valuation...Be like me and have a large limit order at $0.19.
I'm up to 63,500 ZRX now
