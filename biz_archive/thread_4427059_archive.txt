Before january at least.
Before the coinbase BCH release and possible dump.One temporal point of opportunity is right after BTC difficulty adjusts next.
If they want to cause chain death.
If they do that, then BTC is over regardless of how many shekels jews try to throw at it to prop up the price.
It will take a few days at most and then it will drop like a rock once people become aware that they can't actually really transact anymore.
Ummmm never?
Youâ€™d have to be mentally retarded to dump BTC.
Not an argument!
