Stupid question but what is the best exchange to use for buying more obscure cryptos.
Bittrex?
Looked it up and reviews and clumsy interface scared me.
Pls halp
bittrex is the normalfag EX, you need to go deeper.
Pls biz
HODL BTC BITCH.
For obscure, recently released coins you go on Etherdelta.
Be careful though, there's a lot of people out there placing ridiculously low buy and insanely high sell orders in the hopes of someone fat-fingering their order and making them rich...
