To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand BITB.
The coin is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the chainlink most of the coin to be made will go over a typical crypto fag’s head.
There’s also the coins futuristic outlook, which is deftly woven into making bitcoin - its personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.
The buyers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it's not just an amazing going- this coin is as deep as life itself.
As a consequence people who dislike BITB truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Shilling's existential catchphrase “WERE OFF TO THE MOON” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as BITB's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens.
What fools.. how I pity them.
:joy:And yes, by the way, i DO have a BITB tattoo.
And no, you cannot see it.
It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
