BCH hard for to fix difficulty adjustment algo happensas to what happens after that, we'll find out
anon you know that forks are priced in right.
like bgold, bcash, s2x for bitcoin.
thats why it pumped (euphoria that no SHITTY 2x hardfork), then dumped (sell the news)Bcrash is going to dump even lower when hardfork is done.
% right Sir
sir>ANOTHER pajeet core shillhow many of you did they hire jesus christ
priced inyour 10 day btc transactions are not priced in
The difficulty algo changes the game theory of BCH vs BTC.
The same way BCH disrupted Bitcoin the last couple of days will now happen constantly but on lesser scale.
The question is how will core respond so they're not vulnerable.
Interesting times ahead.
This is the key thing, and consistent difficulty is better for mining so it'll be interesting to see where the hash power goes.
Miners will be incentives to stay on the BCH chain.
Since diff adjust every block if it becomes less profitable than BTC and the miner jumps over to BTC, BCH chain will start to adjust the diff the next block.
Mining reward will also rise as the number of fee paying transaction will fill up and the miner can claim up to 8mb of those transactions.
On the BTC chain if it becomes unprofitable the miner jumps over to BCH, BTC won't react up to 2016 blocks to reduce diff and since 1mb are already full the only way to incentives miners back onto the BTC chain is to increase transaction fees and the last couple of days has shown how this effects Bitcoin.
And to think all of this could've been avoided if core just increased the block size.
I've been wondering about this for days, thanks for the explanation
