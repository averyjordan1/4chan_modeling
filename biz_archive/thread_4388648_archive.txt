What's the deal with HShare?
Why is nobody talking about this?
Decred repo copy-pasted there's nothing to talk about
care to comment on the recent pump?
WTF happened?
because it's a shit tier, that could be a scam.
They do crazy marketing on their facebook and stuff , ppl spining signs about hcash, but have no outreach of anything, their slack non responsive when I was in it, no youtubes no youtubers talking about it.
plus it does not do a damn thing, its basically a cash grab
Fuarkk
I can see a x2 in the near future.
And there is nothing wrong with a cash grab.
I bought at $18 looks like its been good so far.
