Who here getting pajeet'd right now?
Justed by NEO BCASH and ETH consecutively
I'm a little bit Jihan'd but still in profit
Finally made a blockfolio today after a month and "just" realised I have lost 400 out of my 2100 I have invested already.
All on neo btc strat fees and link.
I am not worried about the link have 10000 and I am not trading so much anymore I have a select few and not sticking to it.
Not going to day trade till I get my money back.
$2100 with 10k LINK means you only have ~$400 in other coins.wtf?
Fullfuxkin retard I know I'm shooting the moon on that one.
I known it will make a profit one day.
And I am putting money back into eth btc now and that is my moon coin ininvest about 600 every two weeks into big names.
I moved to link because I actually thinknit will be my big shot.
