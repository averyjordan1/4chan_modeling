Can you guys please help a newfag brainlet understand how to calculate the liquidation point of a margin.
If i open a trade with $100 or $1000 using a x5 or x10 leverage, how much would btc need rise/fall before liquidation.
I feel a short coming on if and when btc hits 7600-7900
its not going to hit 7600
Still a week till the fork.
Never, ever short BTC, because of short squeezing.
Only go long.
Someone claimed they opened a long position on BTC since 5900 something and went to 7000 somethig.
He must be rich now.
Maybe you can find the thread in archive, it was a few days ago.
Would they really bother to short squeeze such a small amount of capital though?
100-500 with a 5x margin doesn't seem worth it.
You may be right though, I remember when bcc came out there was a historic amount of shorts and they all got btfo
I wish i went long on bitcoin last night at 6900 but I was extremely tired and needed sleep.
There was also the chance it could of sank down to 6500 levels but seemed fairly unlikely, going long now would be dumb though, so it's either short, or do nothing and wait for a long position opportunity again
