How do I lower my fees?
I deposited some small money yesterday and was a little bit disgusted, when Coinbase took my money off for buying BTC, then I payed 8$ fee (wtf) for transfering that to paper wallet.
Then I deposit from paper wallet onto blockchain.info wallet, where I again payed fee for sending it to Bittrex.I know I could send BTCs from Coinbase to Bittrex, but I was just messing around to see how everything works and what fees are like.
This is pretty obviously a fake story to FUD BTC, but yes, prices on BTC transactions are indeed retarded.
then I payed 8$ fee (wtf) for transfering that to paper wallet.BTC is too expensive to be a medium of exchange.
Tx fees and times are a joke.Buy ETH.
If you want to actually hold BTC for some reason buy ETH, send it to an exchange ($.10) then trade it for BTC.
