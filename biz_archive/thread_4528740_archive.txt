Yes, it's another decentralized exchange, BUT IT'S CURRENTLY THE BEST FUCKING ONE AND NONE OF YOU RETARDS EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.> ATOMIC FUCKING SWAPS.
You know those things everyone's been hyping up recently when guys like altcoin.io do them.
Well guess fucking what, blocknets being doing them for YEARS, you can do them on the DEX RIGHT FUCKING NOW https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDBoR9fHb21bLH7FGvFrQg/videos 35 different coins working atm> IT'S ACTUALLY FUCKING DECENTRALIZED.
No bullshit IOUs, no off chain order books etc etc.
Everything is done on the blockchain AND IT'S FAST AS FUCK.
It is literally going to be the first FULLY decentralized exchange to launch.
This is important because it means NOTHING can stop the blocknet.>ETHFINEX PARTNERSHIPTHAT'S RIGHT NIGGERS, IT'S MEANS YOUR GOING TO SEE THE ENTIRE ETHFINEX ORDERBOOK ON THE BLOCKNET AND VICE-VERSA.>IT'S SUPER FUCKING PROFITABLEAll of the trading fees go directly to nodes and stakers.
You can see ROI here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y8uRsftL_uUcDPPiRvDDxJwI2ftLZq1iPavKaGfrF_c/edit#gid=0 .Imagine if blocknet was just 2% of daily volume.
For just $30k worth of block you would get 100k a year from staking.
Pretty dope right?Once SPV wallets come out(no need to download full blockchain) and UI gets released blocknet will do a fucking ANS, mark my words.
It's super under the radar at the moment (fifth lowest volume in the top 100 holy shit)
LOOK AT HOW SEXY THE UI IS https://medium.com/@theblocknetchannel/blocknet-decentralized-exchange-high-quality-images-a68d8fbd2b81READ THIS IF YOUR A BRAINLET WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY 2018 IS GOING TO BE THE YEAR OF THE DEXhttps://medium.com/@theblocknetchannel/the-trouble-with-centralized-exchanges-639273f54fd4
whats the website
It's actually decentralized.The Internet is a centralized product owned by centralized, even private, companies and centralized governments.
If I need the Internet to interact with Blocknet IN ANY WAY, then it's not decentralized.Fuck off lying kike.
what is a mesh net?
I guess we need to create our own internet then right?
>Tfw can't afford a node;_;
Brb just asking my dad for a small loan of 30k
Don't you need $100k to get a node?
it's 5000 BLOCK for one
Botnet
Sadly yes, currently the node costs upwards of $100k.
If I only bought 5k of them while it was dirt cheap...
Either way, when equilibrium is reached stalkers should earn the same proportionally as node owners
I wanted a MN but prefer SYS 60% ROI and zCOIN 30% ROIIâ€™d buy one for sure but damn the cost is too highMake them cut it in half
ok OP, convince me why right now is a good time to buy this and I will.
I just have no idea about coming announcements etc to judge if this is a proper entry point.
Read what I just said here Don't forget, coins with crazy high inflation doesn't translate to ROI as in theory price should decrease in line with inflation.
With blocknet there is a real use case and you will be collecting feesDYOR, they posted a roadmap on the medium account I linked
Yeah, I have been slowly buying up full node.I have 1 but want to get another.This is the only decentralised exchange already working with atomic swaps.Every full node will earn you around 8k a month in trading fees and block reward.
Its just a no brainier.The new interface looks awsome and the Dev's spend no time shilling and all time committing code.
