/11>still hodling btcwhat the fuck should i do /biz/, this is pathetic
sell low buy high
put at least half your shit into bch, the flippening process has already started
I'm in the same.
I saw the dip with BCH last night that lined up with the dead cat bounce of BTC before I went to bed and actually went back into BTC proud of my 40% gains, now I'm back to square 1 with BTC dropping below 6300 equaling out my gains from yesterday because i boughtt that it was really an asian PnD.Now not sure to just keep it in ETH where it is safe to only lose 7%~ during this or just FOMO my shit up into BCH.Is this really the flippening?
