When is it gonna pop /biz/?
And how much will you lose?
Hasnt gone mainstream enough for a bubble m8.Wait till the marketcap starts getting into the trillions
You'll have a lot of people at the table on Thanksgiving talking about Bitcoin.That's when it will begin.When the boomer goes "Well my friend said it was Tulip Mania!
", that's when a kid 20 years younger than said boomer will blurt out "Well my Blockfolio says I'm up 10% since you started talking."
Everyone at the table will be like "WTF".But to be serious, don't tell family you have BTC or crypto.
They'll milk you for information and try to borrow money.
Just don't.
It's gaining a little mainstream recognition but institutional money and the large majority of the investing public are still terrified of it and calling a bubble every day.That means it's still a good time to get in, once the real mainstream fomo hits it will get wild
every mainstream cuck is calling outrageous targets.they have no idea what is about to happenthis is going to be epic
Mainstream fomo seems like a paradox.
Its still just a bubble if most of its value is from people speculating
It's only a bubble if people buying in don't think it has value.
Most of us do.
Once upon a time gold was just a shiny metal that was useless as a tool or weapon.
I'd say the crash will be end of 2018 or sometime mid 2019.
It depends, if a coin ends up proving as THE decentralised currency it may be adopted permanently.
Until bitcoin's fees are sorted and the volatility doesn't change with a few percent daily then it's not going to be used as currency any time soon.
People think its value is investing and making a bunch of money.
How much of its value is based on its actual intended use
