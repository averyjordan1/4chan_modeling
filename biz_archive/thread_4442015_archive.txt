I'm only up 4000% while every crypto fagget here think eth holders are all bagholding.
Looks like the new wave is in since few months, it has churned and now poised for new high.
Thanks i feel even comfier.
goodnight sweet prince
sold 2 btc for 80 eth in january.
invested 80 eth into dice etheroll ico.
for ~16k dice.
after dice unlocked eth was at ~400ish each.
and that 16k dice was worth 160 eth worth 64k.
initial 2k (1k per btc in january) investment.
at that point traded some dice and made super gains manipulating the dice price.
accumulated 42k dice.
held till dice went to about .03 each.
slowly sold dice from .01-.03. ended up with many many ether hundreds of ether, and also still thousands of dice.
didnt know what to do with all the ether, started to invest in icos, icos started to be easy 2x+ flips.
flipped the hundreds of ether into double easily overnight with ico flips.
now sitting comfy af with thousands of ether, plenty btc, tokens from icos out the ass.
literally buying everything anytime i go out.
comfy as fuck due to ethereum network and its dapps.
and everyone still talking about ethereum is just getting started and is about to be super huge next year.
well well fuck fuck, im tryna get more eth but like wtf?
icos are getting sucked dry, most end up under ico price.
alts in general arent doing the best.
btc and eth is all im looking at.
i got soo many tokens i duno even what to do with them.
i can literally crash dump alot of the bigger icos and definitely alot of the smaller ones too.
get the fuck in eth if u missed the btc train 4 years ago.
eth is gonnna be .1 btc per eth again.
Not bad for 2k.
Fucking well played anon
