Can anybody explain what the fuck this guy is doing?
Why is he trading his coins back and forth?
The costs of 0.1% fee on every transaction must surely outweight any possible gains from market manipulation with a low-volume shitcoin like this.He always undercuts any sell order I put in, no matter how tiny.Is it a dumb bot?
It is some chink or faggot here's bot.Yeah it is annoying, just keep flashing buy / sell orders lower and lower until his stack gets scalped.
Binance runs bots.
This isn't news.
The costs of 0.1% fee on every transaction must surely outweight any possible gainsyou do realise this is binance bot right?
everybody knows it but nobody talks about it
4491432I do now.
It's news to me, though hardly a surprise.
Is it even a bad thing?
I'm not trying to shill, but I can't think of any downsides.
4491432Not much of a trader, how common is this for an exchange?
I avoid Binance like the plague because of their fraudbots and I'm not even a day trader.
Everyone associated with that exchange should be raped to death in prison
It's illegal in civilized countries
im new to crypto, and only have a binance acc what exchange would u recommend instead?
Extremely.Algorithmic high-frequency trading frontruns and undercuts the majority of stock market trading, every hour of every day.
They accomplish this with special orders, that allow their trades to seemingly jump to the front of the queue, or cancel to escape a bad trade, when correctly calibrated.It's a multibillion dollar middleman industry, siphoning off from legitimate investors with the aid of high speed technology and deals with the exchanges themselves.And now that I've said it, this thread will be saged, as is every thread I mention HFT in.
