What are you niggas buying?The BTC dip?The POWER dip?Is BCH gonna pump, what about ETH?
Yes
POWR and ETH, both going too sky rockets before December.
ETH $700 before the end of this month.
Too late for quantstamp.
Too late for stratis.
Too late... Should i wait for dips or look into other projects?
Komodo looks like a good buy but idk.
Shill me biz.
I can put 1000.00 into something tonight.
Buy til December for kmd
Everything I have is mooning ATM and will continue throughout Dec-Jan. You wont get any good answers ITT except this : DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
Find coins with big news coming up in a few months, and wait for a big BTC pump so all alts bleed, then go shopping for said alts.
You will not make any good money chasing pumps like a retard.
This board is just pajeets telling you to buy high.
Wanting to get some POWR when it dips lower but the motherfucker won't decide which way it wants to go.
Now's a good time IMO.
incredible
post the original pic please, i used to jerk off to it so much
imhopowrit has huge potential.
once we have confirmation on some of the partnerships they are in talks with this will spike.
Ben shapiros sister is such a dirty little kike whore
its paired with btc tho, btc price down = powr price down ?
even if it goes back up to 10k sats
how do I grow tits like that
