>Step 1: Get a cute dog>Step 2: Dress like a homeless person>Step 3: Find good spots to beg where they don't kick you out I spotted a guy from uni who was begging so I asked him wtf he was doing, because he wasn't homeless and was in my class.
He told me he sometimes makes like 300 euros or more A NIGHT.
It dropped my jaw You probably feel like shit at first.
But holy shit brehs.
what does he do all day?
just sit there and think about how much of a piece of shit he is?
petting his dog.
did it feel like a "joker caught in the act" moment?
I think he was a bit ashamed desu
I actually used to panhandle, homeless on the streets.
Averaged between $5 and $15 a day.
It took six months to save two hundred bucks.Fuck off, larp.
There's no money and no self respect in that life.
share your story maybe?
sounds interesting.
