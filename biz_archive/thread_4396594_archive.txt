Sell at 55% up, figure it's about to dump, come back 30 mins later pic relatedfuck me up man
what you complaining about?
You've made 1.5x your investment I would call that solid
Greed is bad my dude.
Always take the profit.
You made a good move.
Most people hold until they lose everything.
Most shitcoins follow the pattern of pump and dump, so it's better to sell fast.
You're right, just sucks when you see what could've been.
I'm still happy to have profit at all though
55% up is great, you did the right thing
i made this mistake with bch but guess what, greed got to me and i bought in again at .41 and it dumped on me to .24. still walked away with $500 clean profit.
still feels good man.
lock in clean and walk tf away
Yea, I sold 10,000 VTC at $1
OP just dont buy back innever do thatwalk away from this shitcoin
Good cut, know your limits.
Also: Dont ever buy shitcoins again
