Isn't that an African country?
North African to be exact
yup
who gives a fuck about those schapenneukers
Im half sand monkey morracan, and morrocco is the biggest shitcoin of them all
All the tyran governments are banning it.
Fine, let them stay poor.
good, let's make bitcoin the white ethnostate coin by banning bitcoin for all subhumans
Kek, yeah that'll stop it
Will they be raiding all USB drives in the country?
USB coup?
WTF?Sandniggers won't make it.
Many more "For Africa" concerts will be made.Oh well...feels good to be White.
Also, if Morocco is banning it, that's another reason why you should buy it lmao.
Good, now everyone trying to preserve their savings will buy BTC in Morocco too.
It's already happening in crisis ridden countries like Venezuela or Zimbabwe.It's a good trend for the future of BTC.
Sooner or later, much bigger countries with volatile economies will suffer from a crisis (Brazil comes to mind).
Imagine millions of Brazilians willing to pay anything for a BTC, just to be able to park their savings somewhere safe.
Coming soon to the USA, after Wall St. extracts your life savings first, of course
source pls?
Maroccans are cancer stupid anyway, they'd probably be losing all of their country's money which will then be followed posting brown wojaks all day.
Well spoken
Was thinking of going to Morocco somewhere in December/January.
Thoughts?
