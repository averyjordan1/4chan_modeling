I told /biz yesterday about it and said we will be in the range of 0.40cents... no one gave a fuck.Probably on friday the app will be available and we will se a price of more than 1$.Current MC is about 17.500.000 and a supply of 45.000.000 coins.Thats a perfect shortterm trade.
entry point is good at around 0.000058-0.000063
and again noone cares, haha miss out :D
>pls buy my coin!If it is so good, why is nobody here talking about it?
They never listen
I posted yesterday about Blockmason.One effing reply.Stay poor biz
Biz just cant let go of their req/link bags
/biz is busy talking about coins that already mooned
This right here is the cold hard truth.
Can't let go of the worn out bags.
