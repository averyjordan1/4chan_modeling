Why is it the coins /biz/ always shill crash and the coins /biz/ ignores always moon?
Uh which category does Lisk fall into?
Because there's poetic justice - anyone listening to /biz/'s shilling gets REQt.
moon category>captcha>CUM
i look at /biz for a good idea of what coins to avoid since the one people are shilling are usually near their peak prices
I have a bunch of Lisk but where is the moon coming from?
They're not announcing anything big on 22nd
i thought further classification on dates for sdk and rebranding is on 22nd?
This was shilled last year a lot.
Then it kept falling, falling.
Finally it recovered.
I wonder what the bottom for LINK will be?
