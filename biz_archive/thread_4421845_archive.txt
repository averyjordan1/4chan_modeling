>btc tried and failed to break 8k several times nowthe normies are LAUGHING at us
will be 8500 on monday
oh gee, more tether to prevent bch from breaking 1500?
Bitcoin always fails to break its next target price and remain above it until after it corrects.
Plus, BTC just got a ton of good press and we all know in cryptoworld that good news about a coin makes it dump.
Remember the good news about ETH a couple weeks ago when it dropped below $290 for the first time in a long time, then the conferences for LINK, XRP, XLM, etc.History repeats.
It wont be long before BTC comes back and touches 10k.
BTC was barely hitting 7000 USD a few weeks ago as well, and just in January this year it was $1000.No one here on /biz/ has patience, and thats why you all lose money.
Thank macro, not micro.
If you want to make money on BTC while it does its normal fluctuations, then short it on an options exchange or buy the dip.
i am used to the laughter of normies
buy nuls
Nah man, let them all switch back to BCH, they need to learn the hard way
This is a good thing long term.
You want the price to stabilize around 7-8k for a while before it breaks out.
Too much growth without retesting support is unstable.
but BTC is the ultimate normie coin
weaklings see failurewinners see opportunitiest.
thanks for buying my bags nice and high
Going for another attempt after sellers failed to extend a technical break.
Better not this time.
Better not fail*
We were at $3,500 two months ago.
DOUBLE THE VALUE IN TWO MONTHS.
The only people laughing are BTC holders.
it was like ~$4000-4500 a month ago, think about that.
You impatient cunts are pathetic
