20%?
depends, usually not less than 30%
min 100%
it obviously depends on the intervals in which you trade, which depends on how much time you spend in front of graphs each day
around 10%I'm making money on something I know will be worthless in 3 years, so I'm not going to get too greedy
I go into every trade expecting a 2x.
I usually trade out after 10-30% and look to buy in lower.
I fell for the day trade half your stack meme and make 10% each trade is that a good number?

I'm critiquing your reddit vocabulary not your trading strategy, brainlet.
don't look for percentages, look for trends.for example, singles day a while back.if you thought it'd go down, sell before hand, buy back at the end of the day, accept your percentage gain in the middle.I've had limits not get triggered because market price came within .5% of the goal, but not quite.

Watch her latest video.
Chubby.
I follow her on Instagram and she seems mostly the same
I only trade the 4H chart and I normally shoot for a 30% gain at the bare minimum
at least 300% or else why bother
2% a time minus bitrex fee - 3 or 4 times a day
I've thought about doing this.
How easy is it to get the 2%?
Longest you've got to wait?
Any stop-loss?
i trade oversold dumps - if i buy on the start of the upswing i rarely wait more than a few minutesat the moment im holding out for 3% on eth, been waiting a few hours, it just needs to get above 24hour high and ill be set for todayabout 77% success rate.no stop loss.
i just manual cancel and only leave it in btc or eth at the end of the day
Thanks for this dude, appreciate it!You use any indicators, RSI etc?

Depends on the setup, if the chart looks promising for a big jump, I expect 10-20%, sometimes I do small swing trades with 1-2%My problem is that I exit too early usually, could have rode some really big moons if my hands were stronger.
I view it as "every profit is good profit" though, I am up 3x my portfolio since last month, and almost everything on trades with the percentages I posted
no - just intuition.
