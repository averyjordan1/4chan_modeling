Too complex, even for the crypto nerds
I like it when /biz/ ISN'T talking about my fucking winners okay.
I'm glad biz idiots don't fucking see the value yet.
They ruin everything.
They invest in the coins these guys are partnered with but are oblivious.
They don't deserve this fucking opportunity.
People have their attention other places.I think it's safe in this thread.
It's never safe.
A whale or two could fuck this whole thing up.
>down 68% in the last 3 monthsI'm not sure why you think at the moment it's so great?
Although at 9 cents it's hard to go wrong, sink 100$ of spare change and you might have a winner?Why are whales so hated?
Isn't buying coins a good thing?
There's a lot of news coming, and a listing on Bittrex just as soon as the security audit is finished.It's way under ico price, and almost universally agreed that Binance being the only market is largely what's holding it back./biz/ uses binance, so there's a first mover advantage.
I was just largely surprised to have seen relatively no talking about it.
This is a good post, you used plenty of vocab thrown around here that I don't quite graspWhat is an ico?Why does /biz/ use binance?
I use bittrex because I can understand the layout.
Binance app is ridiculously cluttered and hard to use What news Is coming ?
What is this project about?
everyones making too much money in POWR right now, so
Initial Coin Offering.Binance has been faster at having good coins lately.
POWR was listed on binance first.
