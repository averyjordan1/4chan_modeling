bitfinex made it to the new york times.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/technology/bitcoin-bitfinex-tether.html?_r=0
In the latest blow, on Tuesday, an alternative virtual currency that is owned and operated by the same people as Bitfinex, known as Tether, announced that it had been hacked and lost around $30 million worth of digital tokens.None of that has been enough to stop customers from pumping billions of dollars worth of virtual currency trades through Bitfinex in recent weeks â€” on some days, the exchange claimed to be doing more trades, by dollar value, than some stock exchanges in the United States.

But at least one customer, Coinbase, got a better deal after threatening to sue, multiple sources told me.
Congrats on this.
Seriously.
Why does mainstream media hate crypto?
Rich always protected from losses.
Why are they questioning a sketchy exchange>Stop that please>I don't want to lose money>PLEASE STOP LOOKING INTO FUCKING GOD DAMN YOU CUNTS
now I understand why bitfinexed goes to that extent to keep himself anonymous (voice changer, proxies).
I wouldn't be surprised if Tether/Bitfinex tried to threaten his life to make him stop talking about this shady shit.
Fuck Bitfinex, fuck Tether and fuck the shills.
because media and finance are both owned by the same jews.
Crypto is the way that the unwashed goyim get out from under them.
They did not anticipate crypto, and they fear it.
Bitfinex already know his identity He only begged them from a refund on the btc he sold at 1k.. they have all his details He's a dirty ass kike by the way Its easy to find out who he is Dig deep
So the exchange released his private details to the public as well?
Damn, if true, this proves that Bitfinex is a very untrustworthy exchange.
If proven that it is involved with this Tether printing BS, I hope it gets shut down.
