yo wtf i looked this shit up and its pretty legit.
i played some of the demo games on the site, i think it has potential.
its at 2 cents rn but the only thing im not understanding is that isnt the price supposed to be low af since people are using them for the games?
like theres no way these can reach $10 a token because it would render the game way to expensive right?
The price of the token is irrelevant when you can bet a millionth of a token...
$10 is unlikely.
But $0.50-1.00 is entirely possible.
They are looking to take on a big portion of the online gambling market, which has a $42B a year revenue.
If they even take 10% of that, FUN holders are going to the moon.
M-moon mission soon you guysseriouslyplease by my bags...
It just pumped slightly above floor.
