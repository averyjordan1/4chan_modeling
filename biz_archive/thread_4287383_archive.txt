That feel when you're all-in on alts so you don't have to gamble which Buttcoin will be the winner... we just have to lay low and hold for a week or two.
we alties are no longer salty
>he doesnt hold equal amounts of BTC and BCH
enjoy the weekend dump
uh...anonyou know alts are priced in btc, not bch right
The problem is you lost more than if you were holding BTC.
Alts are down ~10-25% and BTC is down 8%
I don't have any faith in alts anymore.
They are Bitcoin's bitch and holding them is idiotic.
Yeah fuck it.Bitcoin has pissed me off with these fork hoaxes, I think I'm gonna go all in on REQ.
Nice 7% dip right now, so almost instant gains.
But when alts moon they moon hard, 2x in a day has been done many times on several different shit coins.
you wont get that kind of return from bitcoin anymore
So what are your general tactics when playing with alts?
up 40-50% the day fork was cancelled>down 10-20% todayyeah, he definitely lost money not holding bitcoinKEK
Comfy as fuck on the Ark
Bitcoin has dominated the limelight these past couple of months only because of all this hardfork bullshit.
This hardfork drama is at its peak though, now is really the last time stock up on your favorite alts before this BTC/BCC shitshow ends and alts come back into play in a big way.
This.Let the stupid chinks under BCC and the greedy kikes under BTC duke it out over their petty miner fees, while the aryan man under Alts waits to reclaim his rightful place on the profit hierarchy.
Comfy with my XTZ, LINK, MTH
OP knows where it's at
