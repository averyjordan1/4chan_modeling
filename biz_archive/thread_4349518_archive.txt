Simple, my fine friend.
All you have to do to pump any altcoin is say its going to be in the next PBC letter and fake a PDF screenshots and people will mindlessly in droves buy it.
Although this one could be legit seeing as Teeka's cousin is behind this coin.However doesn't that seem shady since they're family?
;^)
Is there proof that is his cousin?
Tiwari is not that unusual of a last name for people from India.
Also the Tiwari associated with this coin is a marketing person.
He is not really "behind" this coin.

I looked it up and Tiwari is a very common surname of the Hindu Brahmans.Very misleading for people to be saying this is Teeka's cousin.
