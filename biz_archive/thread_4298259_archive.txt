XLM will moon in the next 2 hours.
Mark my words
No shit, even the most basic TA shows this.
No shilling required.Will pull back at 570-575 before a run towards 750.
SOURCE?OURCE?
sauce faggot
Bought in at 382 - comfy as while BTC/BCC shills battle it out
4298278Look at the fucking chart
I think it'll increase by 100 sat before it starts stagnating again.
My portfolio is 50% XLM, strapped in
Volume seems to be droppingI don't think it's going to happen
Lmao fucking dumb.
I'm in on Xlm but I'm realistic.
It's barely going above 600 if even that.
It's a simple swing trade
just bought.
hoping for a nice little tidy profit.
