Did the same, but didn't FOMO shit and now I get to watch my BTC hit a new ATH
unloaded my airdropped BCH in August for 0.17.
It was a scamcoin then and remains a scamcoin now.
True, I could have eeked out a bit more profit if I had waited, but whatever the case it's headed to zero eventually.
buy request at 700 sats sell at 800, its now at 900 JUST
if u girl i be happy to give you big hugs and creampie to comfort you yes
buy powr at 2300-2400 sats sell at 2662, its now at 2700 sats JUST
buy ubq at 18.3k sell at 19k, its now 18.6k.
At least I didn't get JUSTED on this one
$300 down because I bought BCH at ATH 2 days ago.
I don't think there's a way out of this.
Back on track.
