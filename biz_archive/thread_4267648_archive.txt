Partnered with GOLEM?
You mean the ULTIMATE bagholder coin?
I can't wait til all these nerds just leave behind the nerd coins.
Get on board with some real coins like LINK, REQ, AST, MOD,OMG, DOVU.
Just to throw you a bone....
Link, Dovu and maybe Modum are the only decent coins in your list other than OMG which they have the advisors of on their team.
OMG has no product, seeing as they have almost a billion dollar market cap with no product, imagine what they can accomplish with something like this where there is already a prototype on day one.
