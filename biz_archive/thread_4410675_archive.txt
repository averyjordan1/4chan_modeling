Suddenly his fashion sense is not funny anymore
are child chains what he uses to trap children in his dungeon
I agree his clothes are really fucking creepy now and just to attract children.
The cute unicorn eth logo isn't cute anymore either
Finally a use for ChainLink!
Aren't the most powerful wealthy men pedos?Why aren't you investing in eth right now?
im missing a point that he is trying to prove or what is going on with vitalik lately?
JCP.
A CP library for Java.
Its suppressing because I would think kiddy fiddlers are more of a Python crowd.
Well his stance on CP is Ok to have for personal use.
Of course he forgets that in order to HODL your CP , somebody has to find enough C for the P to happen which is not ideal for C.
