https://btcbitz.comFriend said he invested about 200$ around 3 months back, got around 1.5k now.
Relatively new to the whole crypto game as well, someone shed some light please?
Invested in the site, what does that mean?
What does the site do?Also did you friend also give you a referral link to join under him?
750% scam
Damn, forgot to mention the referral part.
Yeah, he low-key mentioned it during the talk.He didn't go into the full details at the time, said he'd give me a full rundown this Monday.
Just told me about the site and said that it's like using BTC as a kind of investment to get a daily return of 1% from the total amount you put in for 300 days.
Checked up on the site and it looked shady af so here I am.
Sounds like a scam, you guys would probably like bitconnect, its a similar scam (1%/day) but has nice memes and better websites.
Look up bitpetite.
They just recently exit scammed people for thousands and were not up for long.
