Etherparty unleashes the speed, cost-reduction and security benefits of smart contracts for individuals and businesses.
It represents the next generation of software as a service.
Etherparty promises to do for smart contracts what content management systems, like Wordpress and Wix, did for web development.FUEL is a transferable ERC-20 compliant digital token deployed on the Ethereum network, and is the in-app currency that powers the Etherparty platform.
The FUEL token serves as a method of validating the userâ€™s interactions with Etherparty and will allow users to buy, execute, or barter for other smart contracts in the platform.
In the future, FUEL will serve as access for smart contracts on multiple blockchains, integrating these disparate blockchains into one unified view within the Etherparty platform.
These guys do similar stuff to BlockCAT but have an actual legit team focusing on enterprise.
Get it while it's cheap.
Just went all in at 800 sats.
This one is hitting 2000 sats within 72 hours.
If I've learned anything in the last few weeks, ALWAYS buy atleast a small bag of something JUST listed on Binance.
It's only going to go up.Easily a 2000 sat coin.
Another great investing opportunity.
Thanks OP!
hey shills, how ya doing
>+74% last 24hWAY too latePaying 75 cents for the bags of someone who paid 25 cents just 2 days ago is retarded, binance or no
imagine what is gonna happen when BLOCKCAT is listed next month
