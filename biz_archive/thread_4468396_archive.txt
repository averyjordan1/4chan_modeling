anyone remember this shit?
kek
Yep, airdropped trash in August I think.Lol wonder what retards actually gave ETH in ICO.Website still up.Anonymous team so you deserve what you get if you invested.
Yeah I was a paid shill for them.
The devs went silent after the ico started.
They only got like 10 eth lol.
Seemed like an interesting project but obviously was a scam.
They probably spent like 2-3 eth in expenses for the site and graphic designers so no idea how their scam was planned kek
