Some group of fat hair stinky pajeets promised me that Astro would hit $15.
Once I bought it then all the shilling threads stopped.
I noticed it was odd but I read the whitepaper and the coin looked promising so I didnt think much of it.Fast forward today I look at the price and its at 0.004.
I bought at 0.009WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO????????
