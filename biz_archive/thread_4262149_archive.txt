my monero thread got deleted :(
It did dip last in the last week or two when btc ran up.
XMR will never be below $100 again
The only reason Monero is not  dollars right now is because it got hit right in the nuts by the China FUD.
It was at $150 and rising with solid momentum in September.
The only way Monero dips sub $100 is if the entire market crashes again, which unfortunately could happen.
Keep some USDT aside for that scenario, it's your only possibility of buying low.
I sold monero 3 days ago and i was honestly thinking about posting my first pink wojack.I bought back in.
High.
Wtf is wrong with me, impatience and greed is such a strong motor.
