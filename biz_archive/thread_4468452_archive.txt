There is vert little Chancoin left to buy on Cryptopia and we have reached a stable +140 normal people online on the Chancoin Discord!
The future is bright and secure for Chancoiners.

REPS AND KEGS BABY.
DON'T EVEN NEED A TOWEL COINBOIZ.
If you need people on 4chan to pump a coin to make it worth something, you probably should make a better coin.
Watch it!
one day
I want to trade my BCH for this coin.
What is the best way to do that with minimal fees?
Cryptopia trades both but you are probably better off exchanging for litecoin/eth first.
Thank you.
What is the reason for the intermediate trade?
Seems counterintuitive to add work for the exchange to do
I'm also interested in mining.
Is there a place I can look at the difficulty/hashrate?
It is difficult to find much of anything on 4CH at this point but I figure that is because it's relatively early in its lifecycle
Bitcoin (and bch) have ridiculous transaction fees and take forever, unlike eth/litecoin.
The fee from the exchange will be less than the tx.
I just figured out how to mine last night but the network is down atm otherwise I'd show ya
KEEP THEM REPS UP KEG CHAMPS WE RIDIN'.............TAKE A TOWL.

You could have gotten extra coin for dem trips.
Add Chancoin wallet address in your "name" field.
the only coin we tip with here is niggers not your gay shit
When will NGRs go to the moon?
how much is trips?
i know dubs are 2 coins
Kek
Get back the Discord bot which notifies when someone has claimed 2 Chancoins, the better version of it.
It stimulates pump activity here.
Without ir the /viz/ general is low performance.
