Because it wont ever go up to 20 cents?
Please die chainlink shill.
Thanks.
Because I bought at 40c
it hits 20 cents every other day you fucking retard
could make your money back
It's amazing how people got on board the LINK train at .40 or higher.
It was only at that point for a brief moment in its overall lifespan.
I sold at 18-19 cents and made some comfy gains when it hit 2000 sats.
FeelsGoodMan.
If it goes below 15 I'll buy

LINK will take forever to moon.
Too many bagholders that will sell when the price goes up.
People on 4chan change their mind constantly, acting like they can tell the future.It's almost as though multiple people are sharing different, contradictory, opinions.
