ETH GOT HACKED AGAIN AHAHAHAHAAHAreminder that if vitalik's personal funds were impacted, he would hard fork immediately
Anyone around during the DAO hard fork?
What happened to ERC20 altcoins during that time?
Specifically the fork not the news of the DAO.
nothing got hacked, there was a bug, yeah, funds frozen, but nothing got hacked.
learn to read, pajeet
fork for $50m>dont fork for $300m>just autistic things>play wow>other chars get nerfed that dont effect you, keep playing>your char gets nerfed, quitHe only makes changes if hes negatively effected like during the DAO.
Formally verified contracts when?
Over $250 million ETH were lost in another hack, the 3rd hack int he last year.It was so easy to fuck up Solidity, a noobie did it on accident!
AHAHAHAHAHAThe DAO Hack, the Parity Hack #1, and the Parity Hack #2 show just how shit Solidity is as a language, and how vulnerable and weak ETH is.
