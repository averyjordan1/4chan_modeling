Why is Bitshare's pumping you may ask?
Zephyr is only obtainable through BTS , USD and CNY on the decentralised exchange DEX (openledger.io).
Just look at the graph correlations, the price for BTS is increasing as it's acts as a entry to the ZEPH market.It's down the this little token that is the answer to all of your financial problems, check it out this one is going to be under the radar for long.Binance also enlisted BTS today, it's rumour to have ZEPH will be soon to follow.
Check out who Zephyr is backed by and support, but also their ecosystem attribute that aid's price growth.
I've still more research to do, but i am very confident on this one.
Anon.Thank me later.
gay
-.-
Ive been in this one too.
What I lack in meme lineology on charts, I make up for in knowing good projects that actually do something.
It will take a while but this is good use of chain.
Binance listing will send this sky high, BNB/ZEPH is gonna happen.Remember Nuls?
https://www.binance.com/trade.html?symbol=YOYOBNBLook... this token is already listed which came from DEX.
Sitting on a comfy 500k Zephyr from ICO.
Wow nice man, i wish i could buy more.
I scooped up 38k today.
Realworld blockchain application.
With all the bitching over tether, why not bitshares pegged fiat?
Yes anon, the asian are gonna love this shit too.
Once it hit's binance , whales are gonna be all over it.

This guy doesn't mention ZEPH though.How does he not see this.
Just bought another 5k.
I'm very hopeful for this, Bitshare's is now pumping further.
What is ZEPH?
Dude it's Zephyr , what i made this thread about.Look at the Bitshares graph and Zephyr graph above.https://zephyr.bitspark.io/Fiat related token.
180+ pegged fiat cryptocurrenciesThis sounds like a very complicated and grandiose endeavor.
But we will see if Tajikstan actually works out
Thanks for the tip.
Just bought ZEPH.
What are your thoughts on HERO?
I tried to start a thread about it earlier but it died with no responses.
How do I buyWhere from?
Alot on DEX (openledter.io)The HERO is a unit of digital currency whose value is mathematically pegged to the US dollar plus 5% APR since the Creature from Jekyll Island began printing it in 1913.Here is a steemit article from several months ago.

HEROMan this look's horrific, what's so special about it.Sorry but ZEPH has mucho more potential.
When does binance finally sell this???
I don't wanna deal with another exchange...

Top right bro
Try reading this - different that the article I posted above.https://steemit.com/bitshares/@ldauch/cryptonews-want-to-learn-more-about-the-bitshares-hero-coin This is a link to the website: http://www.sovereignhero.com/
https://steemit.com/bitshares/@ldauch/cryptonews-want-to-learn-more-about-the-bitshares-hero-coinLook's like a ponzi scheme.
It's gonna moon hard when it hit's there bro.
Probably Wendsday or Friday my guess.
4491951The Lamier shills are here for there un-dead brownie points Maybe if they spent time developing shit instead of shitting up forums they would be top 20 in coin marketcap.
Who the fuck are you new friend?
BitShares wouldn't list a ponzi scheme.
Perhaps that wasn't the best article to link.
Did you read this one?https://steemit.com/bitshares/@stan/the-hero-from-bitshares-island-5Here is some copy pasta:HERO is constructed in a way to transfer the risk away from the holder, who wants stable but modest returns.
It is the shorter or speculator, who must bear the fluctuations in the backing asset and optimistically expects significant appreciation of BTS in a growing and competitive market.
I don't care about EOS.Why dafuq are you posting that shiet ere.
Wrong pic
