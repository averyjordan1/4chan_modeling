Who else is spending his day riding those BTC/BCH waves?
I made $800 so far.
how you do this
I bought BCH for $2K at a BTC price of 0.18.
Sold it for 0.184.
Bought it back for 0.183, sold it for 0.186, bought it back for 0.183 and to be continued...Essentially buying low and selling high over and over again.I started lurking here about a week ago.
It has been a good week.
Can someone with more background knowledge tell me what the right terminology is for what I'm doing?
buy low sell high
damn, is that Latin or something?
