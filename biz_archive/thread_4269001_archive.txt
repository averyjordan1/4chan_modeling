Who here in litecoin getting comfy?
ETH LTC XMR are 80% of my stack right now
I'm all ETH and LTC.
Feels pretty fucking good
Finally in the fucking green.
Very comfy at $66 :^)
See ya down at $50 tomorrow, as usual
Tfw bought ~60 of them at $56
Yeah, I bet you said that yesterday, and the day before that too
if you got in under $60 you are sitting pretty for the rest of the yearill sell when it gets closer to 100
It's a shitcoin with no use, enjoy your final pump and dump.
$7.50 by december, litecucks
Is the pump over lads?
it's just starting
I think it'll hit $100 by EOY.
A non-holder I see.
Enjoy your pajeet-driven Wojacks.
