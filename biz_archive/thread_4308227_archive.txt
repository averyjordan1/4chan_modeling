Seriously though you'll have dumb money propping up BTC for a good while.
This is the best outcome.
>make episode on bitcoin 8 years later because le nerd xddd>so laggard that bitcoin turned into segshit and then promptly diedWho knows bitcoin cash might be renamed by that point
maybe it will make normies flood into bitcoin (formerly known as bitcoin cash) and prop up the marketthis is all turning out to be the perfect storm
they'll try to buy BTC and do things with it but they wont finish any transactions
