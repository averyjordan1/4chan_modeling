The ultimate fucking state of /biz/.
/biz/ has been /link/ for two months now and it's fucking awful

 I own 350k link and i just want these threads to stop.
bought a few thousand but this is just ridiculous, every day there are more than a dozen Link threads going on at once and that doesn't include the other threads that are hijacked for Link
4287669People said the same thing about the ETH threads around a year and a half ago when ETH was like $4, and there were at least 3 times as many ETH threads back then as there are LINK threads now.
no there really weren'tthere were a ton of ETH threads but it wasn't anywhere near the absolute shitposting that Link is getting
and I bet back then people were just as fucking tired of eth threads

Idk what you're talking about, ETH threads more or less single-handedly converted /biz/ into /crypto/
India just launched their own crypto.Buy Bitcoin Brown - the currency of the streets!
now that crytos are confirmed dunzo what is the next scheme for /biz/?are we back to drop shipping fidget spinners?
They were, and if they invested in ETH instead of throwing autistic tantrums about the spam, they would've made like 60x profit
/biz/ turned into /crypto/ when the alts boomed back in May, it wasn't just because of ETH
its all the bag-holders shilling it so they can sell
