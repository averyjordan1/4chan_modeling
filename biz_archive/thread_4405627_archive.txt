I'm in the process of buying a house.I declared about 7k worth of assets when I applied.It's a decent 130k home, I'm putting 3% down.So the loan officer sends me a program run by my state where they give downpayment assistance, but there's a 10k asset max limit for qualifying.
I told him I don't qualify.Should I lie and say I don't qualify because I will not live there for 9 years, or do I tell him I have more than 10k in assets?Can they deny my loan for something like that?Obviously I can't show proof for 2x as much as the loan in crypto, which is why I don't count it, I could lose it all in a day.
You have 7k in assets and the max is 10k, why are you saying you don't qualify?
I mean, even discounting my crypto.
I've gained like 4k in wages since I applied 2 months prior.I live with my parents, so all my money has been saved.
He lied and understated his assets.Prepare your asshole for an fucking, OP
I wouldn’t lie , it may disqualify you for the program.
Congrats starter homes in Seattle are $600k
I don't need the program.I'm just afraid I fucked myself up.From their point of view this is an amazing program.But from my point of view I'd be committing fraud by utilizing it.
I don’t know didn’t need a program we just went out and borrowed at low rates and qualified.Shit is up like $400k now ... it’s a Seattle home.Don’t lie on that loan shit it’s fraud.Remember that NJ housewife?
Lying on documents loans etc
You guys are all Crypto I’m thinking of dabbling.The thing I need to Moon is this Seattle real estate in 25 years
