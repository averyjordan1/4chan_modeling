Where can I can go to see or get alerted when new tethers are going to be issued?

$674 millions worth of tethers and $200 millions of them issued this month alone.
In the meantime BTC has gone from market cap has gone from $107 billions to $128 billions.For every Tether issued $100 worth of bitcoin has been added to the BTC market cap.
The whole "USDT has been propping up BTC prices" doesn't really make sense then.
Does it?

Liquidity does not equal volume.
The Markus and Willy bots on Mt.
Gox bought up about $100 million worth of BTC and it made the price move from $200 to $1200.
This is such a hard concept for people to understand, it's incredible how slow this information is taken up.
muh tether

https://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ypy58/the_truth_about_bitfinex_and_tether/this article is shit.
I don't care about your words, show me a statistical analysis.
If there isn't a graph with some kind of regression test or test for correlation I don't give a fuck.

What does this mean?The end is near?
Where is this from?
Some healthy concern is a good thing one tether is worth 0.955 USD right now but it is trading for 0.99 because of "faith" or maybe just ignorance.https://wallet.tether.to/transparency
Dang, hadn't noticed that they admit on their own site that USTD is NOT backed 1 to 1 with real dollars.So according to their own site, there are tethers in circulation not backed by dollars yet 1USDT = 1 USD at the moment.
Makes no sense.
