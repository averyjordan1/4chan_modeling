If i receive money from someone and this money was sent from an exchange wallet, can i send the money to the same wallet that sent me the money?Let's say you sent me the money from a Bittrex/Poloniex/NovaExchange wallet and i want to return you that money but i can not contact you, can i simply send the bitcoins back to the same wallet that sent me the bitcoins?
Bump.
yep!
Ye
no that is an aggregated wallet used by the exchange.
they wont know what to do with the coins they receive
They create new addresses for each account though, right?
Don't do it, it's a bad ideathey create new addresses to recieve and track the incoming.
They send out from hot wallets which will send out on behalf many account holderd at once
