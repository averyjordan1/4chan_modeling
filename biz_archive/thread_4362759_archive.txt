What happened to Cofound.it (CFI)?
I've been out for some tome, and it lost a lot of value.
it continued doing what it does best : nothing
you should have listened
Here's the problem that only a select few investors of supreme intelligence foresaw: any project with a really good idea doesn't need an incubator in this market.Because of this you're left with average ideas and average projects.
Look at the first couple projects to come out.
Digital art ownership, digital music ownership, tether rip off that's supposed to appreciate in value, ICN rip off, hell Santiment was actually a legit project and they even tried to limit the CFI involvement as much as possible once they got funding elsewhere.
I got a 220% benefit, but I was too greedy, and I lost it all.Interesting point of view.
What is your prediction for the next months?
CFI, one of the coins we traded during the Glorious Altcoin Summer of 2017.
I made like 30% on this and sold.That glorious period where you would have made gains on absolute shitcoins like Patientory.
PatientoryI lost with that nigga-coin.
