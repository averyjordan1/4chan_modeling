Is anyone in on this?
ya, bought around a btc at 50k sats.figure it can't go that much lower.worst case scenario I lose .2 or so
its going to tank, devs on vacation for 1 month
50k is solid.
I went ahead and bought at 54k a few hours ago.
I made 20% on its decline over a week because of the massive spread on the ETH pairOther than that, isn't it just a bad Tenx?
Proof?Tenx and mtl are barely related.
That's a good call going with the ETH pair.
I did not look at that, but I wish I would have.
I don't know anything about the currency as far as its utility.
I just saw that it looked like a good time to buy TA wise.
Especially when looking at the 1 day chart.
Nope.
No ICO.. only gave tokens to insiders for like 5 cents... no lock up period , they could dump and implode the whole thing
barely relatedBut they're both crypto payment solutionsSure one is PoW and one is PoPP (or some shit), but their utility is the same.
It's like saying LTC and BTC are barely related because they have different algorithms.
only gave tokens to insiders for like 5 centsBrilliant idea.Then one of the advisor sell off the day of Alpha release and halved their marked cap.Congrats on this Marshall, seriously.The project was good, Vault is a nice wallet, it might even be normies friendly, but they fuck up.I might get it again around the Necker Cup if it has potential for a pump.
