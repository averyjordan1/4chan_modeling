"Honestly, I don't know where you Millennials expect to get by just sitting around blaming boomers for everything.
First off, my distinguishable narcissism will never allow me to admit that any of it is my fault.
You always complain that you can't find a job?
Why don't you just borrow $50,000 from your parents to start your own business?
Or, why don't you just work a trade job.
How dare you Millennials not want to work a stable job cleaning a waste sewage pond or work as an air condition repairman for the rest of your life?
You're making me look like a bad parent.
I need you to be employed somewhere so I can brag about your job and inflate it to sound way better than it really is so that my boomer friends at the annual CHRISTMAS party and I can all pretend it's still the 1960's and that we have had absolutely no impact on the fabric of first world society in the past 50 years.
I think it's time for all of you to B-T-F-O or whatever it is the kids say these days.
