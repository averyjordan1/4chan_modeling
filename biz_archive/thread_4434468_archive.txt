Everyone who invests in OMG and similar """""payment gateway""""" cryptos legitimately believes they're going to make a killing using their laptop as a payments processor.https://www.cardfellow.com/credit-card-processing-fees/Tell me how you expect to beat these rates and make a living with your ~2,500 OMG.Go on, I'll wait.
Please note: the largest part of this, the interchange rate, would not even go to the OMG network if some analogous thing existed.It's for the bank who gave you the credit card
MAth makes me feel dumb so I'm not going to read that
Perfect encapsulation of /biz/ in one post.You're all going to get pink wojak'd by this market, btw

For the retarded anons like My link demonstrates that, in a $50 transaction, the VISA entity would only collect about 27 cents, or a 0.54% fee.That's the -current- market standard for processors.You have to beat that.
Significantly.

You can buy ETH and go into any other crypto

It's okay if you got convinced into buying an unprofitable public works project of Vitalik.There's still time to get out
Pyramids were used by ancient aliens to communicate with Phobos.
Just because you think niggers built them for no reason doesn't make them scams, Rebecca.
Because they can do around a .01%-1% fee and still be profirable
4434468are you seriously saying that those rates cannot be beaten by a platform like omisegoand nobody is talking about making a living with his 2.5k oms
I'm sure they can be beaten.I'm just saying you're not making much of anything with OMG with rates so low
