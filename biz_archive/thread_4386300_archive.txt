Is it me, or do companies these days absolutely refuse to hire anybody on a whim anymore if they have a good intuition about the person they are interviewing?
I mean if someone fresh out of an ivy league school with absolutely no real-world experience walks into a job interview for a high paying position, they will more than likely get that job over someone that is slightly older with no college degree but has a few years of work experience in that field.
I'm self-taught several in-demand computer languages, yet I'm in a computer school now because literally no one will hire me unless I have something on my resume saying I went to school for it.
