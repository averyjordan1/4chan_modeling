If you make a million dollars in june, but then lose 900 k of it october, how does the taxing work?
Will you owe tax of a million dollars, even if you lost it before the end of the year.
You might be able to claim it as losses.
Worst case, you declare bankruptcy.
Just keep track of everything, you'll only end up paying taxes on 100k
you only get taxed on profit dick waffle
Did you get DGB'd?
Depends on your country, if you're from the US you'll get taxed based on how much you paid in vs returns.
So if you dumped in $10,000 it balloons to $1,000,000 and back down to $100,000 then you cash out, you'll only get taxed on the $90,000 you physically made
