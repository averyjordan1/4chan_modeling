two sell walls set up on Substratum.. accumulating whale bastards..
Yeah I got holdings in sub, it hit 2k multiple times and looking to go there again, maybe this time it breaks free and goes to 2800 sats
Its binance thing and binance fate of any coin that cant get huge volume pump to obliterate or scare whales sell walls.Nothing to see move on (not from SUB acually one of few fucking legit projects).Gl anons
i'm holding 150k SUB until Binance party.. the idea of Binance + the planned coin burn completes me... then i'll sell 50% and HODL the rest forever
dammit, *bittrex
