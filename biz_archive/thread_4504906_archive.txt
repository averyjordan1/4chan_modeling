Why does Bcash move in steps like this?
Fucking weird.
It's like someone decides the price.
One day it's 1180 totally stable and next day it's 1280 then totally stable.
When it gets low enough someone market buys.
That's what is happening.

stairway to heaven formation
they do this shit every two weeks or so.. i've stopped giving a shit.
price goes down to  and chinks quickly pump it back up to 1300 and set buy/sell walls so that it stays there, but ppl keep dumping this shit and it slowly goes back down to  again.
