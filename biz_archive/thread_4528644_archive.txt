I'm new to crypto.
What is the best exchange for trading in USD?
I'm probably gonna start out with BTC, ETH, LTC as they're the most common base currencies paired with USD.>GDAXHas all three, my choice atm.>GeminiBTC, ETH>KrakenHas all three plus a few other altcoins>BitstampHas all three plus XRP>BitfinexHas all three and the most altcoins of the exchanges listed here.
Heard there was some controversy with this one though regarding ties to Tether.
As soon as Kraken fixes their trading being broken 50% of the time, when the website is not down completely, it's going to be the best.
GDAX.
Bitfinex has a better interface, but you don't know when Bitfinex will become insolvent.
Also have a look at Coinigy.
Gives you stop loss orders even if exchange does not support them.
