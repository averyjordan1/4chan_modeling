all these ICO scams are leading up to new solutions being developed by the community, i recently read an article on r/ethereum (pls no bully) that went over an alternative to ICOs that uses opportunity cost instead of capital, pretty interestingimo exit scams like this are inevitable, but open nature of the Ethereum ecosystem allows it to 'repair' itself much quicker than other systems (such as bitcointalk ICOs back in 2013) since other people can develop alternatives that are safer for investors.
