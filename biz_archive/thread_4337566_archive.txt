What's your thoughts on this crypto
Good for daytrading.
Might silently moon or get pumped up by asians anytime tho.
why is it good for daytrading.
im looking at the daily chart and it seems on a downtrend.
strong support at .71 though
It has 8mb blocks, fast txs, and has maintained value within +/-5% through the current fuck show.
I use it as a safe liquid storage in my wallet to jump in and out of coins.
You can put $1000 in it and come back 3 days later and still have your $1000 to move around, it is in my opinion one of the best coins that exists right now.
Shitcoin.
It won't die anytime soon because the community is decent, but also has no chance to outperform btc.
LITECOIN is not designed nor expected to outperform bitcoin!!!!
This was even mentioned by the creator C Lee.It is regards the silver to gold and little brother to BTC!
This.Also only reason it's that high is because Charlie Lee worked at Coinbase and pushed its shitcoin on the exchange so brainlets can buy it seeing the low price and thinking it will be the next bitcoin, if not it would be next to DGB on CMC.
le silver crypto
Bitcoin testnet, that's all.
no chance to outperform btc.haha kid you do realize it already is outperforming btc, you know by actually being a functioning crypto able to be used for its intended purpose.
holy fucking deluded legacy btc babbies.
