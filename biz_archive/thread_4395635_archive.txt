Cryptocurrencies are a black swan, governments never saw them coming and completely unprepared to deal with them.
Monetary policies in the last 40 years operated under the assumption that governments would always have full control of monetary supply, so extremely expansionary policies didn't seem to have a downside, after you couldn't have liquidity without fiat.
But crypto has utterly destroyed the assumptions mainstream economics have worked under for so long, and no one, no matter how knowledgeable he think he is has any clue about what will happen in the near future.
