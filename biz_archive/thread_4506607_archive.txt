Is this a good price to get in on LINK?
I got a feeling it’s genna go lower but idk.
No
GET IN NOW YOU WILL NEVER SEE 15 CENTS EVER AGAIN
yeah it's a great price, but if you want you could also just take a giant pile of money and burn it, you'll have the same outcome but there's less stress burning a pile of money than becoming a deluded Linkey and missing moon missions daily.
The best part of chainlink is that it makes you extremely humble, you think to yourself “this can’t possibly go lower” so you buy in and lo and behold it drops another 200 sats.
>This is the last time you'll see link under X cents
tfw you realise sirgay is flaunting his philosophy chops
