This coin eliminated its asset contract on the 20th.
The asset contract was literally the only thing that gave it value.
As the chart here shows, smart money got out on the first and.... literally that is it.
Dumb money still hasn't learn.
The coin is literally fucking worthless.
tldr: The efficient market hypothesis does not hold for crypto, even in the weak sense.
nice fud, the CEO is working on giving the token the same functionality without it beeing deemed a secuirity.
TenX and Tokencard are not so forward thinking, so they will be delisted from major exchanges soon.sage goes in all fields

At the ICO the token was supposed to have the asset contract which was potentially extremely valuable.
Now it has nothing.
The market is clearly not rational so who the fuck knows.
Dumb money still hasn't learn.Loving this thread...." The coin is literally fucking worthless.

I bought it today just because there was a dip for no fucking reason.
I then researched it and found out it was shit, so I sold it for a 5% profit.
Good going, anon.
