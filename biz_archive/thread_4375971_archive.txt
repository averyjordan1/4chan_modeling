Fellow /biz/fagsIt has been confirmed - rebrand to BeanCash + new release coming in the next few days!!
Look at the charts, interesting increase in volume over the past few days.
Whales are trying to keep the price down for now.
Core developer said 100 sats is easily possible..DYOR and stake the coin for extra profit!
I was all excited when I saw this thread in the catalog and expected them to rebrand to something cool, but no they just pick another retarded name.
