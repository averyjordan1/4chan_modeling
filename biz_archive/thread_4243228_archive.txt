>In the world of cryptocurrency, the common malicious contracts have qualities such as infinite minting, or transfers of tokens without balance checks.
This is deliberately implemented by nefarious developers to cheat their own buyers out of their ETH.
Other times it's unintentional, and the issues are actually programming errors.
eBTC is an example where through a programming error, there is accidental infinite printing.
eDOGE is another example, which had a centralized locking mechanism that prevented trading, and allowed for manipulation of the market.Well maybe, just maybe, if we had a system where Ethereum Blue was in place, we could have prevented the fuck up that multi-sig wallets cause.300 million dollars worth of Ethereum wouldn't be out un a dark abyss if we had Ethereum Blue.Just sayin
