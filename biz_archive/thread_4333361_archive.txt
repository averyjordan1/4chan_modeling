So if I'm buying and selling shit coin with ETH, is the price of the shit coins influenced by the current ETH price?
If I am selling my shit coins for a 5% gain, but the price of ETH has risen 5%, does that mean i've gained nothing from selling the shit coin?
I need help
you shouldn't be in crypto until you understand this stuff.
Who's the semen demon?
I'm not in it, that's exactly why I'm asking questions.
So I can get into it.
I'll make it simple for you OP.As long as whatever you are holding is going up or steady, thats good.If ETH is going down, that means you can now buy more with your shitcoin.Its bad if ETH rises in your example, as you get less.
When Bitcoin was mooning, it sucked to be in alts because of this phenomenon.
So in the ideal world your currency is the one that is going up while all other are going down.
thanks for the precise answer mate
