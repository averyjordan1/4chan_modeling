Asians are buying.
We're not at the top yet.
Asians use bittrex to buy VTC?What are you smoking bud
Sorry guys but I had a stop loss trigger by accident, so we're gonna have to crash a little bit so I can get back in.
Sorry for the delay, but moon must temporarily delay sorry moon.
Just how high can this go if we get the highly conservative 5% of the market cap of BCH?
lol, I hope you guys dumped while it's high.... you can always get back in when it dips again...Bought in at 895 and sold at 1005
This is a great coin but it will not have it's day until at least the beginning of 2018
