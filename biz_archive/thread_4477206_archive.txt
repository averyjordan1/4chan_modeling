I've been putting some thought into starting a drop-shipping business with probably crypto-related shirts, and maybe dabbling into some normie interests to appeal to a wider market.
Has anyone here attempted a drop-shipping business, or currently are running one?How did you go about setting it up?
And what do you think of the resource/time efficiency compared to the profits?This would not be my only source of income and I don't expect it to replace my others, I just want to know if its worth the time.
I don't think it's worth your time.
There are already a lot of AliExpress flippers doing this.
Margins are very weak and you don't have a unique product and you can't apply any brand marketing on it.So you will always be selling cheap shit, and """"customers"""" treat is as shit and are going to start to haggle.In the case of printing on t-shirts with a unique design you might have a chance.
Cheap printed t-shirts are tourist city gift shop tier.
You can do better than that.
id just an hero before i sold a shirt that said #hodl on it
