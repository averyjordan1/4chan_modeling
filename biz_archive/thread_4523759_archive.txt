Yesterday I sold powr, got some meh gains and bought bch at 0.17.
I think I will wait til bch hits 0.2.
Once this happens I gtfo and buy powr again which I think it will hit 9k before going to the moon again.Is this an ok plan?
buy powr soon, it's going past $1 by Monday.
MondayThat's a lot of time specially considering operation dragon slayer incoming.
I expect x3 this weekend.
