How high will b trash go
Maybe 100$ more, but that's just inertia, sales volume is 2:1 to buying volume.
It's time to get out.
xD bitcoin cash more like bitcoin trash
there is twice as much selling as buying>price keeps mooningkek
Volumes.
You can sell $1 worth of BCH at a higher price and it will show on candle if someone buys it, but doesn't mean shit.
That's why you always look at volumes.
and volume is falling fast, watch out for the dump everyone!!!
