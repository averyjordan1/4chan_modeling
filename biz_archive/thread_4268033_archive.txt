Had to say goodbye to the most loveable cat I've ever had this morning, she was only 22 years young and it was the toughest thing I've ever done.Rest In Peace Hendrix, you will be missed.
Any donations would be greatly appreciated to help me through these difficult times.
Thank you for your generosity.12zJbKAeQDuDVgDHFMc82BvpkmqHzVXmnT

cute cat OP and if your stories true than i send condolences but you shouldn;t be asking for money.Don't think i've ever seen anyone EVER ask for money because someone has died.
