there are 3 "symbol groups": shape with filled in rectangle, shape with striped rectangle and shape without fill.every symbol group moves 1 to the right after every row.
(if shape was all the way to the right it starts again at the left position on the next row.
)the shapes of the symbols are generally squares.
however from down left to up right the shapes change to triangles.there are 3 "states" of the rectangle shape in the middle of the symbols: horizontal, vertical, diagonal.we are looking for the next piece of the "shape with filled in rectangle".
the triangle already occured, so it's got to be a square.
the only position state of the rectangle shape left is the diagonal position one, hence number 5 being the correct answer.there is more to this picture but this would be one possible solution to the problem
the answer is you have better things to do with your timet.

Every line has 1 of each - filled, stripped, empty rectanglesThe last line is mising the full one so it is 3 or 5None of the previous lines changed the direction of the rectangle so it must be 5 becase three is vertical while 5 is tilted, just like the empty and striped rectangles in the last line
