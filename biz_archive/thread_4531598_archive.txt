where mah dragon tamers at
eta for when it will be listed to an exchange?
I almost bought this ICO
Here.
Checking out their "Merch" for a laugh.
Oh yeah those uncapped ICOs for failed projects really get me pumped.
Right here.Why should it be capped?
Do projects NOT have the right to collect as much funds as they can?
You don't see many fundraisers capping their campaigns; they keep it going.
It should be capped if the people who buy at ICO have any expectation of making a profit, otherwise anyone that wants to can get in and there's no demand.It should also be capped because, unlike fundraising, a crypto startup should have an articulate product that doesn't need infinite money to develop.
Saying "Give us as much money as you can and we'll do something awesome with it" is absolutely ridiculous.
tfw you realize operation dragonslayer is just this ICOkek
