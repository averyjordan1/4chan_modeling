Guys, remember.
ALWAYS buy AFTER the price has gone up and sell your bags when the price has dropped.
Never buy low and sell high.
It's the /biz/ way.
Just bought 100k BCH.
Will buy more if climb more.
nice larping
Never consider buying at a dip.
Never look at what's going to go up next week or next month.
Always buy what has already gone up and is at ATH.
exactly this, never buy a dip ,buying a dip especially now in BTC is considered "catching a falling knife"buy into bch at all time high because it is the rare exception that it will go higher
Duh, you always buy at the ATH and sell at the dip.Are you thinking we're retards OP, we know what we're doing.
