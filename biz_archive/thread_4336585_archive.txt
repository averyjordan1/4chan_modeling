So, newfags, how did the last days made you feel?you really think anything can stop BTC?Normies only know bitcoin, why should a fork of this shitcoin lead to a flippening?
even digibyte has higher chances.You got weak hands?
Sold everything at a loss?
Congrats!We are just starting on the bumpy road to glory 2018!
If you havent been comfy the last days because you do not believe in crypto as a whole, why not quit and invest like a boomer?
May be better for your heart....
*blocks your coup*Like I said 2 days ago.
If ETH couldn't do it, that Chinese pajeetcoin stood no chance
Miners will be incentives to stay on the BCH chain.
Since diff adjust every block if it becomes less profitable than BTC and the miner jumps over to BTC, BCH chain will start to adjust the diff the next block.
Mining reward will also rise as the number of fee paying transaction will fill up and the miner can claim up to 8mb of those transactions.
On the BTC chain if it becomes unprofitable the miner jumps over to BCH, BTC won't react up to 2016 blocks to reduce diff and since 1mb are already full the only way to incentives miners back onto the BTC chain is to increase transaction fees and the last couple of days has shown how this effects Bitcoin.
And to think all of this could've been avoided if core just increased the block size.
Deluded, bchs only hope is if the price is over btc during the fork.
Else, it will never be more profitable to mine than btc.
Only reason why bch succeeded this long is due to EDA.
If difficulty is adjusted every block, it will make sure that block interwall will be 10min all the time.
Bch was only profitable to mine after EDA kicked in and blocks started to fall 40blocks/hr.. clearly situation will be different if difficulty is adjusted all the time not allowing more than 10blocks/hr
