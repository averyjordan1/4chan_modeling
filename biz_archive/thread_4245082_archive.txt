After watching Confido go 16x in the first day, I need to ask, how the fuck do you find about about these ICOs before it's too late to get on the rocket?I heard about Confido around 10 days ago but by then the whitelist was closed, and I missed out.Is there a website or something that lists ALL upcoming ICOs?
Anybody?
Somebody must know

In Confido's case /biz/ was a pretty good source, it got several threads during the whitelist period, and a couple were even active for a brief moment before the stage 1 got filled.
If your schedule doesn't allow you to check at all hours of the day, then whenever you normally DO check take a look at the archives and find threads from when you're normally asleep.
That ensures you won't miss anything.
