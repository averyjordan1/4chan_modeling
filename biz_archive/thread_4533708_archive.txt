Tell your wife to use "I feel" much less.
Removing it entirely or at least using "I think".
It makes her seem unsure of herself and not willing to really put her weight behind her opinion.
It's a common mistake women make.It's an OK post, but it doesn't really offer any solution.
I guess it's a way to start a conversation by highlighting an issue that imo is important and should be discussed at this juncture in crypto.Overall the post has a good net benefit for the crypto community.
Give your wife some praise and cook her a good meal.
are you a homosexual?
No, I'm just gay.
She's not wrong.
But we live in a (((capitalist))) world.
We have to compete to survive

Crypto Twitter is where real conversation happens.
The community is actually there.
