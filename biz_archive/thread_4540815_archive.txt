I have an offer from pic related for a position as Consultant (soon to be Senior Consultant) in Digital Banking & Financial Services.
They like me to focus on Blockchain.
Thoughts?Is it truly the future technology that will change so many aspects of our lifes?
Never work for this company
presents themselves as a SME and qualified to provide advice to others>asks biz for the scoopFuck you, lazy nigger.
Do your own work.
why not?
everyone i know there likes it a lot
if you dont realize blockchain will be a huge part of the future, that company should let you go because youre shit
If you want to have to put up with shit from their clients then yes will be a good job.
