Which coin/asset will 10x in month and why?
One thing i can tell you.
It is NOT REQ oor LINK.I repeat>NOT REQ>NOT LINK
I stopped chasing the 1 in 1000 coin.I look with RSI and MA which coin is underbought and i buy them when they are cheap.
They rise for 20% and i sell them and move on.
I dont have 1. te fucking time to try every shitcoin out there with 5 page White paper that is shilled on this shitsite2.
the nerves for a 10 min pump action
Anything you have the balls to trade at 100x leverage on bitmex that moves even 10%You don't need a coin to 10x if you grow a pair
REQ and LINK are all over /biz/ because these pot favs bought high and don’t want to sell low so are trying to convince us intellects to buy.
no chance of that happening when $XVG and $KMD are ready to take off.
hopefully my btc lolim scared.
its going down and bch keeps going up and im just tryingto hold like bros sayI dont want keep loosing money tho
Pajeet hates link because link will buy all toilets in the world and bombard India with it in 2020
so you're saying I should buy REQ and LINK?
Do whatever you want.Did a good x4 since presale from LINKDid a good 50% from REQBoth are wasting your time, there are plenty of moon mission until either of one will have any impact / heavy increases.
You get it.
That seems like a good strategy thx
