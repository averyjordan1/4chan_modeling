I'm getting out of the gsme, /biz/.
Too much volatility right now and I'm too poor to mess around with it.
I'll be taking my modest gainz and bouncing the fuck out for now, maybe monitor shit and hop back in if things look right someday.
i wanna go back tho :(
Same.
Market is way too volatile right now, and some people will come out winners while most will lose money.
I'll be waiting to see what happens after this shitfest is over.
you only lose if you sell at a loss
