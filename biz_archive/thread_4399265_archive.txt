Daily reminder that this "stupid crypto YouTuber" has been making good calls all month.This same YouTuber explained in 3 different videos why ChainLink would fail, and you didn't listen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxD6ceooa0U&feature=youtu.be&t=15m50sIt's never too late to learn from your mistakes, Biz.
The guy can't even tell the difference between pnd and lack of hype.Thinks link s the same as xrp and other coins.Has no idea about anythingDoesn't know what he's talking aboutDidn't read the whitepaperHe's salty because he bought at 50 cents and is bagholding ever since thenLet this faggot die and buy the dip
This guy has been discretided multiple times.
Keep trying though, proves rent free meme
The guy can't even tell the difference between pnd and lack of hype.Nah he does, the linked time in this video doesn't give the full context.
He explains this better from the beginning.>Has no idea about anythinghyperboleFake newsCan you guys at least be honest?
I know it sucks that LINK is down, but the fact is he was right.
this guy is retarded.Chainlink isn't expected to do anything until Q2 2018.It would be like going to bitcoin in 2009 when it first started and saying WOW IT FAILED.why do people spam this retarded video when its clear he has no clue about the tech?he also compares its marketcap to a credit card company, which makes no sense at all.
not even the same industry.
Why Q2?
What is the logic behind this?
for the price to go up, it requires users.
The mainnet is not even up yet.Confido has confirmed they're using it, REQ says they like it and are considering using it.SWIFT would obviously be huge.The only thing that could drive the price up is news of SWIFT confirming they're actually using it, or mainnet going up before its expected.SIBOS toilet bowl was PACKED, everyone in that room was watching sergey intently.Customer conversation with rory : "what happens if Chainlink gets too expensive, say $5?"
Rory: you pass the cost onto whoever is using the data.
What's the ETA for mainnet?
Is that why people say Q2?
