Can bcash just fucking stop?Everyone is having a real comfy time watching their alts and coins rising, even normies with their 100% BTC portfolios are content with the slow growth.
Suddenly Roger and retarded FOMO investors decide it's time to PnD BCH.All the altcoins start weakening, majority of people don't care about BCH increasing as they didn't buy in to this powergrab, comfy atmosphere disappears, the 2-3 people here who bought in immediately start making threads and shilling.BCH returns to where it was before by the next morning.
>"majority of people"You are not the majority.
neither are you, Vercuck.
You are not the majority.The majority support Bitcoin not your retarded Bcash, fuck off to suck chink dick faggot.
The the pageet minority, thinks they are a majority.
Go back to where you came from Pajeet, Bitcoin cash is going to fuckk you up the bum if you want to fuckk!
>implying I have more BCH than BTCDumb niggers, I just like seeing 30% gains instead of 5%.
