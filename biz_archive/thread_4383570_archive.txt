LOL and people think Bitcoin is "decentralized"
Actually is controlled by a well known Cypherpunk.
Retard.
This
Feature not a bug.BTC is being positioned as the one world currency that the elite fags so desperately want.
BTC is their way to think that we came up with the idea all by ourselves.Knowing this HODL bitcoin because it's going to be worth a lot.
They will crash it then scoop it up and then it will rise.
Lightening centralizing the network is what they want.
After BTC becomes the standard, they will have complete control over the world masses.
No more tax evasion, criminals won't be able to live comfortably, etc.
