I bought 5 BTC in January 2016 and held till yesterday.I sold them for Bitcoin Cash and will hold this coin for at least 1 year (since gains are tax free in Germany if you hold for 1 year).I recommend BTC bagholders to do the same.
How do you properly prove hold for 1 year?
By showing them the buy date and the sell date... Duh
holy shit you faggots are annoying.
looks like its time to filter Bitcoin Cash
How many Bitcoin Cash for an hour with this succubus?
