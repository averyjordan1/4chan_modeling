POWR looks like it could be great, but HOW do you generate new POWR tokens?Because if it isn't tied directly to energy creation, it is just another pozzed speculation-ridden shitcoin.
why dont you read the whitepaper
I'm literally reading the white paper rn, and I can't figure it out.They have "Token Generation Events" which appears to be their word for ICO, but I can't figure out how the tokens are actually generated.
Link sand bags detectedRead the fucking white paper its pretty ingenius actually.
Sparkz are a local currency based token for power trading.
POWR is a market dictated value of worth.
POWR can be used to 'rent' power assets.
You place POWR into a solar farm and you get a proportional return.
They use a secondary token called Spark or Sparq or some shit which is generated and traded.
The POWR coin I believe is more akin to shares in the company.
Just go watch some videos with Jemma long face whatever the fuck her name is.
They have some informative Q&As
4413990I have read the whitepaper and there is a lot of good ideas in there.
But what is so difficult to understand about my question?
How do POWR tokens get made?
It is a simple question.
Not quite sure if they've generated a billion already or they had a cap at the ICO.

I've got 200k POWR, but this is really a long term hold of 12+ months.
Price will increase from their roadmap quite soon.
Surprisingly this is one of the ONLY ICOs that is actually working and has a tested case scenario.
