Hey, some rumors circulating that tZero ICO will be held on XCP protocol.
An ico of this size would be huge for XCP considering the low supply of the coin (2.6 MIL).
Anybody knows about this?
Lol no.
Overstock was previously attempting to build this platform on Counterparty, but abandoned it due to technological limitations of the BTC blockchain.
They will probably use the EVM desu.
I saw an article that they hired 3 devs from XCP.
Who knows...
