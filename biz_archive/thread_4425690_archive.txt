I’m in BTC for $1k right now, I’m sitting on another $10k.
I’m sticking to the main coins, and am specifically interested in BTC and ETH.
Low risk long term (3+ year) investments.
I have a strong feeling bitcoin is set to take a major hit in the next 2-3 weeks based on industry speculation, so I may pick up in mid December.
Alternatively, ETH is a safe investment today with minimal growth.
Which would you buy, when, and why?
BlockMason is a safe bet for the next few weeks..It has a working platform and producfs out, just had its ICO and proceeded to list on Binance, Etherdelta and Kucoin.
Announcements coming next week and its still at 10m market cap for now.Hard to lose out when they already have a product to show
