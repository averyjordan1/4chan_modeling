Is it smart to wait for bubbles to burst and then jump in?
I was just thinking about the global financial crisis and how everything eventually started going back up, and if you had a nice nest egg saved it would have been smart to buy stocks when everyone else was jumping out of windows because of them.
That's the way to do it.
Wait till there is blood in the streets to buy.
Doesn't matter if it takes 5 years.
It's smart to buy stocks in sectors of the economy that aren't in a bubble state and won't be drastically affected by other major sectors crashing down.Then you sell and buy from other sectors cheap after they bottom, but be sure the company you buy is actually one that will recover, because every bubble contains a lot of companies that were bad and will die after the crash.
depends when you're buying inif the market is growing at 10% annually, and you are sitting on cash for 10 years waiting for it to crash, and it doesn't, you just lost out on a shitload of money.
and when it finally does correct, and loses a gargantuan amount, like 80% of its value, you still have less than what you would have had.but yes, it's smart to be sitting on some cash for either 5% corrections, or massive dumps.
