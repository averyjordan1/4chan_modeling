Spoonfeed me on why these coins are special, why people say on /biz that it's the next hot shit (that ridiculous grost pump etc).
Whats proof of stake, how does it work etc thanks.
Spoonfeed me mommyyyyyyyy
They are environmentally friendly lol
you get more returns from staking than you do from holding a good stock portfolio for a year
With POS Miners can only mine as much new blocks as they already hold, so if you own 1% of total coin (your stake) in circulation, you can mine up to 1% of it.I don't understand why this is better, I think the idea is it takes the power away from the miners and puts it back into the holders of the currency since it forces miners to accumulate - but that sounds like it could concentrate power to them againSo to answer your question I have no fucking idea, but neither does 80% of the fuckers investing in crypto
Be like me.Buy ODN at the lowest right now.Stake the coins on a raspberry pi.Get 10% reward annually.Lambo in 2 years.Yes i have 2.5mil coins
when you put it that way i want to sell.
environmental friendliness is not profitable for any business

It's pretty dense but basically the tldr is pos just moves the "work" around in a shell game but doesn't really come out to any resource savings.
Also, distributions are far more centralized in PoS
