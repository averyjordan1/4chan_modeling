Obvious prediction:Ignoring BCH for a moment, Bitcoin is obviously going to fall to under $6k.
There's no 2 ways about it.
The only thing pushing it to new ATHs was the fork.
I'm thinking, maybe $5.5k is gonna be the new support level.
Alts are going up after the BCH drama unfolds.
I think BCH will keep going up for another day or two, maybe edge $1.8k and then get back down to $900 or so.
Good coins to hold are:- VTC, going to $5.5 or more- NEO- XMR- ARK
