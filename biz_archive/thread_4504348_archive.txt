Oh you poor soul.Binance is just an app to help you record and keep track of what's in your portfolio.Blockfolio is an actual exchange where you buy and sell cryptocurrency.
What you want is blockfolio.
But in order to use it you have to send a "confirmation deposit" that will be refunded to you, of 0.01 BTC.
