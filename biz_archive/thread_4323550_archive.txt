so would BCH have overtaken BTC last night if the Korean exchange Bithumb didn't crash?
It blasted through .5 BTC right before Core shut it down
yea im getting word of what the next moves r, i would hold bcc safest bet but u can sel; n buy btc for some profit n then sell btc for bcc , bcc will moon again
No because it was an obvious pump and dump scheme from the start.
BCH holders are so distraught after yesterday's losses that they can't even get the ticker right.I guess this board is going to be filled with bagholders shilling BCH for a while now
Well, apart from the gains that I extracted from the exchange, I'm at a loss.
It happens.
If it couldn't be brought back up after the exchange coming back it wasn't gonna happen.
They were the majority volume and controlled everything
