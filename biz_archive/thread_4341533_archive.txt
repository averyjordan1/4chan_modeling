https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedge/Total supply is 5 mil and price is around 1$ should i buy this on etherdelta?
nobody?
No, pump's over.Their funds are locked due to the Parity Walletbug.
Check this out instead, anon.I will give you 1 BTC in 3 months if this doesn't go over $50.
is that zcash?
zcoin, apologies for the incorrect title
My question is if dev funds got locked there would be less total supply and this means pump might happen in soon?
Why this didnt hit dip then?
10 cent or less?
nobody has opinion about this token?
