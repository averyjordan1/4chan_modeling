ITS DUMPING
IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
i am confident this is the coin that will be shilled in the next pbc
4000 here we gooo
Hopped in at 3.2k sats.Does this thing have any long-term potential or is it just a P&D?Any promising business connections?Their team on their website look like a bunch of inbred Britbongs.... must be legit.
dude its a coin made by some woman in Australia.
Look promising at first, but then:1.
Woman2.
Energy coin (WTF?)3.
Invaded by PajeetsExpect PND.
this is actually a good coin.
had my eye on it for a very long time now.
you will see an omise go level run
MERCURY IS MOONING FUCK THIS TRASHCOIN
It's legit, been on australian national news.
Long term hold man
4350363I've been trading this beauty constantly on binance, its good.
I like the coin, but please don't lump me in with the link and request fanatics.
Been swing trading this on binance but sold most my stash before the listing on bittrex, didn't know it'll happen.Fuck off, this is bascially said about every fucking coin
you're an idiot
So Bittrex today, AMA in 12 hours and PBC report in 2 days?Sounds like an easy x5.
LOL already mooned
4350399This coin has no value.
I would even pay even if it is 10 cents.
The fact that a Bittrex listing only brought up the price by 15~20% over should tell you something about it being a long hold.
Also the chairman is a mayor of one of Australia's cities and has many connections to the government, and given New Zealand's plans to operate on more efficient power, we could be seeing lots of support from them as well.
TLDR this week SHOULD be positive for POWR as a short-term hold, but it'll take at least half a year before it gets anywhere as a long-term hold.
You are new to crypto
Am I late?
No
Power Ledger is the only legitimate ICO since Omise Go.
It won't do Omise Go levels but it will do it at about half the rate and then double once it is shilled by PBC in 2 days.Here is Omise Go for reference.
The line is where we are now and resembles Omise Go when it was added to bittrex.
The market was smaller back then too.
The circle is where I see this pumping this week after the PBC report.
Gtfo then.
We don't need your 10 Rupees, Rakesh.
.The best Crypto project to date.
Bring on $1.
Perfect time to get in.
It's a small breather after the first pump.
smelly hairy pajeets.makes me wonder if they'll transfer powr coins to stocks and put it on the asx
THIS
quality shilling on bizwtf
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WHAT THE FUCK WHY WONT IT GO BACK UP
ever heard of p-priced in?
It is downhill from here onward.
Sell if i were u.
I don't mind people using charts for examples like that but you can use that method for many other coins out there you know that right?
Liquidate into SLR - it's what you meant to buy in the first place
> went all in at .00065 ETH> panicked> got out at .00066 ETHPhew, thank fucking god
guys i just sold some on accident at like %25 below the going rate... FML noob mistake.
luckily it was only 15 dollars so i lost 3.75 to being a retard and not looking at the going rate.
you'll be succesful, keep going like that
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK YOU FUCKING CUNTSI COULDVE BOUGHT MERCURYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK YOU ALLWHY DID YOU SHILL THIS SHITCOIN TO MEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFUCK YOUFUCKINGIUHSODGFJSDF
Jesus you people have no patience!
Didn't get a Lambo in 5 seconds and you think your life over ...
Anyway for the serious who want to avoid chink scams and internal bickering this is a solid project - maybe more of a long term hold.
