Really wanted to invest in some power ledger and now I can’t because how shit CoinBase is, now I’m missing out on fat gains.>Ordered this shit on 11/18/17 and it’s not going to arrive until the 28th
pssst...litecoin is much faster.
This is just strong hands training, noob.
You'll see.
I have to wait 8-9 days for ethWhich is weird since I bought eth before and it took a couple for a couple of minutes
I plan on holding anyways, too bad BTC and ETH aren’t doing shit.
That's how long bank transfers take for coinbase.
You could bank transfer money (USD) into your coinbase wallet for future buying opportunities.
You know think ahead
