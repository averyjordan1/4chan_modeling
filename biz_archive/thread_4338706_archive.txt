LTC for staying stable during all of this chaos?
yeah
just wait for bcash hardfork later, you'll see the same morons shilling cashing meme, anon never changes
seems like litecoin is better at bcash than bcash
I'm in ltc now.
Seems to have held stable through all the snowstorm.
we wont know until the fork
until the fork + ddos and spamm 0.0001tx on btc network?
bch sure doesn't looks like the king of shitcoins
Can we just be serious for a minute here and agree on one thing?
Rare should either be re-formed as a company, or the licence for whoever owns Conker should be given to Playtonic Games/Team17 since they have already done Yooka-Laylee as a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie.
Conkers Bad Fur day was the best fucking game for that entire decade.
We deserve to have another, well done, sequel.
Fuck playtonic games, jontron did nothing wrong
I have no idea what that even means.
I still haven't played Yooka Laylee, I just know they did it, and have seen the trailers.
Point is Conker deserves a new game.
One with an R-rating that just fucks shit up.
It would be bad-ass and I would play it.
nao Go back to 2009.
