Seems like it could go back to previous highs with this news if people are actually willing to sign up on cryptopia.https://bittox.com/2017/11/23/leaked-hush-coin-listed-bittrex-end-november/Coin seems legit, Bittrex listing should be huge for it since its only on the one small exchange.https://steemit.com/hush/@mreichardt/4cmjec-hush-update-11-10-2017
This coin is severely undervalued because it's stuck on a shit exchange and gets no exposure.If it was on bittrex I think market cap would be atleast 40 million.
Which means if you quickly sign up for cryptopia you could make a handsome 10x.
A bittrex announcement would see this coin making antshares like gains.I'm glad I already had an account from when I bought smartcash.Remember.
Buy the rumor!
