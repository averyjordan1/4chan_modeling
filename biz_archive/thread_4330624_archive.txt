Aaaand Vertcoin is back!
Just bought at 63k.
Feeling comfy
comfy and oh so cozy
you should probably sell soon this pump is barely hanging in there.
itll be back to 63-64 soon
Get out if you bought...
It is way over priced from the mean, it is not sustainable.
I sold at loss right before it went up.
I was not patient enough it seems :)
new hourly candle just opened bullish af we are breaking resistance tonight and maybe ATH overnight.
Ready for the second climb?We going for 80k
