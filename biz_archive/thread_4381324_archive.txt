People are buying their own orders to increase price.
I got a bunch of screenshots.
Feel free to look at the orderbook.
Why would someone buy 15% higher when there's a lot of other low orders?
Here is another one.
They're waiting for something...
it's the new etherdelta scam to fake price increases and lure in normies
The opposite is happening on HST - people buying lower orders in order to deflate the order book.
It works surprisingly well.
There is some shady fucking shit going down with this shit coin.
Im going try to make money off it but will most likely lose it all.
jumped in below .0005, back to .0007 wonder what will happen from here
.0005 is most likely the bottom, would be too much buy pressure below that.
(Btw, wtf do you call the equivalent of a sat in eth?)
