Did some reading up on coins that are sold on binance that barely get any attention on /biz/.
At first glance I rate them like this:These look like shit ways to lose your money:HSR, CTR, MDA, SNGLS, AST, OAX, GXS, CDT, MTHThese look pointless and generic:FUN, ENJ, VIB, ENG, SNTThese look mildly interesting:EOS, EVX, SNM, STORJ, BNTThese look interesting:RDN, DLT, AMB, BQX, YOYOWThis one looks like a winner:TRONOfcourse I could be totally wrong, so I would like to know what /biz/ thinks of these coins.
Someone must know more about any of these shitcoins
bump
I'll hunt you all down
How is FUN pointless?
Maybe I'll buy some, it's just that it seems like an overdone concept.
Then again: I could be totally wrong.
That's why I opened this thread
Can you explain?
What do you mean overdone?
Who else has done state channels?
Because you always end up alone at the end
you convinced me anon, I'll buy some.
Just keep this thread alive, I need to know more about the other coins
I would like to know what /biz/ thinks of these coins.I spent a ridiculous amount of time looking into crypto and I've still never even heard of half of these shitcoins.
I think this a fucking shill for TRON -- which I hadn't heard about until their shitty coins showed up in my wallet today.
Don't invest in foreign shit.
I got airdropped Tron.
Not enough to make minimum transaction.
Will it ever go up high enough or do I need to buy in a little more if I ever want to sell this shit?
I just went through the binance market listingswhy would you think that, anon?
