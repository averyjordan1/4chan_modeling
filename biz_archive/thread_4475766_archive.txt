give it to me straight /biz/.is the alt boom officially over?
will BTC continue it's bull run forever and never correct down to give poorfaggots a chance?is ETH and BTC the only crypto that matters?Real talk only.
Well the enthusiastic normie can keep alts alive, everyone loves a 'next king' or whatever.
But if the big boys don't crush us all I think it's BTC and ETH maybe XRP, shit like LTC they just won't get
Quarter 1 2018 will deliver a new batch of alt boom.
BTC could be 5 figures then, ETH could be $600.
So yes that and Eth are the only ones that matter long term.
ETH

If we make it that far anon... What if CME gets through, what will it do to us?
Disgusting pic.
But no, there are plenty of legitimate companies out there that you can still invest in -- powr, ripple, dash for example.
POWR is done man
BTC can't possibly bull run forever, however it can bull run for a very long time before finally crashing with no chance of recouping.
Unfortunately there is no way to know when that crash will happen.
Play the market at your own risk.
doesn't understand real fundamentals of ETHignorance, or just stupid?
Anon buys ETH high and sells low, >IT MUST BE A PONZI SCHEME!!!
Coinbase is launching a custodian service in early 2018 that will allow institutional investors to buy shitcoins.
I'm hoping that will be the start of a new alt bull market.
