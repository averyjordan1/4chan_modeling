When do I sell my POWR /biz/ will it still be going up up up
we're still within the same length of time it took for it to stablise yesterday, another pump before PBC but make sure to sell a few hours before 5pm EST
Book profits and wait for major correction.
I genuinely don't think there will be much of a correction, it seems to be stabilizing pretty well.
7100 is the floor.
Thanks anon
I did this.
I mean I legit believe in this project but the weekend's crazy gains can't be sustained.I sold at 0.0019000 ETH and I'll buy back in around 0.0016
Before 5pm EST, when it will duuuump
what if it is the pick tho
