Why is LlNK not recovering like the other alts?
Same with REQ
Tell me exactly why you think it should?
There's no reason.
No news, no new exchanges.
Nothing.
I'm holding a ton of it, but I know this isn't some PnD moon mission.
You need to be patient.
Just forget about it.
I can't forget it.
All the linkies are living rent free in my head
just od on something strong and wake up 2 years from now thenotherwise your inmates will be living rent free in your anus
I'm 50% REQ and 30% LINK.My mindset is : these coins are great, I read the whitepaper, I checked the team, I checked partnerships.
These coins are the thrue one.
BTC, ETH had these trend before.
Be stronger than these charts.
I keep 20% to "trade" ETH / BTC / altshit
whales are accumulatingthis is going to go interestellar when a partnership is officially anouncedwe might have to wait months for it to happen thoughholding 4k here
because there are like 20 other oracle coins now and link only has 2 shitty devs
Name 1
you mean aeternity?Link has the first mover thing and the fact that bankers already know about it, why would they trust a copycat?from their site (that looks like every other gimme your money coin site) I wouldn't trust them with my money
