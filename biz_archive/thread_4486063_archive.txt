>just in time for the tether shitshow
Is it out?
Holy shit.
ETH will moon like a fuckmaster once it does.
Not out but will be in december.
Watch the guys talk from devcon, this is big.
I'm not buying make doe, just happy that they're solving the fiat problem.
I have a few MKR’s but really, the big deal with it is the decentralized leverage mechanism created by the ability to use DAI to buy more ETH, collateralize that and make more DAI to buy more ETH, and so on, with a 1% annual fee?
Wow.
That’s big for crypto overall.
This will moon so hard, gonna buy 100k.
