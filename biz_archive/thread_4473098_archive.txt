If all bitcoin was created from mining blockchains and all blockchains were created by transactions, then how was the first block created or mined?
I cant remember exactly but Satoshi had to do some custom code for the first block to push it through so things would kick off.
We dont call it the genesis block for no reasons.
Obviously it need a kickstart you moronic pajeet.
If all transactions are public why do you need to solve the hash problem?
