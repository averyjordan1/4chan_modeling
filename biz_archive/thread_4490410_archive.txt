Is today just a shitty day for crypto?
Is that why nothing is moving really?
don't worry - shits about to either blow the fuck up or completely self destruct

pretty good day for me daytrading xmr and bch
bitcoin hit an all time high twice in the past 24 hours.
market is great if you aren't still trying to play the lottery with shitcoins.
it isn't august anymore guys.
it'll either blowup, or blow upi hope we all make it
This.
People either are ok because Tether contained the issue and have more faith in it, or they are worried its completely solvent and was propping up the price of bitcoin.We are about to see a moon mission, or a ton of suicides as BTC goes down to $200
GVT master race making bank
Can you hear it?
The deafening silence..
The 2 big dumps of 2000 btc in a minute in 2 days Its the calm before the storm.
Exit all crypto markets now.
Bitfinex is going under.
You have been warned.
I dont use bitfinex tho
I have money in Bitcoin but I would literally sell my soul to Satan to see it go down to $200.
Imagine the number of lives absolutely fucking ruined.
People would actually commit mass suicide.
It would be glorious.
which is why itll never happen
i don't think it will ever be under 7k again
