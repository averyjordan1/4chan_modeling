Bad news: you probably won't make it.

Tap the three dots in the top right and select "Show Percent Holdings"

Comfy.
Why no eth?
odn, cnd and rlcdo you literally fall for every shilled pajeetcoin?
?RIP

Sold all 76 eth yesterday, expecting the "news" to cover the parity issue as a hack.
Also, I need no eth in order to hedge against btc potentially self destroying as I have 0.4 btc on bitmex ready to short wit a x25 leverage to cover any losses.
I see.

How much is your LINK worth now friend?
+50% feels good man.

Why the fuck do you Europeans use commas and periods in the wrong places?
I've been holding since August I am ready
Sell those USD.
Worthless.

They're actually in the Bitconnect loan so I chose to log them like that
