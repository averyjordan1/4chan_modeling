Should I get REQ or LINK???
REQ, without a doubt.
Slight dip yesterday then it's going way up again today.
Req
REQ is a mental masturbation with crypto.They're pushing their partnership with LINK to make them seem like they're a great investment and hold etc.Meanwhile LINK dgaf because they know they own this playground, as fortune 500 company partnerships give them the reassurance they dont have to appeal to anyone.If you can explain the usefulness AND financial benefit of REQ without using the stupid "Paypal of crypto" line, go for it.
If you're in it for the pump and dagf, go LINK.I do hold both though as REQ hasnt had its day yet, despite me thinking its fucking pointless
% REQ , 25% LINK,
