So is Tether a secure coin to park my BTC?, I keep hearing people call this a scam.
literally nothing wrong with it
no point in moving BTC
4438584Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.
So 1 USDâ‚® is always equivalent to 1 USD.You'll be just fine.
:)
So if I trade $50 worth of Bitcoin to Tether and then Bitcoin dips, I'll still have $50 of Tether?
you park in btc by owning btc
That's a fucking lie though, it says it in the terms and conditions that it's not backed up by anything
Theoretically until Tether decides not to pay you for the tokens in USD.
But yeah many people park their crypto in tether to be "safe"
They are perfectly safe.
Bitfinex most certainly gets a client wanting to buy 30 million dollars worth of cryptos everyday near the ath.
There's nothing fishy about that.
tether is not for long term holding.
it's for short term hedging.
I have no interest in USD, I'd only be transferring back and forth between Tether and other coins.
Put it in ethereum if you want to be safe.
Tether is not safe.
I assure you, financial authorites are investigating bitfinex right now.
Their partner bank wells fargo got the fuck away from that partnership for good reasons.
Yeah but if Tether announces they're not honoring tether to USD at 1:1 anymore then the value of your tether to any other coin will plummet.
The trust will be gone.
They already don't holy shitThey say SPECIFICALLY on their site that you cannot ask for dollars with tether.
It is all trust
Until synth cdo's fuck the us market again kek
