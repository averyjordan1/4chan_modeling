Whys this shit tanking hard
People are hoarding too much Literally everyone on /biz/ has 30k+ I've seen some anon mention having 500k+ from presale If its such a sure thing then it will constantly sinking
Just some retard thinking 170 k links is a wall :))Watch me eat it up after 2 confirmations
HOLY frigging shit AAAAAAA AAAAAAA
Linkies are weakhanded faggots that's why.
Half of 4chan is a linkie lmao
people selling for bitcoin so they can get justed on the dip
That's what happens to a coin without any news, communication or a finished product.
Plus Bitcoin is mooning.
because it is shilled hard with no news...
These memes are too funny
Good meme but shit coin.
Good luck with this, pajets
Alright guys, I'm a complete pleb in this, but I've heard it's a good time to invest in this.What exactly makes this so special again?Mind you, I have no experience with cryptos other than what I hear about Bitcoin or whatever.
because bitcoin is being tether pumped againeverything is down
Bitcoin is rising to new highs>Alts are falling down>The moment BTC stabilizes we will see a pump in various ALt in most cases most of themThe never ending circle
what makes it so special is it only goes down, never up
so we can buy more!
Sooooo I should wait for it to go even lower so I can buy more is what you're saying.
I don't think you know what weakhanded implies...
2 fucking confirmations left boys, stay @2060
thinks btc is fake pumped>yet at the same time thinks alts naturally go up 300% a day because a website launchedlol
This.
If this isn’t obvious to anyone yet, you haven’t been paying attention
If this goes to 0.15 or below i'm gobbling it up
Yep.
It's a great time for new cash to come in on alts.
If bitcoin dips then they will be even cheaper for new cash entries.
NOOOOOOOO
Thanks for the notice OP!Just picked up my cheapest LINK to date!
I'm thinking of investing $1,000 into it (poorfag that's all I wanna give up atm)Good idea for a first investment?
It's not tanking, that's just god giving you a cheaper opportunity to be rich
For reference, I put in 55K USD @ average of .40, so if you can get in at this price, I would say yes.
Jesus Christ, no.
If you don't need the $1000, then sure.
Keep in mind it will be months or even years before you see a return on this.
I've been chipping awat at LINK, dropping $100 or so every time it drops below a certain threshold.
4398242how would this make the price go down you RETARDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
lmaoLINKies BTFOHilarious
FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK FUCK LINK
I told all of you, LINK is mathematically 40 million overvalued.
You are going to get destroyed.
billion coins million in circulation million owned by developer ready to dump>raised over 100 million dollars for "development", has no developers>no blockchain>no company>github has 1 pajeet who stopped sending commits in June>fake SWIFT "partnership">ceo has philosophy degree
Cool, sounds good.Ok, explain to me why.Yeah, that's the perspective I have towards this.
Long term investment not short term.
Also, I really am not doing anything other wise with this other than having it sit in the bank, might as well make it useful.
Everyone is selling their link to buy Cindicator
fucking kek, i nearly spat out my expensive champagne u cunt
OP, you could not say that about Chancoin.#4CHNallday
hahahahahaha
Just throw the money on a fire, it will be more fun.
2 options you have now:1.
YOu are holding ALTSDont sell with loss just wait for the inevitable BTC stagnation your alts will rise again2.
if you hold BTVSell it with profit and invest into ALts that will rise after BTC stagnates
explain this, linkies
explain this linkesmarket cap $58,007,600 with 350 million coins= $0.16say it goes up 20 times today valuemarket cap = $58,007,600 *20=$1160152000Sergei needs more Lambos and prostitues and release all the other coins.price now = $1160152000 /1billion coins= $1.1kek you never going to reach even $1 because sergei will start dropping coins every time it rises.good luck with Lambo, you will be lucky to get second hand bicycle and a meal at mcdonalds.prove me wrong.Sergei releases the other coins into market so he can buy more lambos
alright I'm a linkie now, feels kinda good
You know I'm actually investing with this in mind, like the worst case scenario is that I make 5 times my return?Oh no, I'm still making money how awful.
mil+550mil is only 900 mil...
>see link at 49k>OH SHIT TIME TO BUY>by the time my deposits go through it's at 51kFOR FUCKS SAKE
Invest only in time-tested coins as the Diamond (DMD) https://bit.diamonds/
That's what sucks about not being able to keep money in the exchanges.
not worried one bityou newfags are really somethin' else.
who cares about some short term dippin'.
you should have some money on sidelines to take advantage of this kinda stuff.
amateurs.
all I know is we got a real winner here.
DON'T MESS THIS UP.
I need me my looooooong vacation.
WHY WONT IT FUCKING STOP!?
is this going to gain 10% again tomorrow?
is this an easy day-trade?so fucking tempting
I just wish people would STOP FUCKING SELLING
Jesus christ, it's reached terminal velocity.
You can lose everything or lose half of everything.
You need to decide RIGHT NOW.
you'll never get my LINKs.
I'm finally down 1 cent on link, feels bad man
Because it's garbage, Anon.Big boys are buying XRP and NEM.
Sold my btc I bought at 6509 for link just now.
Average buy price is now 0,21.
Let's hope this pays off.
