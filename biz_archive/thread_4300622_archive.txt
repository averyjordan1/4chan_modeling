>put all my shit into BCH back in September because it was legitimately useful for actual transactions >price kept falling>sold it all and went back to BTC a few weeks ago
Same my dude, same.>bought at 0.08 for the initial moon>went all in at .12>hold, make money>hold, BCC bleeds out for months>finally sell at 0.05, enormous loss, thinking this shitcoin wont be relevant again since there will be a fuckton more forks and there was no interest>starts spiking like a week after I sellI had like 6.88 BCC and if I held months ago I would have been at 5x my total now.
Fml
In the meantime I have learned my lesson: almost every time I have ever sold at a loss it has retraced to its old price (except fucking bancor lol).
BCC was the second exception, which has now done it
bought 12 bch at 330>spent all of it on antminers the same day
