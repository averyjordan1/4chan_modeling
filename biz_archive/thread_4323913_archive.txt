do you know why Bitcoin will remain king?
because there are people who hold bitcoin and only bitcoin, they don't trade or anything, just normal people old people they buy bitcoin and hold it and hardly look at the market.
There's so many people that do this, they just invest into bitcoin and call it a day.
So if bitcoin cash was ever to win over bitcoin then it will be over for crypto, so many people, old people are going to get burned.
This is the reason why bitcoin will remain where it is.
Next month you'll all just run onto the next hype coins and forget about this just like previous months.
