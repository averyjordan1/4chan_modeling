I don't understand why people are saying it's SLR.
In the MIT paper people are pushing around (dci.mit.edu/assets/papers/15.998_solar.pdf) they clearly state that Solarcoin is just one of the existing solar blockchain models.
In fact, they explicitly state- "The energy team has met with the CEO and CFO of LO3 to discuss synergies and partnership potential.
"LO3 has been working on the Brookyln Microgrid and Transactive Grid project, using blockchain technology to create a community-powered microgrid.
This includes both traditional sources of energy and local energy resources (i.e.
solar energy).
The energy derivatives trader is clearly Bill Collins, co-founder of the LO3 team.
"Bill is a finance professional with decades of experience in investment banking, structured finance, and environmental markets.
For seven years, Bill led a team at EcoSecurities tasked with sales, trading and risk management of the largest private sector carbon project portfolio" as found on Bill's portfolio.
Transactive Grid Project is also led by the Consensys team, as you can see from https://consensys.net/ventures/partnerships/.
It is a tested innovation, installed in Brooklyn, New York, to show that energy grids can be effectively translated to the blockchain.
Grid+ is the prized blockchain project under the Consensys team that has evolved from the TransactiveGrid project.
Now I bring your attention to the Grid+ whitepaper.
"The first project began in May of 2015, which was a ConsenSys-led joint venture to construct the TransactiveGrid.
Championed by ConsenSys Enterprise partner John Lilic and seniortechnologist Dr. Christian Lundkvisk, the TransactiveGrid proved that electrical energy could be tokenized on Ethereum and transacted across a distributed network.
"It only makes sense that Teeka is willing to give hints it was in ICO sale at that time.
Grid+ now trades for higher than ICO pre-sale price, albeit slightly lower than ICO price.
