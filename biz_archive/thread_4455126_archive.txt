FUD me on LINKSeems like a cool project and not a typical shitcoin but bagholder arguments seem very optimistic.LINK isn't meant to be cash or a store of value and value is meant to come from "fees on tokens" for some revolutionary ecosystem that doesn't exist yet?
Accumulating is encouraged by gaining more trust for your node, which seems 100x better than all the "ids used for feed :DDD" shitcoins.

Do you understand it on a technical level?

"Smart Contracts" is the biggest offender.
Nobody can explain it besides "b-banks will use it" and "i-it's revolutionary".
LINK is going down the drain like it deserves.
Do YOU understand it?
All I hear from bagholders is "smart contracts" and "SWIFT".
Yet nothing has happened in the month it's been shilled here.
