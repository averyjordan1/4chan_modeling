Lost around .5 btc ; (not from shit trades) for some reason I set up my stuff through my school email.
Long story short I Sold my 2006 bmw 330i for my btc and "shitcoins" made some gains and then Someone hacked my online math, Like I go to a local highschool but I got so far ahead I do homebound now at my pace.
Anyways I have a admin and someone sent my admin a butthole spread I mean tore apart.
Saying your my love from past life, I just want one passionate fuck.
Bro the cops and my principal came to my house I freaked out and said I got doxed or hacked to check the ip but I haven't heard from them in days and they haven't unlocked my stuff and binance wont let me log on.What really makes me mad is I got pushed in a pool, I know i'm fucked any way it goes bc I broke my phone and it had my google auth 2fa.
I'm so stupid I didn't write it down I only screen shot it on my phone.
Guys I know that not a lot of money, but I'm only 18 grew up poor af hustle every day, I work manual labor 50 hours a week.
I'm so mad.
I'll be hanging from the tree in the park if you need me.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Appart from the fact that it's gibberish writing, don't do anything stupid anon, you're 18, you have time.
Anon, you're only 18.
You still have time, even just investing in crypto right now means you're gonna make it.
Rip that e90.
that's really sus of your school to fuck your email over sketicism/speculation without proof.
should sue them saying you lost 30 bitcoins u had.
Sorry OP but I'm also working manual labour.
5k is nothing in the long run.
invest in long term, high growth potential coins, 10 or so you feel are not shitcoins.
You will make it.
Just bought 100keks
Retard check iCloud if your photos are backed up.
If so u might be able to get it back.
I recommend putting stuff on iCloud notes
