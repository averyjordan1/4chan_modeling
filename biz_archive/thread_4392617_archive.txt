WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF ALTCOINS IF THEY GET REKT BY BTC ALL THE TIME?WHY CANT IT BE LIKE APRIL-JUNE AGAIN WWHHHHHYYYY ENOUGHHHH
if you haven't realised it yet the shitcoin bubble is over.
Investing in anything other than pump of the day (and then selling when you're in profit) or coins outside the top 10/20 is suicide.
deluded faggot who cant conceive of anything beyond a month time frame
Everyone keeps telling you to accumulate bitcoin and HODL you stupid nigger.
The fuck you doin with that weak hand bullshit?
I agree to a certain degree, we won't see x20s like DGB, RDD anymore but there are still good projects out there to invest in.
It's just you have to keep most of your portfolio in BTC now which sucks.any normie can buy BTC, hold and make gain where the fuck is the fun in that?
Bitcoin surges> alts crashBitcoin crashes> alts crash

while you're sitting on biz shitposting about your $100 invested in links going to 0, I'm making actual money trading btc.
Then again, I'm not a poor nigger like you, your only chance of making it is praying that whatever shitcoin you invested in gets a huge pump and moons.
we won't see x20s like DGB, RDD anymoreYes we will.
But not based on speculation like before.
Now it will be based on actual useful services launching that use those tokens as utilities on their platforms.
The point is not holding them when BTC rallies.
Or hold and ignore them until you sell with a profit.
If you look at them every 5 minutes when BTC rallies obviously your anus is holocausted.
Fuck you, already swingtraded Link today and made 500 Link out of nothing.
right?
The fun is not getting assblasted and raped sideways by PnD bullshit.
Kill the shitcoinsKill them all
Until there's no blood left to spillBy divine right, Hail and Kill
your anus is holocaustedThank you anon, thank you so much.
I haven't laughed like this for a very long time.
We will.
But defo not on DGB or RDD .
