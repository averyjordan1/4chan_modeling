Aeron, a blockchain for aviation safety, was just added to Binance a few days ago.
It's a brand new project.Naturally, it dumped from 80 cents to 50 or so cents when it came on the market, but has since stabilized.
The volume is huge and it looks like this is the bottom.
Market cap is tiny, only 6 million.
It's currently sitting at ICO price which was 50 cents.
Seems like a no-brainer.
Just put one ETH into it as a calculated risk.
Expected some nice returns.
No reason this can't hit a market cap of at least 30 million.
the fuck does it do
Creates a ledger of air traffic control and pilot log aimed at preventing human error (which is the majority of airline accidents).
They are working with a aviation flight school in Cyprus as of now.
BumpJust put my money where my mouth and bought more because I'm convinced.
