AAAAAAA MOMMY BITCOIN WILL GO UP RIGHT MOMMY?
Just close the charts m8 no point in torturing yourself.
Give it to me straight /biz/.
It's over, isn't it?
It's up this month
Yes, bitcoin has been mooning for the last few days and it will continue to do so.
Wow 21 whole bitcoins!
Let me just put that on the refrigerator where everyone can see it, sweety.
>dear, I'm worried.
Baby seems obsessed with Bitcoin still, doesn't he understand BCH is the future?
It sits right at its support.
If it breaks it it's sayonara.
That's bullshit.
This isn't normal fluctuation.
It's lost significant ground to Bitcoin Cash.
This time is different.
If a flippening occurs, legacy Bitcoin might not exist for long, along with ANY price.
The exact same thing happened in September, just BTC was cheaper back then.
This time is different.You can practically hear the woes and cries echoing throughout the span of time and ages of every single gambler.
