Bought a few days ago.
Biz is ignoring it.
Everyone here hates money
I'm long/bullish, I can see it 50-100 mil mkt cap by the end of the year.
I don't trust slav coin, but I might buy but it in few weeks/months when the price will be halved, at least.
Not buying 'slav coin' is like not buying Alibaba or Tencent.
there are plenty of smart Russian and eastern europeans.
Most winners of Kaggle competitions are from there.
I bought a few after seeing this being shilled and some actual potential.
When does this shit start pumping
The moment people start noticing it, volume will go up, then price will go up fast (look at sell order book, it's thin) and people will FOMO.It hasn't happened already because almost no one is shilling it.
One of my comfiest holds, it will 5x quickly when people shill and others notice it, and has potential for 50-100x long term.
Insanely efficient team, I love this shitcoin.
thanks...filled my bags!
