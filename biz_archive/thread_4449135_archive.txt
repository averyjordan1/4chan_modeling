Why so much evil in this world?...
Is there really a God?
There's 2 Gods:1.
The Demiurge.
He trapped our souls in this snowglobe of a prison called earth and gave us bodies of mud.
The Demiurge is not perfect, and thats why we are not perfect and full of evil.
Some people around you are pure mud bodies with no soul, and these are the truly evil ones.2.
The good news that Jesus brought is that there is a God above the Demiurge who made the Demiurge.
When you die, if you do have a soul, your soul is free from this mud body and you return to the loving arms of the true God, where the Demiurge got his souls from for this prison.
god is just a humanity's imagination.
Unironically this.It's luciferians, and freemasons (gentiles that practice jewish mysticism) they want to live forever and be trapped on this planet
This is not business or finance related.
Go back to Tumblr you deluded faggot.
Kill yourself tonight.
Yellen is the cause of inequality if this is what you mean by your fgt post.
The upper middle class rigged the system to serve themselves first.
Nothing is random, it's all God.
Check out TempleOS to talk to God.
There is a God and he loves you.
Jesus came to save us all from the evil all around AND within us.
Check out Bible Gateway and don't hang out here too much.
Start with New Testament maybe John's Gospel.
Best wishes anon
Sure.
The world around you is a part of god and so are you.
Time and space doesnt exist for god so he is everything that was, is and will be at once.
