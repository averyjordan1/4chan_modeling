Could MetaMask or Electrum ever get hacked like the Parity multisig wallets did?
Fantastic question.
That is what everyone is afraid of.
Partly.
The thing with the Parity bug is you cannot escape it.
All wallets got irrevocably (barring HF) nuked.With electrum, I believe you are also trusting a third party, but if it goes rogue, you’ll know soon enough, and if you haven’t touched your wallet in a while, nothing will have happened to it.
It cannot be remote-nuked when it’s not running.
Because it’s not on the blockchain.
I'm not sure but don't have anything in Binance tomorrow
The code of the contract was the problem.
MetaMask and Electrum aren't smart contracts.
W-why?
4262027I'm also curious
Bullshit.
Anti NULS coin shills are out in force.
Does parity not allow to export private keys?Couldn't you export and import to another wallet?Is this why exodus is safer?Hmmmmmm.
Vert on Exodus when?
