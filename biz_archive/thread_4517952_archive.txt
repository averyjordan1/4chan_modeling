h-how much is he going to accumulate?https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin%20cash/address/19hZx234vNtLazfx5J2bxHsiWEmeYE8a7k
That's Rodger Ver
All of it.
The wallet is a JPM insider who is accumulating BCH and acting as counterparty to the bank's off-balance sheet toxic debt.The idea is that, once he has accumulated BCH it will crash to zero and, at that point, the counterparty sub prime debt is effectively wiped clean, because it is being paid off in worthless altcoin.Pretty clever scam if you ask me.
But BCH has been an incepscam since day one, anyway.
lol what.. proof?
