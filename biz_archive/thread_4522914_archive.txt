you know im right.
if youve been here for awhile youve been a victim of /biz/ youve lost moneyfor the most part /biz/ is a failure at investingprove me wrongprotip; you literally cant
literally like 4 coins /biz/ ever shilled has gone upETHWAVESPIVX BITBEANNothing else /biz/ has been positive toward has appreciated significantly (except deluded ARKies)
/biz/ hates on things that are actually promising and/or being shilled by reddit, too.The amount of good coins these 12yo fags fud is insane
/biz/ is baseline reactionary.
Every poster is either>a reactionary who is yelling to BUY BUY when something has already gone up>a coin loyalist who are shills who do it for free
i was here saying POWR will go up.
Look at the coin, the team the contract they did.It went up, many didnt follow.Now i tell you, its gonna up again, if you look at the chart you see clearly that everybody is hodling because its gonna reach 2$ at least in  short terms.But yeah, keep on trading on shitcoins, expecting some small profit but losing all your money.
Pajeets
save it.
it works and educate other biztardsthere is even logic to it, when a coin is mooning everyone is shilling to buy, while you should sell when everyone else is buying.
They will dump their coins soon enough, especially in crypto
I missed the NULS mission
Do you have Down Syndrome?I see shitcoins being shilled all day that only drop in price.
ive shilled SUB for months.
made 5x returns.
the problem in /biz/ is no one wants to do research and good coins get ignored for the ones with the most memes.
this seems to be the current state of affairs with LINKies
It's because 99% of biz users are retards or noob traders and still have the get rich quick mentality.
But with time you learn to distinguish the good posts from the retards.
The good posts are getting pretty rare these days though.
