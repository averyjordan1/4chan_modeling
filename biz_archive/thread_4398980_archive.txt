So I heard BITB was pumping so I decided to hop on and lost some bags :/ Not that big of deal in the grand scheme of things but im looking to recover.
I heard OMG was a really good pick but its slow right now.
Any sugestions for somthing to hop on.
I saw alot of you guys shiling Gup, Factom, and LSK.
I think Factom has the most potential out of these groups with the chinese loving it and what not.
Apprently this is a legit coin and its been having pretty organic growth.
What you think /biz/?
I think Im going to go into FCT (Factom) because it seems like the real deal and not just a quick buck.
I will be holding until at least $25 at the current growth trends.
Maybe go higher?
FCT looks primed....only thing on bittrex first page in the green.
Hmmm....might have to sell powr at a loss and hop in.
I like FCT
I heard OMG was a really good pick but its slow right nowI haven't even bought omg but can you see how fucking retarded this logic is?Why are you looking to buy gains?
Buy when it's "slow" so youre on the ground floor.

Great point, Will buy some OMG to hold.
All my money in FCT
