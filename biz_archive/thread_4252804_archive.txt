who here /sidelines/ right now with all their cash plotting their next move?
I don't sideline.
I traded my BTC into ETH after the pump today.
I like to treat ETH like bonds when the market is insecure.
It's way more predictable in a way that allows me to buy and sell multiple times a day for gains while I wait everything out.
When BTC balances out I switch back in because I expect another pump at that point.
Yup.
Sold my BTC within minutes of the news and holding the fiat for now.
Got a shitload of altbags already filled anyway so in no rush to buy more without planning properly.
