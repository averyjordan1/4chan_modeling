who here /comfy/ with the cat ?
Been holding since ICO, been too lazy to sell so I will see what happens
Bought at 2.5 USD and kept buying on the way down so my average entry point is about a dollar.
I am still embarrassed that I was foolish enough to buy this obvious pump and dump, but I did see a potential in the long term so I kept hodling.
There is hope, the owner hasn't totally abandoned it either and they are working on something, it will probably be pumped and dumped many times again.
with a slick logo like that bittrex will soon pick it up for the chinese population
Yeah, there is activity in the blockcat discord group every day and it's encouraging that it's not just "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH MY MONEY".
I would have just dumped yesterday but I expect that there will be some serious pumps in the next 6 months.
no way.
Eric hangs out in the slack channel an hour every day.
Also they hired more people and they will be introduced tomorrow, thats why i am /comfy/ here
