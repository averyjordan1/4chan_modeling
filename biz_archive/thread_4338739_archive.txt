Discovered im 53% European Jewish over the weekend, guess that explains all my gains, so, whats looking up this week?
Yeah, I mean I'm a new investor and seems like it's a bit late to hop on the American market wagon since it's so high, so was looking for ones that had a lower P/E ratio.
I feel like right now to jump into America is risky.
Fuck off David.UVXY muh nigga.
Emerging markets, mining sectors, and energy sectors are like the 3 things that are actually growing at a slower rate this year than everything else.
I'd buy them right now.
When the other over inflated sectors pull back a bit these sectors will probably even see modest gains.

I'm trying to learn how to make a portfolio that would do well in a downturn.
I feel like this has to run out of steam soon.Crypto is extremely risky and I feel like my regular portfolio needs to be very conservative.

Brazilian elections 2018 is 100% going to be a shitfest.
there's not one decent candidate lined up yet.
it's hillary trump all over again.
you've got until march '18 to make up your mind before the polls start rolling.
chances are the next president will not suck as much as expected and we will see some decent recovery over the year.
there's also a couple of bills doing well in congress that should further cuck wageslaves and make businesses more profitable, and the usd-brl is higher than usual right now.
which memes should I buy with earnings reports this week
