Snowden promoted ZEC.

Do your own search.
It will take you a day and then you will realise what is true and what is not.In my opinion you should read this: https://moneroforcash.com/monero-vs-dash-vs-zcash-vs-bitcoinmixers.phpTHAT BEING SAID: Zcash IS NOT A PRIVATE ANNONYMOUS CURRECNY AS IT HAS A TRANSPARENT BLOCKCHAIN ffs and is not decentralised..
I have, 80% of my holdings for true comfy feelings.
$ per coin no thanks pal.
zcash is the way.team is some of the best cryptographers in the world.
the only cryptographers in the blockchain space, aside from the Verge team.
Zcash allows governments to work with cryptographers to eliminate illegal activity.
The only reason you would ever want monero is if you were looking for ransom, extortion, or other illegal activity.
Zcash gives user privacy from other users but can still be tracked in extreme cases.
in terms of a long term investment, one seem much more likely of adoption and Monero will mainly be used by traders or for illegal activity
I don't know with ZEC but with ZEN (zencash) you have multiples addresses.
Privates and transparent.
So, please stop spreading FUD
Don't have any liquidity to throw at it
