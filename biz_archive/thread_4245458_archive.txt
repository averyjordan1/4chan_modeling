How easy is it to make your own altcoin?I mean couldn't you just make a random shitcoin that sounds promising, keep 50% of the initial coins, wait for people to buy your coin "just in case it's the next BTC" and then you sell your coins and disappear?
yes, you've just described most ICOs
Pretty easy, all you have to do is copypaste dogecoin's source, maybe insert a tor client into it, and come up with a catchy name for some nonexistent upcoming feature, for example "wraith protocol".Then just keep delaying the release until you can dump all your initial coins.
Any similarities with existing coin is purely coincidental lol
for example "wraith protocol".Thanks dude.You'll be hearing about the wraith protocol next week.
It lets blockchains move past one another without any delay or effect on the other blockchains.You'll probably be investing in it too.
This perverse idea of crypto currency.
Did you know that there are coins that are on the market in 2013?
For example, Diamond (DMD) bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=580725.0
next weekFunny, I thought it was supposed to be released yesterday.I'll pass.

I've seen it happen a few times with shitcoins shilled on /biz/Most recently a shitcoin called Sojourn, although that wasn't really shilled, and Minereum has an element of it too.
