Ok, listen up anons.
Time to start buying cheap crap on topia.
This is how I x1000'd my money over last spring and if you listen, you will too.
Cheap coins are just so easy to pump, nearly every single one will x20 over the shitcoin season.
Buy BNX Q2C CPN TEK CAPS SFC EMD and so many others.
Guaranteed profits.
Instead of chasing the tail end of hype, you can buy on the ground floor and watch everyone else fuck up for a change.
dgb will pump next yeary probalbaly
