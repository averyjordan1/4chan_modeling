BUY THE DIP
Don't listen to people blindly.
After every bull run comes the bear trap comes the bull trap comes the bear trap etcIt's too early to tell the trend now.
Never go all in with everything.
Hodl till profit and sell of profits and buy all the dips.
It's that simple.
Don't follow the market, do the opposite of the market
BUY HIGH SELL LOW
I thought we reached the dip 13 hours ago, that why i bought in.
But guess what?
It dipped very, very hard.
Fuck me.
This has to be bad luck or karma or something else.
Its not like i except my mony to double or 3x.
All i ever wanted was a few hundred bucks to fugg prostis and get high.
Please tell me how to recognize a dip?
This is the fucking "buy low sell high" meme that makes me angry.
Of course its true and so easy to recognize afterwards but while you at it will fucking rape you>"Oh this seems to be the dip, let me buy some real quick, it wont go any low--- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA">"This has to be the peak, it wont go any high-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAA" >Continue till the end of timeI started with 660$ a week ago and i have know 690$.
Come on, just let me get my 1k and im happy.
Don't worry, playing it safe will give you longer legs than risking it all because people at /biz/ screamed at you to buy back.You'll be OK.
just have some patience, follow your take profit and stop loss and dont change your mind midgame
You can't tell the peak of a pump or the bottom of a dip.
You just have to guess.
My rule is that when I go into a new coin I buy it for 500 bucks (It's an amount I'm comfortable to lose without caring).
No more.
Then I see how it goes.
Say it goes up 20% and is now at 600 and see the growth slowing down.
I sell off half and save my gains.
Now it dips 10% and I'm down to 270.
I fill up to 500 and wait again.
My gains right now are 70.
If I hadn't sold my gains would be 40.Now if it dips 10% again I refill to 500 again, so I put in 50 more and I'm still at gain with 20.
Hadn't I done that I'd be at loss already but this way I can comfortably hold.
I'm kinda crippling my gains should I not catch the top, but the trick is to not be greedy.
Also sometimes I choose to buy into dips more depending on how confident I am it will shoot up again (Hint they always shoot up again even shit like Link and DGB)
$made literally that in euros in a day with the whole bch crap.
wagecucks eternally btfo
yeah, this is pretty much what i do too.
i also pay attention to the rsi because it's surprisingly accurate on most coins.
bch's rsi is tipping lower than 20 right now and it's oversold.
i've already filled up my bags and waiting for that 0.24-0.25 again.
use this information as you see fit.
