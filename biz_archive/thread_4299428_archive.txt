Ok guys, if the flippening really happens, what will all the exchanges do?
Just switch from USD/BTC to USD/BCH pairs?All altcoins are measured and traded in BTC, a switch to BCH would cause a huge amount of work, wouldn't it?Also what about all the institutional money involved, I mean the CME group announced BTC futures, they obviously prepared a lot of shit for that, will they also just switch?
nothing because it wont happen
BCH is going to fall hard and BTC will proceed new ATH by mid week.
You're nuts if you think a "flippening" will happen.
Where do these faggots come from?
BCH trading pairs will be added and that's it.Bittrex did similiar thing with ETH.
