Fucking idiots.
(they) have convinced you that the way to riches in crypto is to desperately gamble on bitmex futures at 100x or to buy and "hodl" coins that have already mooned like OMG or LTC.
No.
The way to get rich in crypto is to buy coins before the masses hear about them.
And I'm not talking about buying them before normies hear, like Bitcoin.
I mean before /biz/ and the discord trading group ecosystem hears.
Buy a coin before it is listed on CMC, when its marketcap is  million.
THAT is how you make money.The exact retards posting pink wojacks about confido and vertcoin and powerledger who were posting them about OmiseGo two months ago and ZRX a month before that are gonna be tearing their eyes out over Oligarch(rule).
This is a groundbreaking idea.
Machine learning and privacy is incredibly relevant to our world and this coin is unheard of right now.
Get in before the jews for once, jesus christ.
Some of you make me sick.There's only 30 million of them and the OP hasn't even made an ANN yet.
That doesn't happen until later this week.
Take advantage of this oppurtunity and buy some cheap on ED.
