notice how they didn't include btc in the diagram
そうですか。素晴らしい。
It's because Bitcoin has shit technology.
Literally every single other coin can do more and has a higher transaction rate.
By 2018 median transaction costs will be 20$
Talk about dead on arrival.....
yeah and by 2018 1 bitcoin will be in the neighbourhood of 10k.Paying 20 bucks to send 10k USD anywhere in the world within an hour is still magnitudes better than any wire transfer.
BTC isn't for broke boys anymore

You know what's better?
Paying 10 cents to send 10k USD anywhere in the world within a minute

Too bad the big boys with deep pockets dont give nearly as much of a shit about muh tech as they do muh liquidity.Until your shitcoin gets up to btc-level liquidity, no one cares that it sends transactions moderately faster or cheaper.
