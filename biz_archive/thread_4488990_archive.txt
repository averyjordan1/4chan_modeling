I have $2500 that I want to put into cryptos.
I'm looking at BTC, ETH, XMR, NEO, and POWR.
Any other suggestions or reccomendations?
Also I'm planning on using the Coinbase wallet until I hit ~10k then I'll switch over to a hardware wallet.
yeah, that sounds decent enough for stable gains.powr seems really good.who knows where bitcoin is going though.
shit doesn't stop.
I forgot to say I have no interest in day trading, looking for mid to long term gains.
I'm wagecucking for minimum wage right now but all the cash I can spare will go into crypto
BUY STOX
bitcoin goldit's shit but it's THE shit
Any other suggestions or reccomendations?don't make dumb decisions due to FOMO i.e.
go all in on one thing or panic sell.
and buy your coins in small chunks, though it's already gonna be small chunks becouse 2500$ spread between 5 coins is not much if you are first worlder.
also, spend some time researching other coins before investing even if your picks seem like the best thing ever.
i.e.
RLC and MOD have a lot higher chances to succeed than something as ambitious as POWR, yet are hardly shilled.
LINK cheap great idea for the long run.
And still time to accumulate!
Say it with me biz!
Just
Buy 2k shares of link so you dont feel bad when it blows up
Thank you for posting this cute.
sell your POWR, its going to tank, its just the new hot vaporware erc-20 token of the month, just like chainlink, 0x and DNT wasBTC, ETH and XMR are decent choicesNEO not so much, it really doesn't have much going on for it atmtbqh you should hold one high risk, high reward coins, something with a marketcap below $10M, personally im holding ODN along side my eth bag
it'll probably take you like 3-4 years to 4x your money with those normie cryptos
