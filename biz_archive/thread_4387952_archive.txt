Just bought 10 shares of TSLA.
Is that chill?
lol the most overrated company in the world.
full of debts and overpriced cars.. they lost their gov fundings and they are going to BTFO by other companies like Toyota soon
no thats not chill
Just remember that Musk has already accumulated enough fiat, BTC, whatever else aside from Tesla stock that he is fine if the company Tesla crashes and burns.
When tesla announces that they keep failing onproduction goals, you will get rekt.
Sorry dude, butits the truth.
They keep loosing money as well haha
Lol what an idiot you should buy the crypto that Elon is going to back soon (POWR), that shit will 10x as soon as the announcement is made, good luck with your stocks grandpa
TSLA is the BCH of stocks
A fool and his money are soon departed.

Even elon has stated that TSLA is over bought atm, dunno what the price is atm, but that was a bit over a month ago i believe.
