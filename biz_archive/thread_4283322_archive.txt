Which coin can I buy right now that would generate me more coins for a decent profit daily?
Smartcash for sure.
You get around 12% monthly interest just for not selling
Look at what coins have highest interest rates for lending on poloniex.About coins that generate new coins (by staking) you have to understand that all you usually do is getting a % increase similar to the general inflation of that coin, so theoretically you get nothing much at all.
MNX, at their minexbank you get 6% interest weekly for holding the coins in your wallet, they are not even locked away, but if you spend them you get no interest
Ark.
Get on bittrex, buy it.
Download their wallet and stake it.
If Ark goes to $30 (~10x increase), I'll be making enough to live off of just by holding.
