REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Trying to reassure yourself core shill?
at most btc falls down to 4k or 5k while bch goes up to 3.5k.. then suddenly everyone dumps bch for btc and its all over till the next episode.fact is that nobody gives a fuck about bch except for the people behind it and the bag holders.

Nah I hold both since the fork.
Just think that latest flippening attempt has the most cringeworthy name
>Operation dragonslayerAKA buy the BTC dip.
Institutional investors saw the last attempt at "flippening".
It made BTC dip $1500.
It's going to dip even less this time.
Institutional investors have firmer grips.
It will dip maybe $300-$700 at the most this weekend.
Buy BTC, last chance to sell any BCH.
stfu!
I need to sell my bags

so fucking sell them during dragonslayer at bch ppl's expense.
don't try to rope in more people in your shithole.
