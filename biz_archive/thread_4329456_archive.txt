NAMECOIN JUST OVERTOOK HASHPOWER OF BITCOINITS THE REAL FUCKING BITCOIN
Namecoin is merge-mined you dumb fat fuck.
THE COIN IS AT ALL TIME LOW TOO BIZDONT FUCK UP, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE YOU FUCKING IDIOTS
AND NOW ITS THE MOST SECURE CHAIN ON THIS FUCKING PLANET
The look on everyone's faces when Ethereum surpasses Bitcoin's hashpower and becomes the real Bitcoin is going to be great.
Then Bitcoin is going to become the new Ethereum.
Maybe Monero will become the new Litecoin soon.It's going to become hard soon to keep track of all the name swaps.
We should start calling every crypto by two names, its original name and its current hashpower-place name.
So Ethereum will now be known as "Ethereum Ethereum", and later after it might get more hashpower than Bitcoin (I mean "Bitcoin Bitcoin"), it will be known as "Bitcoin Ethereum", and Bitcoin will be known as "Ethereum Bitcoin".
"Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash" is too long of a name, so I'll just call it "Too Stupid For Segwit Coin".
Watch what happens when the miners choke BTC to death on Monday ;)
the funny thing is some people actually believe if bcash gets more hash power than bitcoin that somehow magically makes it "the real bitcoin"
No h8 m8 but this is the real BITCOIN PLUS
The real bitcoin has awoken.
