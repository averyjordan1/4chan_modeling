Will litecoin surpass it's all time high of 81?
Or will it dip again soon?
How much does the biz believe in ltc?
It's due for a breakout, but depends on whether BTC goes on another bull run or not.
It hit 100 before.
right now too much of LTCs current price is being propped up by margin longs to feel comfy.
the success of bcash threatens litecoin as well.
the success of bcashNot a serious post.
hmm?
do you not see it has $17B cap (and briefly even hit 30B+)?
LTC is still farting around at $3B.
You don't have to like Bcash, but if other people do, it takes away LTC's main selling point vs BTC.
Not at all
the success of bcash>implying its reputation isn't heavily tarnished right nowI don't know if its good technology or not but its going to take a while for the stink to wear off, calling its current state a success is laughable.
I finally swallowed my pride and cashed out a few hours ago losing around half my coins because I realized people were never going to move back into it ever again.
The only reason people even bought that shit was FUD and the failed fork.
Its a worthless shitcoin.
Litecoin is literally satoshis vision
litecoin will soon have smart contracts which will make it moon.
Also, more effort is going into atomic swaps.
The future of litecoin is bright.
Accumulate.
You're welcome.

Purely speculative but it might go up as more people flood into cypto see bitcoin and assume litecoin might do the same.Also has the best brand, recognition after bitcoin.
