This is fine right?
gets noose readyprob a false alarm op
It's 480 NEO (only about $25,000).
Literally nothing.
OP just zoomed in to troll NEO hodlers
Here's my guess for how it'll go.
These are fake walls cause whales are still sccumulating, they know where this will go.
this isnt accumulating, its guaranteeing profits
 I'm a NEO holder
In portrait mode is worst that how it actually is but with no support on buy orders won't go anywhere anytime soon, it might retrace most likely.
Correct to 42 and then back up to 48, correct again to 44 then past 50 by tomorrow morning.
You can sell at 48 and rebuy at 44 if you are fast on the trigger
