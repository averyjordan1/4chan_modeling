No, it isn't.
It will skyrocket in the next few hours.

Fucking pathetic bump.
Are you bitcoiners this deluded?
The fork is over.
Bitcoin = shitcoin.
It's over you idiots.
If by bitcoin you mean bitcoin cash, then yes.
Not really.
People were holding bitcoin to get a reward when the fork happens, just like the last fork.
More and more people will realize that there's no fork and no airdrop... they're gonna sell back into alts.
Which is why so many alts are mooning right now.
Pick your fav alt and buy in.
I choose Ark.
