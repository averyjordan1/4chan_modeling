when you register at an exchange, how safe is it to give your document number/picture?
do they destroy it after verification, can it get into the the wrong hands?
answer me, you fucks.
CEO of Bittrex here.
(We) only use IDs for verification purposes and (destroy) the attached documents and pictures right after the verification is complete.
On its site bittrex says it keeps your info indefinitely but in cold storage.
you gotta give them your info if you wanna play the game
That's not how () work.
cold storageWhat a buzzword.
He is definitely one of (((them)))
So, did you give them your document info too?or use bisq?
Oh shut the fuck up and upload the fucking picture.
Lol bro not even the fucking credit bureaus can keep your shit safe.
The answer is yes your shit is vulnerable when you upload it.
This is an unregulated market.
If you're scared then watch from the sidelines
