Unikoin Gold is an e-sports betting coin that already has a working product (www.unikrn.com).
It got venture capitalist funding, including Mark Cuban, as far back as 2014, which shows how legit these guys are.
(It's estimated to be 25x harder to achieve traditional VC funding then ICO funding).The token sale was undersold.
They raised $30m, half of which was institutional investors.
This led to them releasing 125m tokens, at an average cost of $0.32 per token.
The downside here is that there are a lot of tokens sitting in reserve, but much of it will be sent to cold storage or for betting reserves.Now here's how you can make money: the coin is sitting at $0.20 right now, making the circulating market cap around $25m, which is extremely tiny for such a high profile project.They're releasing on a major exchange within the next 2 days (they said "10 days" from Nov. 5), and with their connections I wouldn't be surprised if it's bittrex caliber.
Binance at the very least.
Also they have major announcements this week, which should bring the hype back.
It's sitting at all-time low, and I doubt it goes any lower, so there's very little risk.https://twitter.com/UnikrnCo/status/929081977470443522

Wow, you're a moron.There are 1 bn UKG.112/1000000~0.000112010 ETH per UKG.0.000881889/0.000112010~7.87 so they hit the exchanges overpriced by 687%.The rest of the tokens (873 MM UKG) gained a magical worth of +769.8 MM USD.This by raising 35.5 MM USD.Because they plan to use those other tokens by dumping them on the market, you know right?73 MM UKG that were not sold are not tied to any whitepaper condition.They will slowly sell them for Cuban's request.More on: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-unikoingold/STAY AWAY
