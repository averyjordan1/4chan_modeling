lots of lending platforms are talked about here, but Bloom is a protocol doing credit scores and can be used by such platforms (like SALT, BCPT, etc.)
and coexist with them.
this is an awesome use-case in light of the equifax hacks recently.if you've seen Bloom talked about frequently here but haven't looked into it, the ICO is coming up so if you want to do some quick research please use my link below to learn more.they're running a referral marketing initiative now that helps you gain position for the whitelist cut-off queue as well as qualify for some giveaways, which is what I'm doing.
