Check it out lads.
I made a Limited edition Pink Wojak that is specially themed for all those who have lost money as long term BTC HODLers.
Enjoy, and remember to repost when relevant!
Haha good one OP stupid BCH hodlrs
BCH hodlersLiterally no such thing.
BCH has been alive for barely three months and has already sufered two pumps and left many of its bag carriers desperate to get out.
Even the whales and token "CEOs" are selling it on the idea of being a disposable, transactional coin whose primary purpose is to exchange for tangibles.Why the fuck would anybody HODL a coin where its creators have built in its own disposability?
lol was is fucking hilarious anon!
