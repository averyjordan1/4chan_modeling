Had to say goodbye to the most loveable cat I've ever had this morning, he was only 22 years young and it was the toughest thing I've ever done.Rest In Peace Hendrix, you will be missed.
Any donations would be greatly appreciated to help me through these difficult times.
Thank you for your generosity.12zJbKAeQDuDVgDHFMc82BvpkmqHzVXmnT
I'd definitely help if I knew 100% you're not a scammer as a cat lover myself.
I attached a copy of the medical bill as proof.
