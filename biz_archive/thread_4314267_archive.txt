So what do you guys think, big alt run when all this BTC/BCH shit is over?
nothe entire market is deadforks ruined everything
4314267This shit is murdering alts bruhs.
Devaluation of BTC is devaluating every alt save for ETH and LTC.
Especially shitcoins.
I don't see why this would kill alts in the future though since a lot of alts trade with ETH
Alts are coming back more resilient and better than ever, especially LINK
diversify between XMR, ETH, & LTC and HODL
Okay, I'm getting absolutely wrecked in alts.
BCH is ass and no infrastructure is built around it, there is no flippening, and it'll probably hang out around 1.5k until the stragglers have exited after the fork.
I'm all in XMR and LTC.
Idiots don't realize that having exchanges collateralized in BTC make it infinitely more valuable than 8tx/block BCH.
Coinbase doesn't use BCH and likely won't ever, alts are all going to pump hard when BCH exit happens.
I'm mainly holding XRP.
The beating isn't too bad.
KNCAMBOMGETH These are my biggest holdings and will give you the best gains once the bitcoin faggots all hang themselves.
It's actually no problem at all for exchanges to add the bch trading pairs.
Most of them are probably already working on it just to be sure.
yes
