Req is just a white paper ico.
They dont have the team or devs to do small token burns on transactions.
There currently is one on larger amounts.
6 ppl team doesnt cut it!
They only have moneytis experience and no actually dev experience with ethereum.
Have you seen their office?
Looks pretty run down.
No one's making moves.
No new exchanges.
Yc has tons of failed startups.
They most.likely paid YC from the pre ICO flip.
They are simply relying on other protocols and platforms.
Coin is still under ico.
Name a coin that was under ico price this long and bounced back higher??
You guys are holding so many bags.
This team in Berlin is similar to that of monetha.
You need actually techs and devs and quite a bit.
6 ppl?
Baggss
6 pplIsn't LINK only like 2-3 people?Any pics of REQ office?
Baggss
This is why i dropped my bags for BlockMason.. nobody should be investing in ICOs that have no product.
Its rare to find a gem at 10m market cap with a team of 10+ and a working product... lets get rich together /biz/
Eh doesn't look terrible for a startup that size.
Pretty common actually.
Frugality isn't a bad thing.
clearly not eating our money away either
YEah and NEO is two fuking people.
This guy is just a sour phaggot spreading FUD bc he sold out
bag holder here.i'm fudding this coin too because it works.
This is too aggressive.
looks like a pretty standard office for a startup to me
Im very comfy with the team and the project, they have a vision and more than sufficient understanding of how they will achieve it.
