Ok, Bitcoin.
Can this fucking shitcoin finally fuck off and not pump every 2 days?Why the fuck are people even buying ATH when there was literally real no recovery for weeks?
It is almost like they just pump BTC every time alts seemingly recover somewhat.
What a shitshow.
I am hearing normies around me talk more and more about buying into BTC.
FOMO is kiciking in hard now.
With hardfork panic gone everyone (including previous crypto owners who were holding back) are pouring in new money.Tether bullshit is just FUD
