Starting to see a lot of NEO posts... I’m convinced that it’s going to moon once btc dumps who else on this rocket with me?!!
You see lot of NEO posts, because holders are starting to be desperate.
Soon, your rocket will be 1 man seat.
Too much buyers remorse over the last 3 months w/ Alts.
/biz/ is a looney bin now.
It's nowhere near as crazy with ETH hodlers in my Discord.
NEO is the only Alt I hold (and do so rather happily but only because I bought in at $5).
Fucking love GAS.
If I was smart I'd probably hedge my BTC w/ BCC but I'm not there yet.If you own enough , you're banking $40+ a week, maybe more.
No stock will do that.
get a load of pajeet phone posting from the shitting street.
