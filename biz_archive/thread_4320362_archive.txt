Made soem decent gains in BCH.

Buy into Alts ETH,Vert ?
Or wait for a BCH dip and hope for the flippening?
ETH will explode after this nonsense.
Eth is next.

BITCOIN GOLD WITH TAKE OVER
ETH until everything calms down.
agree with People are stressed out.
Any non-emotionally attached investor is feeling like a hostage right now.>btc could moon to 8k at any moment>bch could flippen at any moment>if you pick wrong or at the wrong time you bite the dustAt least their prices in satoshi are more or less stable, jesus could you imagine if alts were bleeding too?
i'd have killed myself from sheer stress
bch is the next move lol
If ETH couldn't flip with a huge community, BCH can't flip with all the Korean AstroTurf in the world.
