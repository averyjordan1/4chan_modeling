/biz/ i'm calling for your infinite wisdom.I have very limited knowledge about economics but I have a decent finance background and I'm alright in math and stats.
What intermediate level (under grad or grad level) books would you recommend for a broad vision about macroeconomics?
From schools of thoughts to key variables (growth, inflation, interest rates, unemployment, gouvernement policies...).It would be something to read on my free time so I would be cool if the writing was not too academic.
