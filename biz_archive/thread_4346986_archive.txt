I'm finally doing it, /biz/.
I'm becoming a canadian plumber.
Got an interview tonight for an entry level position with potential for apprenticeship.
I'll check back with you guys in a few weeks with pics of my lambo.
good luck.
Being a plumber is a rather shitty (hehe) paied job here.
Congrats anon!
Not sure how it is in Canada but where I am in the U.S. north east the pay/benefits are great.
