Some shithead weeb bought crap from tcgplayer.com using my debit card last night.
I refuted the charges with my bank, they canceled my card and they're issuing a replacement.
I emailed tcgplayer letting them know the two specific charges were made fraudulently.
They are still pending so hopefully they can be cancelled and I'll just get the replacement card.
What else can I do?
Buy bitcoin
Install Gentoo
