Eth masterrace now.
Who else /comfy/?Keep forking bitcucks
Daily Reminder that ETH forked so they could literally 'undo' a transaction.
Absolute cuckoldry.
Linker here.
Feeling comfy desu.
Gay af.
Vitalik kuckerin should put more effort into making his shitcoin more secure instead of those nonsensical forks.
Daily reminder that if a currency is truly decentralized, it means anyone can fork for any arbitrary reason they want.
It's up to the community to decide whether the fork will carry on or die out.
By complaining about the DAO fork you're basically saying that you're right and a 30b market cap is wrong.
Democracy is the best system of government, how can millions of people be wrong?This is how you sound.
My criticism is valid, the fact there are millions of sell outs willing to be part of a coin where people sell out any and all principles for the sake of mob justice does nothing to counter my criticism.
waaah why won't the free market do what I wantSalty DAO hacker confirmed.
Don't you still have your little personal chain to play with?
Lol you're actually retarded.
I don't care what the free market does, the free market allows for people to pay 8 USD for a cup of starbucks coffee, that's not my problem.
I just gave you my opinion on ETH and why I don't trust it.
You hold ETH and I'll hold BTC and we'll see who comes out in top.
:^)
I hope you're holding BCH in equal amounts to BTC, because it looks like the free market is about to flip "muh store of value" any day now.
