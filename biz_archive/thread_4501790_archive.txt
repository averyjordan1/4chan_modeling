"empowering people financially"Why the fuck aren't you invested anon, do you hate money or something.
Have fun being a poor Virgin neet.
Invested 4 bitbeans.
Have been invested since the start.
Only had $200 to put in but I'm up over 3k.Hoping my wagecuck job will afford me a better position before xmas
I've convinced family and friends to sign up!
It's so much easier than just asking them for money.
Plus at the end of the day, we all get awesome daily compounded ROI!

What this guy said.
At the rate of reduction of payout levels, this ponzi has until the 18th of december, at best.Also all of the Bitconnect assets now belong the the Queen of England.

Fuck off pajeet, go buy some more confido.
As if the queen would run a Ponzi scheme, get real mate.
Is it illegal to profit off of an obvious ponzi scheme so long as you're not one of the crafters and don't promote it to others at all?
2 months from 7/11/11
In the UK 7/11 would be November 7th.
There's been a new filing for Bitconnect, so this document is meaningless.
Even if you promoted it I don't think you would be liable for any charges.
BitConnect is borderline, it really depends on if the trading bot is real or not.
I've gambled with around 11k on this platform in total.
I've earned back my initial investment and keep making more every day.
Could this thing blow up?
Of course and probably.
Do I care?
Absolutely not because I'm a fucking madman.
I'd jump on if it wasn't at the end of the scam.
