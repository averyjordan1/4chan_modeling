When you buy BTC with tether, do you HAVE to sell it back into tether or USDT?
Or can you sell it into your country's currency of choice, by moving the BTC to a different site than Bitfinix and cashing out?
If anything, this sounds like something that would fuck up a country's dollar, not fuck up Bitcoin.
But it wouldn't fuck up any country's dollar unless the amount of tether used to buy BTC was ridiculously high.Is anything I'm saying wrong?
"Muh tether" sounds like "its fucking nothing" just like I thought before I knew what it was.
It's just some form of FUD.

What?
No, you can sell your BTC wherever you want and for any fiat currency or any retard that accepts it.
You could probably buy a hooker with BTC directly.
So then that means tether LITERALLY is only beneficial to bitcoin.
You can buy BTC with tether, then sell it for real USD on a different exchange.
it was.

T-this is economic terrorism...
 Tether hasn't been able to accept usd since april of 2017Bitfinex is #1 in trading volume under "USD" which is really USDTNo one has done the math on how much bitfnix/tethers is in BTC, when this thing drops it will bring all other altcoins.Remember...when btc comes down, so does alts
Nah, I think any alt that has real fiat backing will manage to survive.
They'll be hurt, but they'll survive.It's all those alts floating around on usdt-only exchanges that'll kill themselves over.
