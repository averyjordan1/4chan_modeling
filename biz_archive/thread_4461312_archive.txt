Is this a bad thing to do?>buy item frequently that I always use>it costs $180-$190 every time I buy it>not looking for a deal on it but come across a large amount of what I need>able to afford it but spend $800 on something just the other day>if I buy this item, I can buy 4 of them for $130 each, effectively saving about $200>but it's right nowIs this dumb?
Or should I just jump on it?
so drugs?
Projector bulbs?
Buying an ounce is always better than buying a gram
Dragon Dildos?
What item ffs.
If it's drugs, you should always buy more than you think you need, if you can afford it.
You'll use it eventually, it's a hassle to buy, and it's cheaper that way.

ammo
Definitely buy ammo in bulk.
You'll never be bagholding, it doesn't depreciate easily, and once the dollar collapses it'll moon.
