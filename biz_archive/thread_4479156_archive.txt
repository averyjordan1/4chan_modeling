I ain't clicking that shit.
everyone tries to transfer to sell>btc a broken piece of shit>everyone goes to sleep after no confirmations after 4 hours of waiting due to fees rising>price up 5% next day>everyone decides to HODL againI see literally nothing wrong with this
but i'm supposed to profit from others' impatience
start mining I guess
tfw the bitcore core team are on record numerous times saying slow transaction speeds and high fees causes stability>they are right
You will regret it.
