I fear this attempted coup on BTC has caused a shift.
Rodger Ver is directly attempting to overthrow Satoshi as the richest BTC holder in human history.I think Satoshi's going to return, guys.
How can satoshi return if he's dead?
Is he literally going to be jesus now?
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now

Shows how afraid they are of losing dominance over all cryptos, they're hiring low quality russian social dudes to try to save face.
