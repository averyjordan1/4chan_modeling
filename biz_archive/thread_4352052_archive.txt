Whats the best way to do my taxes on crypto trades?
I keep all trades stored on cointracking.info but do I need to report EVERY trade?Can I summarize trades?
To what extent/accuracy can one summarize trades?Are there trades I don't have to report?
Is it only to USD it needs to be reported?
And not when trading between coins/tokens?
Here are some titties as thanks for contributing, pretend shes listening.
Poo on the IRS form and then mail it in
thanks its stinky
