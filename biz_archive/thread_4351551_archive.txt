How can you deny the power of XBC?
Like this: No.
I can't
XBC is amazing.
It has had a rough few months with BTC syrocketing but there have been quite a few times where it really made a bad day good for me.
I always run my wallet as a node It has historically been a very good thing to hold during turmoil.
The fact it wasn't included in the poloniex delisting announcement (first of ?
for fall/winter 2017) is part of what it needed to resume its uptrend, and this btc./bch chaos helped it as well.
The more people that try it out and see how good the coin is the more it will succeed.
Anyone looking for a hedge watch this coin and try it out.
It is about half a GB blockchain and light running client.
Very fast transactions and extremely good network structure as far as maintaining weight and limiting orphans.
We are gonna make it OP.
