so.. kraken's got overwhelmed once again.
order time-outs, funding/withdrawals disabled etc.is there any stable exchange with fast EUR cashin/cashout options?
Most of my money is with them.
Should I be worried?
bitstamp is smooth as silk, but only has BTC, ETH, XRP and LTC
switched to Bitstamp.
this shithole will destroy you next time there's panick.
you can't even get a sell order through in under 30 minutes on a normal day.
Yeah doggy, I'm transferring away from them because somehow all my limit buys never get triggered.If you're the buy and hodl type, don't worry about it, if you day trade, or even week trade, it's not worth it.
THIS.
You are not the only one.
The last 2 weeks have been extremely shitty.
Only 1/5 orders get accepted, errors, server time outs, says order didnt go trough when it did...fucked me good.
same here... they're running an exchange on toasters
Dont even try their smartphone app.
They managed to make it even more shitty somehow.
I use gdax
can't even register there from my country
I sent a support ticket and then I was able to withdraw 10 minutes later.
It took 2 hours of trying though.Gonna avoid them from now on if I can
Gatehub.
It's focus is Ripple but it also deals with ETH and BTC.
You can cash in and out fast for euros or dollars and can also buy physical gold.
When I want to cash out, I just buy some XRP, transfer it, which takes about 8 seconds, then sell for EUR, which they will SEPA to your bank.
Gdax best for daytrading
balkan guys?
I've never had any problems with Coinbase/GDAX.
Use a VPN.
ExpressVPN is only 10â‚¬ per month or some shit like that.
litebit
i know, but i'm a bit scared of coinbase's account freezing policies if they somehow smell shady shit
