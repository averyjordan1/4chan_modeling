Where are the legacy /biz/tards?
The ones that didn't jump into crypto last week or last month and the ones that don't cream their pants or neck themselves when there's a 50% moon or dip?THE REST OF YOU PRETENDERS STAY OUT OF MY THREAD!
LEGACY /biz/ ONLY
I guess there's no LEGACY /biz/ left on this board./thread
does June count?
Honestly it seems like as people "make it" they leave, and are replaced by a new generation of neets that want to "make it".
I came here from /pol/ and I have noticed at different times since starting an influx of new users from other boards.
Pretty sure even /tg/ is on the /biz/ bandwagon now.
And I saw a vitalik buterin gif in /gif/ last night as well.
Not to mention that Penis Kegel spammer who I can only assume is from /fit/.Long story short, buy kneepads and chapstick and suck one million dicks for a dollar each if you really want to make it.
Sorry.
LEGACY /biz/ is pre-ripple 1000x moon.
Buy ethereum
I was on /biz/ the day crypto was ousted from /g/.Made lots of money.
Heavily invested in ETH as well.Got married, bla bla.
Left 4chan.Then suddenly lost everything, wife left me, blew all my crypto.
sold ETH around $20.Now I'm starting literally all over again and seeing my potential gains had shit not wrecked me is painful.
But I lost a lot more than that anyway outside of crypto.I should of made it already.It begins again.
Oh well.Next time I'm never trusting another roastie.I have come to learn that I love money more than women.It costed me everything to learn that.
Don't worry anon.While Old Money and LEGACY /biz/ might not be with us anymore, in a years time, this will be known as Smart Money /biz/.
The early adopters riding the wave of financial institution.You won't see nearly as many gains as before though.
I fucking hate the ADHD spastics that go mental over their moderate gains.

Even in loss, as long as you learn something you are still making a gain.
the ones that don't cream their pants or neck themselves when there's a 50% moon or dip/biz/ was like this last year too.
Just saying.
I was in a community mining pool in /g/ around 2011.
We all got together and pooled the collective power of our AMD cards.It suddenly disappeared 5 days later.
Guy probably got away with his 50 BTC from that block, was only $1000 that day but now it's almost half a million.
