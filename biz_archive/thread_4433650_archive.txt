At those laughing at my previous post.You guys need to start reading.
Offcourse I wasnt talking to myself, I was responding to the original post.
Listen if you're looking to go from $1 to $1.50 in profit, then put your money in BCH, they'll get to $2k in a month.
But what you're looking for is to go from $1 to $50, you'll need some researching to do.
Don't buy at the ICO price, buy from impatient bounty hunters who are eager to dump for pennies before the project gets listed on coinmarketcap.
Coinmarketcap is when the rest of the world comes in and then theres a pump, If you bought earlier that pump is your selling tme not buying.
This is how real bulls do it.
Remember no just any project, but a strong project with a strong community.
And I recommend TIO, it's a german company with a powerful project.
There's only 450,000 in supply, so it'll definitely get to $2.
You can get it now for less than $0.08 Follow this link.
Do your own research
