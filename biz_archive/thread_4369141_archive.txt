It benefits the token holder with divivends to start late this year or next year which grow with the amount of transaction volume and pays out in ETH.
If you use the card in everyday usage, from each purchase you get 0.1% of that purchase back in PAY.
But it's a closed supply so the Dev have slowly buy back PAY to give to users.And they already have a working product, that convert BTC, ETH or DASH staright into fiat for purchasing.
Plus North America is coming soon.This card will help in getting those normies into crypto.
I'm expecting the price to be $15 - $20 in 2018, but I havn't brought any yet.Find a fault with TenX's PAY.
I can't find any.
Because Monaco > Tenx
I love everything about PAY and I'd definitely fuck the CEO, but token holders can't really make much until it sees a ton more adoption.
It's good long term but is fucking terrible if you plan on holding less than a year.
