Predict when news will come outI'm thinking Feb 2018
Anon posted the night the 'swift.smartcontract.com/bonds' page was leaked saying "You guys aren't supposed to see this.
I have contacts at Swift, this will be taken down shortly.
Expect news before eoy.
">Could be larp that predicted the near future>Could be truth>Time will tell
I saw that post, it was 100% larp
I thought it was December
LINK>no news all of 2018>no news all of 2019>news comes out June 23rd 2020>it's just an image of a Sergey on a toilet dead of a heart attack>LINK prices at sub 1 sat
December is when SWIFT announces the results of the test, everyone already knows the test is happening so this is unironically priced in The team expects to release the main net in Q1 2018, and Rory said any partnership announcements will come after the launch, if everFeb-March 2018 we will probably see some partnership stuff, hoping to ride a few shitcoin rockets to increase my LINK stack before then
they said december
BlockMason has news coming out next week, been seeing it all over this forum.anyone know what it is?
4423372The december PoC results is really fucking up my plan.
I have some SALT holdings that i expect to moon this december and I'm planning on putting them in LINK and REQ after SALT moons.But now even LINK and REQ have updates set for december wtf?
I'm going to buy in a week or so i'll have no chance of missing the possible rocket.
If SWIFT suddenly announces something unexpected along with the results and I'm not holding LINK, I'll be so fucking pissed.
it's a shit cointhey're all shit coins

REQ have updates every two weeks m8
Yeah updates but they said they're launching the website on creating requests on December.
later that day
Everyone buy in 11/29 and get comfy.
