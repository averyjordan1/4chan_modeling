I hate my life and want to quit my job and move to Thailand.
How can I grow my portfolio enough to retire?
24 hr change .00>on that much money it hasn't moved a centLARP
I have less than half of what you have.
Just collect NEETbux and wait for BTC to hit 1 million like the rest of /biz/
Should've put it in POWR a week ago.
fake and gay
Move your whole stack into ARK.
Collect dividends 10% Dividends.
There, 20k a year is enough to live like a bourgeoisie in Thailand
ignore these faggots.
$250k is enough to retire in Thailand.
i just downloaded this app after seeing the 1300 dollar guy.
i bought 10 bitcoin at 20 usd and 535 eth at 296. i want to double up first.
basically 200k was my own money
if you wanna double it safely just keep it in ETHXMR or ARK are also good options
Put it all into a selection of staking coins.
ARK, Etheroll, Lisk, etc.
Live off the dividends in SE Asia, live like a middle class man.Alternatively
