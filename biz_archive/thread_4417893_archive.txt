I want a something that will populate and cancel buys on GDAX with a keystroke.
What would you use for this?
Is there a way to do it through the API?
Should I just try to set something up with AutoHotKeys?
I want to be able to quickly create maker orders on GDAX to avoid the commission.
Then to be able to quickly cancel them if they don't go through.
