Someone on craigslist is selling a bitcoin for 5,500 dollars cash.
im thinking of ways that he can scam me.im thinking he can send it to me with a low fee, i give him the money, then he can try to send it again with a higher fee.
what should i do guys i just want to buy chainlink with it and forget about itdo i have to wait until all the confirmations are done?any way he can hack me?
coinbase niggaalso don't buy link, buy a top 20
Wait until it's on your wallet.I think he is trying to avoid taxes, which is why he sells cheap
You're about to get robbed
Best case scenario you are laundering money, worst case you are robbed.
hmmm possible.
but i think he just wants to avoid taxes, said he is on disability.how long will i have to sit around and wait with a stranger?
In this case should someone go with several friends just in case?
thats the thing, i have to fly to him, he is in michigan.
and he said no one there wants to buy any bitcoin.
so i have to fly and meet him.
but it is worth it if i save a couple thousand bucks.
Lots of friends and guns , or to a police station.
Where i live we have substations that have a room to conduct trades .
They are monitored .
if you show up with 5k cash, you're gonna get robbed.
You're going to show up and find out he's selling a quarter with teeth marks on it.
so i have to fly and meet himhmmmm there's a lot that can go wrong here
JUST take those $5500 and flush straight down the toiletBetter than wasting your time doing all that just to buy Chainlink
