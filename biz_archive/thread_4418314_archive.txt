No but yes
It got hacked you retard.
The new chain without the hacked funds is called "ETH".
I still can't comprehend why this still exists.
Who maintains a network that pretty much exists to protect hacked funds?
Talk about cucked.
It's not a sleeping giant, it's more like a tree stump that's still just barely alive as the rest of the tree was planted elsewhere that grew and will soon bear fruit.
ETH is a scam coin that was made to bail out the DAO.
Vitalik is a weeb that is in over his head.
Now they are trying to shift from POW to POS.
And they are going to fuck that up too.
Keep telling yourself that.
The truth doesn't matter, only the way you interpret it does is typical 4chan logic.
It will once people start realizing that a lot of the good tokens are developing their own coins.
And the ethereum network will become irrelevant.
good tokensHAHHahhaaHAHAHHA
That's kinda my point soon enough ETH will only be used for shitcoins.
fork of SCAM still SCAM
Vitalik doesn't have 70M ETH, GTFO
Since the price stabilized at circa 17 $ and not just dropped back to 10 $, I think it can grow even more..
Goddamn Pajeet at least fix your english
Its a dark horse, no doubt
Sleeping midget
It has alot of potential to go higher.
