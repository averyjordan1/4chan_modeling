$CAG My current best pick would be Change!
An obvious sleeping giant with lots of potential!Information: Similar to TenX, Monaco, Centra but on top of payment processor, Change provides marketplaces such as Insurance, Investments & loans etc.Marketcap: 9mil Circulation: 32mil Overall: High chance for 10x.Change wallet will be released on December which is soon!

Bought in ICO, bought more on the dip.
Comfiest hold.
It'll explode once wallet becomes operational in December.
You forgot the best part senpai:0.5% of all payments volume to Change Token holders.83.33% of the revenues generated from Third-Party Service Providers are distributed evenly among Change token holders monthly.
Comfiest HODL today.

It's nature's way of telling her she belongs on her back.
