Will we ever enjoy prolonged horizontal BTC movements again?
Or is it only massive pump/dumps from now on?Fuck this market, you can't hold any coin in a comfy way like before, because bitcoin pumps or dumps constantly.
It is stable, it's literally only going up longterm.
when the tethers stop
fuck jihan man fuck that guy
COPING
complaining about volatility of cryptoDude just buy low and sell at +10% over and over and accumulate free money
Anybody who didn't see this coming should stop trying to trade crypto.>Jihan and the miners pump up BCH price>BTC falls as expected>Jihan and the miners dump BCH at the very top>Jihan and the miners pick up BTC super cheap>BTC blasts through dip in days and recovers to new ATH>Idiots stuck left holding bagsEven if you missed the BCH pump, buying BTC at $5500 was the next best move to take.
Instead everyone played into Jihan's hand and gave them a place to dump at when they bought at over $2000.
