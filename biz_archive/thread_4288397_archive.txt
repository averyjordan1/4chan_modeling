i just fucked it up.
i was gambling and the session just went down af in a distraction moment so i did not cut the losses manually as i am used to because i dont like to set auto stop loss, i didnt loose much money only 0.008 and im not even mad at it, but the reason of being asking for scraps on here is not about the monetary but personal value they have for me, as i said im not poor, and i could buy again those coins, but... where do i live you can buy crypto if its not peer to peer with a jew fee!
sorry for interrupting biz/ i would like to post something better next time.
thanks btw12jJ1z25GBRp1GcMEay2akGQoH6LgjD3xZ
