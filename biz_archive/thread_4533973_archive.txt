Know I'm asking anons who dgaf about me this butIs it stupid to, at this point, sink 10% of my entire savings into ETH?
I can afford to lost that and still live.
Murmurs of it reaching 500 by the end of this month make me think I should buy in and hold longterm.
Shame I didn't do that a week ago.
Or even a few days ago.
JUSTDO IT
No one knows and it may dip back down to 330-350 but is likely to go to 10k in 1-2 years
Downwards wedge like that is a bullish signal
ETH is the most stagnant coin out there, poor investment.
