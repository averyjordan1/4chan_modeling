If this mattered it would have affected the price when it was published.Coinbase giving out rogue miner fork coins was also announced during that time.
This news means that it is unlikely for the Bitcoin futures to be passed.
Not like corecucks like you shared this news.
Even people in plebbit dont talk about it that much.
Oh also if you read this letter you would realize.
Its a hedge fund manager afraid that the futures market is gonna swing down when everyone pulls their money out and dumps it in bitcoin.
He's a CME clearing member.
You think the other fags dont feel the same way as him?
Also either way its pretty bad for you corecucks.>cancel futures>or stop the tether bullshit going on so that institutional money can be allowedCurrently their strategy is to exclude Bitfinex from the Bitcoin price index, but we all know that even if they exclude it, Bitfinex would still affect the price of the market.
No tethers = not that much price action in BTC.
Even the faggots in Reddit are saging the threads lmao.
