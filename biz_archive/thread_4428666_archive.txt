Being poor hurts.
Diversity is a meme.
bTC and one alt is all you need
44293464429370sent ;)
I guess I should be happy the fiat value of my portfolio is up, but because I'm holding mostly alts, my BTC value is about half of what it was a few months ago...
fucking hell mate, if you didnt just put in arbitrary numbers what did you make it all from?
more for luck?1UDyN8Fz4dtrnAYJY9xcq7S3MQaFYirA5
Switch eth and BTC.
You will be glad you did.
Regardless you have the best folio here
x72d729eaf972491c3ab845d800e0fd2b8f9210e4
Are there seriously pajeets spamming their eth addresses because they think the 100MM blockfolio from an ED fatfinger is legit?
Holy fuck

Poorfag checking in
honest question, why bother if it's only $25?
just means you have more things to keep track of, doesn't seem too worth it to met.
does similar things and doesn't know why
4429612sent ;)
For the fun of it in case it increases by X10.
You are right though, it is stupid and I will probably get rid of it again.
It makes my OCD tingle.
i'd put my 0.15 btc in to ltc or omgsell your btg for omg
For the fun of itaye fair enough, desu i mostly view my crypto stuff as a game in itself, practically dont care about the actual money
Let's see if I get laughed at.
don't you find it annoying as fuck holding so many alts?
you have like ~$20k on that page visible, presumably another 10+ alts spread among the remaining $10k.
I used to have a boatload of alts too but if the markets ever went to shit it's a pain in the ass trying to liquidate like 20+ different coins simultaneously.
at least you have eth
Me too late to party?
Your the best bro!0x6832C389f0195E1639908Ba284FCb6fF2AADf7D2
Alt season is back baby

I want to free up some shitcoin trading money, but I can't bring myself to sell anything.

Maybe I'm retarded but I never understood those blockfolio threads.
How do we know how much capital you started with?
You can have 30k rn and could have started with 100k.
Someone explain?
Because Ark is the best project in Crypto right now.
I'm about 80% in Ark myself.
Looks promising.
2018 is going to be comfy
This guy fucks
Betting on some moonshots.

Newfag nocoiner here, can I purchase crypto currency directly through the blockfolio app?
no.
it is just for tracking

wtf is this even real?
I have been lurking for too long I wish I could afford to invest... wanna kickstart a poorfag?0x62044942D867AF8B1989cDbA1280a106B5d42b3d
I poor
So is it possible some of these people are lying about their portfolios?
Or how does the app know how many coins you got?
4431009what did he mean by this
You manually input everything.
You can lie incredibly easily.
yes, they could be lying.
you insert transactions manually quantity and bid price.
It does not.
Trades are inputted by the user.

I don't think I'm going to make itI've made so many mistakes I should have 500k by now
No wonder you haven't made it, I'm telling you if you put all your money on NEO right now you'll get a great profit of at least 100k.
Thank me later..
I’d swap that Walton for Mod.
what mistakes have you made?
just started so interested in advice.
Why?
Genuine questionWalton have a working demo and Genesis block in Q1 2018
Mod already has 49 customers lined up.Pharma insidersTaking advantage of new Pharma shipping regulations
So many1.
Selling 11k ANS (Neo) at $92.

I don't normally beg, but...
Thanks friend!
all these newfags responding to this post not knowing what they're looking atYeah, I hate how etherdelta fatfingers jacks up your entire blockfolio.
bitcoin should be at LEAST ten percent of your holdings, if not much more.
i've wasted so much time gaining small amounts in alts where i could have doubled if i just kept btc
I swear where the FUCK did all these pajeet come from?
bullshit

tfwwell I still get 15% ROI as a staker so not too bad.
If blocknet reaches $1bil (certainly possible imo once SPV comes out) I could theoretically live off blocknet income.
Also if it did do a 10x I assume it would probably have a decent amount of volume so I would probably get quite a bit more that 15%.
fag
Poorfag & new to the game.

Would anyone be interested in an alternative to Blockfolio?Primarily to solve these basic problems:>the need to select an exchange for every currency, some of which don't update the price of the coin (for more obscure alts)>the clunky charts that have only an option to view based on preset time intervals, and no way to zoom or scroll
dumb fucks begging that can't even read.
