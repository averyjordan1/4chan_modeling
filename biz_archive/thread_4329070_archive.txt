I just started to get into crypto, because I like the concept of a global currency which the government has no control over.
The trading was fun, but it also hinders growth of crypto imo.
And all this stuff about Chinese miners manipulating prices is cyberpunk as fuck.
I had a ton of fun this weekend, and I only bought BTC for 100 dollar.
But this fun will probably turn into stress and get me addicted.
I already spend the weekend looking at charts, shitposting here and reading into this instead of learning for college.
Maybe I will get into all of this in a few years, but right now it just takes way to much time.
You probably wont care, but I wish you the best of luck.
ÃŒ seriously hope that your coin of choice moons.
Most of you deserve it more than most rich people anyway.
shut up and kys
See ya.
No sympathies here.
If you can't stomach the ride, you don't deserve the gains.
see ya tomorrow!
