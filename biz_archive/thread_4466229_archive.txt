This is now the official PBC-thread.What do you think it's going to be?
I sold my POWR at very comfy 6k and I'm going to be fucking mad if he chooses it.
Should I all-in DNT before the PBC release?
Slr , search electricchain and u see
I dont know why so many people don't realize that it's DnTlook at the graphs man.The coin is going to be one that hasn't already pumped.
Be smart.Accumulate.
Don't make the price spike.
Get in before it's "Official"You realize that by the time we KNOW which coin it is, it'll already be halfway to the moon, right?
Everyone knows it's slr by now jeez stop those threads
Whatever it is, it's a trap.
Do not sell your BTC.
BTC will keep going up and your alt will stay down.
It's risky business trading with altcoins.
You may have a windows of 5 minutes to sell or lose all your profits (you're lucky if you can catch BTC as it keeps going up).
You will most likely end up losing BTC value (and money).
