I did it.
l just bought 1000$ of bitcoin.
I've been watching it since it was 200$ and l was always hesitant to buy thinking it was going down.
I can't take this shit anymore.
I just see it going higher and higher.
I'm prepared to get JUSTED after it crashes I don't care anymore I'm already dead inside
i remember buying bitcoin at $200 back in the days hahahaha
buy high sell low
any buy under 10k will look good in a few years

Big mistake, you can rectify it by spending that BTC on BCH.
Should net you a healthy x2 over the weekend, minimum.
