Been in since like $6, already tripled, I expect at least $50... by the time the airdrops are done should be $75,000 on my k investment
I'm interested, but i have a few questionsis BTX in any way related to the other Bitcoins, apart from name?does it have backing from anyone significant in the crypto community?why BTX instead of LTC or other speedy, but well established cryptos?
im in since $4.. they call it a virtual fork.
3% airdrop every week.
BTC snapshot occurred, if you had BTC at time of snapshot you can claim 25% in BTX.
Don't know about backing, segwit already implemented though... so it has a fucking leg up on all these bullshit BTC forks -https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1883902.0
I joined Airdrop but haven't received any, am I meant to have minimum of 1 btx?
yeah uhm giving free coins to everyone every week will just tank the price.
from site:"Every monday all registered wallets which are loaded with at least 1 BTX will receive a 3% bonus payment!
That's a three percent interest Every.
Single.
Week.
Enjoy!
"how is 3% a week sustainable?this
Its not everyone, you have to have BTX in your wallet
Yes it says so on their site.
Yes, you need to have BTX and register the address that BTX is in or else you don't get the airdrop
Wait Bitcoin core isn't just what they call the original BTC before the BCH fork?
I'm so confused.
and hungry.
Thought so, thanks
Its Bitcore, not bitcoin core
Jesus christ.
These retards have muddied the waters so much no normie is going to touch this shit ever.
how can they afford to give anyone with 1 BTX 3% a week?having $1000 in BTX would bring me to >$1125.5 in a month>$1425.76 in 3 months>$4132.25 in 1 year300% growth a year is not fucking sustainable
% growth*
its not forever... its not a built in feature to the blockchain.
Airdrops are only done manually by the devs for now.. it will end sometime next year
so doesn't that mean a crash is inevitable when the main thing attracting people to BTX goes away?>welp there goes my 12.5% growth a week, time to move it all back into BTC
nah dude.. get all your info from 4chan.. never #DYOR go all in everytime
that would be like if>XMR removed all their privacy features>ETH removed smart contracts>MIOTA decided to start charging a 1% fee
I've been in since around 2$, mining this with gpus have been ridiculously profitable AND they give you 3% each week on top, madman gains.They have premined coins which they give away as an airdrop, the coins will eventually run out and airdrops will stop, at this moment there are around 5.2 million coins left to be distributed via airdrops.
Literally 20 times more rare than bitcoin
so why wouldn't most people just sell when airdrops start?
4339173when airdrops stop*
Good question, in october there was a large dump when one time 25% airdrop happened but price recovered within few days.
The growth of the coin is definitely on the healthy side without massive spikes.
Personally I'll try to liquidate gains around january, the airdrops are expected to end around feb/march 2018.
