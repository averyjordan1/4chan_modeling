Pro tip stay away from anything with a high market cap.Discuss
Mmm not really they're usually less volitile.
But if you want gains its harder to get with them because it took NEO like 20k BTC volume to go up 73% and only breafilly.
I have the same strategy.
That why i invested in TokenCard, much smaller Marketcap then TenX and MCO.
