What do you use to stay alert and focused when working?For me it's coffee, modafinil, and (rarely) methamphetamine.
What do you guys use?
discipline
I used to use coffee and Kratom but now that I'm on Prozac I'm not sure how if it would interfere.
Anything Prozac friendly?
water and mango
Why yes, m'lady, I do as a matter of fact use drugs in order to maintain peak performance while shitposting on Uzbekistani spaghetti art forums
I use the power of Jesus Christ to unleash The Final Getsuga Tensho
I meant to add that good diet, sleep and exercise are the foundation.
But what else helps on top of that?
I bring my work to a screen.
Limits my options but works wonders.

If I have to stare at an actual physical spreadsheet for more than 15 minutes my brain wanders off into oblivion.
