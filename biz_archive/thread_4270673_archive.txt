Lads is it possible for a wallet to give you the wrong amount and by wrong I mean displaying 2x as much as you should have?I am using Exodus and the wallet does require synchronizing and when I synced last night it seems to have deposited a sum in my account of more than I had previously.I thought this situation would change by the morning.
But I still have the extra funds.
Hey if its possible to cash out some of this money is there anyway I'd get in trouble?
If you move those funds you will break the blockchain, police are on their way
That's mine!
you've been visited by the money skelly.
Send it to an exchange and find out.
Someone this morning had a thread thinking they had more than they should, but it was less on an exchange.
Sounds like Malware, when you try to withdraw it may trip the code to change the withrdawl addressYou need to find and delete 'system 32' under My Computer right fucking now
