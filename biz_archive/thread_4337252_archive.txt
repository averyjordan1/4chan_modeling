>Muh hash rateNewcomer shouting their visions as truth.
Truth is that they dont know shit.
Positive side about this massive bch pump&dump was that alot of people learned very important lesson.
Question is when is this trick going to be repeated on bitcoin gold?
Next time i wanna surf the waves, not just watch them.
So many orders...
What's going to happen here?
Is it going to crash or moon?
BCH strugling again, 1,3blocks/hr, now they need emergency difficulty adjustment to kick in again.
LolIf everyone understood these twonscreencaps no one would buy bch
Btc mooning to new ath<Bch collapsing to shit since no one is pumping anymore and only pajeets trading with pocketmoney
They're hard forking today to fix this, idiot.
