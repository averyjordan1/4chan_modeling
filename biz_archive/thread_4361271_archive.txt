Went half into pot stocks, half into crypto in September.50% gains in crypto 110% in potComfy!!
Why Canadian?
American is better and less taxes.
The entire west coast from Alaska to California weed is legal plus a few outliers like Colorado.

cannabis is for the entire country, not just select states.

cannabis is for the entire country, not just select states.
legal age for consumption is 19.The legal framework is being left up to the provincial governments.
Therefore, each province may end up having different rules (prices, legal age, etc).Also, I'd like to buy some but I feel the impending legality is already baked into the stock values.
Am I wrong?
heck if i know.
theres a lot of speculation about how it will play out.i bought a bunch while it was cheap and its gaining traction now
where are they traded?
