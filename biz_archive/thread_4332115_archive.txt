Do you hide your power level?I used to wear a bitcoin T-shirt and had bitcoin wallpapers on my laptop and phone, but I decided I didn't want people to know how deep I am in the crypto game.
I certainly don't want to attract unwanted attention.
No one cares
I wear Gucci
You probably barely even own a full bitcoin you fucking faggot
yes and buy nice watches that offer understated elegance yet still extreme luxury, like F.P.
Journe or Gronefeld, instead of a fucking two tone rolex submariner
you probably came/come off as autistic irl, and this 
I have close to $18k in crypto assets.
i'm sorry to be harsh, but wearing crypto-related fashion items is extremely autistic.
I told my family about it in August and then the China FUD happened.
Dad called me an idiot when he saw it dip to ~2.8k.
Knew it was coming back up and didn't sell.
Havent mentioned it to him since
I'd rather people just know me as the guy who doesn't work but has money to do whatever I want.
This
except doge , doge is cool as fuc
No one but /biz/ and some other online communities know I hold crypto.
I actively fud it IRL.
Should- should I buy 100k?
I scribble bitcoin is better with sharpie on 5/10/20$ notes every now and then.
I heard a lot of /biz fud it irl, even call people fags that dare mention it.
I tell people I know about it but tell them I don't hold any.
I live in auscuckland people are talking about it a lot because they like money but don't understand it.
If I don't want to talk about it next some dumb bitch is asking me I just say it's a Ponzi scheme and only terrorist and child rapists use it.
I just say it's a Ponzi scheme and only terrorist and child rapists use it.
