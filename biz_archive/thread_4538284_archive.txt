Been looking at a coin for awhile and am puzzled by it's valuation.
How can TokenCard(TKN) raise 170k (ETH), valued at 71 Million USD today, but only has a market cap of 30 Million USD?
Also, one of its competitors , MCO copied TKN's whitepaper and yet has a higher market cap, how does any of this make sense?
Crypto is full of irrational investors and the rational investors make rational decisions based on knowing how irrational others are, reinforcing the trend towards irrational valuations.
What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't make sense.Consider bitcoin being numero uno for so long despite objectively being one of the most garbage coins in the top 100 and there you have it, the crypto market.
It's a foam of bubbles.
its a weird place, how can a company have a valuation lower than it's value of its assets, considering that it has no liabilities.
