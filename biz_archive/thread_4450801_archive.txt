I sent 1k ARK from Bittrex to my wallet just now and it hasn't showed up.Addresses match and everything..
Even send 15 over first as a test.
Will I ever see them again?
lol
Check your email for bittrex's verification email.
Never got one of those.
Is 3300 Ark enough to be comfy?
Everything bigger 2k is awesome, anon.
Anyone else saw the whale that's been driving the price down finally get slayed?
i-is it over?
Then you didn't send them.
Bittrex always sends a confirmation email for withdrawals
I CAN'T I ALREADY PUT ALL MY BTC INTO ARKSomeone give me btc quick!
