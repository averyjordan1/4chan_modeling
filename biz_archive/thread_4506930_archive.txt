Why haven't you bought Lisk yet?
I bought at 80k sats OP
How does Lisk have more potential than Ethereum?
Care to enlighten me?
sidechains might be intersting for companys who want to use blockchain but dont want to use a public chain like ethereum and also dont want to build a network of nodes too.
so they use a sidechain of lisk and plugin to lisk so the risk of getting butfugged is lower
ethereum has futures contracts coming...lisk is err good investment OP!
: )
-14%Lol and after a rebrand?
Wtf.
Because I don't want to be poor
