I'm trying to build up my twitter: twitter.com/lambolydiaSo let me give you guys one of my best tips.
Yes Powr is great and will hit 1B market cap within a week or two, it has the potential to make you 50x within a year or less, it may possibly overtake Ethereum shortly after that.Power Ledger is designed to work with every nation's utility companies, other cryptocurrencies don't do a fucking thing.
Not having as much POWR as financially possible means that you will stay poor and blow ass simultaneously.I've done a lot of research on this coin and it's extremely solid.
Trolls are going to bring up the jew broad and "muh MILF bangers" but don't listen to them.This coin is the ethereum killer.
They can both exist in the space because ETH is more of an alternative to BTC now rather than ground breaking tech.
Every problem that money skel wants to fix with gommunism Power Ledger already solved it.So yeah.
Go Powr.
Powr will hit $500, and while you're enjoying those gains BTC will begin to crash.
POWR may go 5,000x to a 10T market cap much, much sooner than you think.
Get in before POWR blasts off.
Follow me for great tips in the future.-twitter.com/lambolydia

OP is right.
~14,000% gains from entry now in about 5 months from now.

This is actually worst case scenario experts predict it overtakes eth in a month
