>/biz/ likes Bitcoin CashThe flippening ain't happening
Stop calling it bitcoin cash, it's bitcoin.Bitcoin "bcoin" Core needs the suffix
I like Dash.
biz seems pretty divided on the issue.
I don't like bitcoin cash at all.
I hold BTC right now but if bitcoin cash ever starts looking like it has a chance to actually surpass it(and not yesterday's pump and dump) I'll just switch over to ETH.
Why do you support centralized money?
Removal of full nodes so one party controls all of bitcoin (Miners), having to trust they won't have an issue with BCH in the future and fork that, no very much used anywhere other than trading, had to attack Bitcoin's chain to get everyone's attention instead of being judged on merits, it has a CEO even though its shilled as "decentralized," I can keep going on if you want.
the delusion is huge
Or paid.
you know roger ver propagated this "dont call it bcash" thing as a distraction tactic rightits literally pulled right from the trump textbookit gives any btrash supports the ability to completely dismiss any argument simply by responding "dont call it bcash" and ignoring the argument.
