NEO/USD ADDED TO BINANCEhttps://twitter.com/binance_2017/status/932454611473932288
DEAR GOD
Are the gearing up for something?!
you should short neo like right now
Why?
It’s no where near as big as they bluffed it to be.
3 devs and USDT pairs.
Nobody cares
I don't think that's the big news
>USDTWow its fucking nothing.
First Kucoin, now Binance.
The exchanges know something we don't
lol @ people downplaying USDT pairs.
USDT not USD.
DELET THIS
Bithumb tomorrow friend
Source ?
Idiots.
They are gonna drop a whole bunh of announcements.
All week long.So ur edgy ‘sell the news’ won’t work.
Comfy gainz ahead.
I wonder when fomo starts.
Pretty sure NEO is on a long climb up to $100 but it’ll be 5months at least.
If the Regulation news was real we would have passed $100 within 5 minutes of it dropping, and be at $250-$300 by the next morning.
So it’s not a matter of if, it’s just a matter of when and making sure you have at least 40-50 NEO in your pocket for when it does drop.
Twitter, or just look in Binance it's there m8
Exactly.
It's just an option to trade NEO for another coin.
One, I might add, that you can't use to cash out ironically.
Yeah my mistake, how i edit/delet?
