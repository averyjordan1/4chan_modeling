The same shit every week, iâ€™m pretty sure many people are getting tired of it.
At some point people will just abandon both chains and switch to something with less drama?
Eventually, yeah.
If BCH wins at least, which it will.At first BCH will become king, then the stigma of the miner politics and the exposed weaknesses of this kind of proof of work and probably proof of work in general will catch up with it.
In addition, ETH will transition to proof of stake and demand for ETH as fuel will rise as projects launch over 2018.
Both of these things will have tremendous upwards pressure on ETH price.These 3 things will be the primary causes of ETH overtaking BCH.
