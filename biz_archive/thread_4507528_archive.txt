Hey /biz/,I'm confused about why bitcoin cash calls itself bitcoin cash?
Why not have a totally original identity rather than being a spin off?
They want to be called bitcoin
cause all it has going for itself is having the name bitcoin its just another shitty altcoin
Because it's a fork of bitcoin.
Every btc address and values copied.
What we now call btc is the other hand if that fork.
They are both continuations of the original bitcoin block chain from before the split.
