WE'RE GOING TO BE MILLIONAIRES LADS
The beautiful thing about link is that even when you think you've bought at the lowest, it still keeps going down.
So even though its in the green now, I'm still down even though I bought at 16 cents.This is good because it keeps you humble.
So when I have my Lamborghini in 2020 I wont turn into a total asshole to people.
farthest it went down was 0,15
I KNOW AND IT'S GONNA BE FUCKING AWESOME
nice, just bought 100k
2 DEVS 1 TOILET
it's gon be great
it went up 0.5%
This(?I truly dont give a fuck, made gains with BTC, moved them to Link, it keeps its usd value so im not losing money, just the "opportunity cost" of not holding BTC diring its bullrun, but when Link bull run comes I will give less of a fuckAlso BTC really feels bubbly lately, the tech dossnt work as it should and people only buy it because it "always goes up in price".
Thats kinda the definition of a speculative bubbleDunno when it will pop though, might be tomorrow, migh be at 100k pero coin (doubt it though)

145% lossesWhy are the link fudders the most retarded anons around?I feed on your fud


I am coping / keeping myself deluded by having LINK/ETH pair in my blockfolio.
So I am only down 28% ETH, 0% USD.
It can go only up cos it's rent free r-right?

He actually owns linkAnon it was just a meme, you didn’t really buy did you?
don't worry in Q2 2018 LINK will moon all the way to $1.
you'll be right in time to buy the $100k BTC dip.
