Who else shill the fuck out of every shitcoin that buy and FUD when want to buy cheap or because he missed a moon mission and want that coin to burn and die?
me
literally every single person that's been here for more than a week
I FUD my own coins for fun.
Unironically this, if you believe in your investments, FUDding your own coins is the ultimate goof.
I have no idea what "One Belt One Road" even means!
