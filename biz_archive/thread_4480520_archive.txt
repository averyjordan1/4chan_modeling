haha today I got smashed on Solarcoin.
/biz I wish you guys better luck/insight than I have had.
Poor fag, wagecuck too.
Any advise on trading will be appreciated
step 1) don't buy gimmick coins.I admit I only looked at the landing page, but a coin that's 99% distributed to solar companies?
Really?
If the coin gets any value, then every time a solar company realizes they're sitting on major amounts of shitcoin they'll dump everything and crash the market.
POWROWR
It's a legitimate coin and not some BS ERC20 token.
It will recover if you can stand to hold.
If you slammed your whole portfolio in to it then damn, I feel for you.
I got burned by the PBC boiler room today as well, but I was only playing with 1% of my portfolio
Today I made 60% on ETH-POWR and ETH-BTCG and put it all into NEOUs Green IDs are just made of better stuff than you Pinkies.
