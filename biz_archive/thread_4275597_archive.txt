guys what do you think?Bitspark incorporated in Hong Kong since April 2014.
Its team produced a cash in, cash out blockchain remittance platform which facilitated an end to end transfer from Hong Kong to the Philippines using Bitcoin as the mode of transfer - the first of its kind.
The company is backed by The Cyberport, a Hong Kong government initiative and has joined acceleration programs such as Accenture Fintech Innovation Labs and SixThirty.Since then it has expanded to seven markets predominantly in Asia and Africa with over 500+ cash out locations ranging from banks, pawn shops, convenience stores and post offices.
Bitspark most recent release was Sendy, a mobile money app which enabled users to top up with Bitspark agents to send remittances via their mobile using the bitcoin network and without any techknowledge necessary!
Bitspark is launching Project Zephyr to eliminate banks from the remittance industry by rolling out 180+ fiat pegged cryptocurrencies via the Bitshares Blockchain and making Bitspark’s Money Transfer Operators a decentralised cash in, cash out network worldwide.
Zephyr Tokens will be used to reward those who economically benefit Bitspark’s remittance network and 25% of fees from successful transactions will be used to buy back tokens from the Zephyr market.
