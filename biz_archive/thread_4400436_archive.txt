Boomers have it rough.
All they know is work.
They hate or don't understand any of the activities the younger generations like.
All they can do after they retire is bake like rotisserie chickens in the sun, watch game shows, golf, or fix up cars.
All of which gets old very quickly.
It is for this reason they hate youngsters.
It is because we can be happy with so much while they only have 4-5 activities to keep them busy for 20 years before they die.
