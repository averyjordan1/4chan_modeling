WHAT'S HAPPENING TO POWR.
MY GAINS
he didn't listen to Lain
Look at LINK's graph.This is your future.. a fresh ICO right out the gates filled with so much hype and promise ofc it pumps like crazy, but then people start to realize nothing will actually happen for months if not years dump and the coin goes into a slow bleed as more and more people sell off each day..Then it just bleeds a slow death back to barely above ICO until stuff actually starts moving
 billion coins
powr actually has working product, the only value link has left is memes
That doesn't matter that much.
Buyers and sellers decide the value, there are currently only 350mil in circulation.
Some coins already have 1bil in circulation with a valuation of 2-3$
Look at the chart anon.
Do you know anything about elliot waves?
Wave number 5 is coming
Actually, I explicitly stated this is a good long term hold.Love,Lain
Link has a working product too lol it's had one before it even held ICO.That's literally what they were demonstrating at sibios
