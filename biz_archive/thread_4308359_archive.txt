“The Bank of Korea states that Bitcoin and other virtual currency are not valid currency or payment instruments in South Korea read an excerpt of BOK’s statement at the time.>Speaking in South Korea’s capital of Seoul last week, the central bank governor reportedly said: “I must emphasize that BOK does not see bitcoin as an official payment tool in South Korea so all people should know not to use Bitcoin as a means of payment.
There is a risk.”WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?!?
SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL
the value is not set by the banks but what people are willing to pay for it.
what the bank thinks is irrelevant.
Bitcoin was designed specifically to piss off banks and politicians.
All this type of shit is already factored into the price.
Wait a minute, if this is the case then how are koreans going to pay for their coffee?
