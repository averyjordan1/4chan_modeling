What do you think the entry price for mining various currencies is?I assume it's downright autistic to get your hopes up and try to mine bitcoins as an individual in this day and age, even more so if you're just starting now.So, how much do you think it would take to see any kind of profit from various major currencies?
And would you even be able to sell any coins you'd gain from it and turn a profit?Is it just better to buy and sell at this point?
