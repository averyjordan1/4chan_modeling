Start a Coinbase account and buy ETH on it, then start a Binance account, transfer the ETH to it, then buy LINK/ETH on it while its low.
It should be worth about $25 a coin mid 2018.
It is currently $0.16/LINK - and it became available in sept 2017.
Its new, so get on board with this before it goes to the moon anon.
You dont want to miss your chance to get rich.
Go donate plasma if you have to but whatever you do, but LINK.
