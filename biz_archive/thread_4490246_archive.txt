Greatest presentation of all time
It was one of those instant pumps that biz fell for
It was right towards the end of the great spring bullrun, and a lot of newfags came in looking to get rich quick, like me.
There was some stupid ass Citibank competition that got blown way out of proportion to the point of becoming "CITIBANK IS GOING TO USE DIGIBYTE!
WE FINNA BE RICH NIIGAS!"
and everybody fomo'd in out of stupidity.
Digibyte didn't win shit from Citibank.
There was no contract, and the dumpening happened.
The people who weren't fucking retarded took their losses and bought antshares.
The people who are retarded are still bag holding to this day.
The DGB threads were everywhere and then when it dumped suddenly DGB discussion disappeared.
Same thing happened with RDD

That's right and after I witnessed the DGB disaster I steered clear of antshares because I thought /biz/ was retarded.
Missed another chance to get rich.
