Stop wasting your money on crypto - It's all like this pump and dump with no substance.
Learn how to trade Forex and precious metals, how to make technical analysis etc.
I only traded Bitcoin Cash because it was more than obvious super-pump.
that's no fun.
If people werent losing money there could no money be Made tho
Funny thing is I have absolutely no idea how crypto works - I'm a day trader.
I only made big buck here because i know how the market psychology works especially with so many uneducated people coming in and pumping
cash out 5k so you can never lose that.Also btc probably found its bottom, you should be carefull in bcc now.
