Novembers planned newsletter leaked internally.
Since the prices already pumped Teeka changed the newsletter for new pick on Monday.Shortly after he announced his newsletter would be postponed RLC trade volume increased for one day like Zencash before the pump.
My suspicion is that Teeka and crew started loading up on the new coin in advance.
We all know what happened last monthâ€¦.This is just my thoughts.
Do your research.40M market cap smallest satoshi but most progressV1 working product already released unlike Golem who has nothingNew partnerships with ChinaRoadmap High Education TeamA big surprise coming next week
I had the same thought last week.
The focus of this project (blockchain-independent decentralized cloud platform that will be cheaper and more secure than existing centralized services) is quite different than golem's, which is supercomputing.
Teeka may be half snake-oil salesman but he isn't dumb
I'm a bit our of the loop for a past week.What about solar industry?
Was it just a ruse?
Well POWR has been rocking the fuck out all day, I think OP magic digits man and I were just speculating that this could be another unannounced pick
I hope so.
I expect this coin to triple within a few months anyways
