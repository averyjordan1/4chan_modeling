this shit will be big af, but i still regret holding instead of selling the top and buying now
Sideways for another 2 months that's in the event they manage a product without their lead dev who then started FUD
Same anon.
Had a chance to easily 2.5X my investment but now I'm here down 30% hodling.
I will be very excited if they meet their deadlines.
If not I will sell out.
i can wait 2 months for the gains this coin is able to get
In the meantime Ill trade other coins, 5x my stack and then come back to find it exactly where I left it.
Time is an opportunity cost unless you are a pathetic NEET.
i get what you are saying, but with the current market climate, I have no idea which ICO or shitcoin is worth putting money into.
Got no choic but to wait
I wish i sold the top and doubled my stack, but wtf ,who sells the most promising project one week after it hits an exchange?
Even then it was undervalued.
Well, next paycheck goes there.
Where my ODN brothers at?
k ODN, will I make it, bros?
Yes, all you need is 10k.
ODN is the future.We are a revolution.
you're addicted to flipping shit coins.
you are a degenerate gambler.
we are real investors.
