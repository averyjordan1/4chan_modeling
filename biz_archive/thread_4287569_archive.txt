Nice mempool :)
tfw you see bitcoin price collapsing and you cant even move funds from your hardware wallet to an exchange without paying $1000 feelollllllllllllllllllllllll
this is good for Bitcoin>it's digital gold after all>not meant to be spent like a currency
imagine being this new to crypto you think a 9% drop is collapsing
using a hardware wallet when coinbase wallet works fine
>b-b-but bitcoin is a store of value, just hodl :)))))))))))))))))))))
bitcoin transaction fees are a store of value
nice (((spam)))
imagine being this unaware of the context surrounding the drop
still not understanding this is alpha software.I bet you expect your shitcoin to reach the scale of BTC with no trouble
every 99% collapse starts with the first 9%
