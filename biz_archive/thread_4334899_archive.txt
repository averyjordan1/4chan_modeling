Genuine question.Is it possible that the pump and dump organized by R.Ver & Co was to drive the price of BTC down, so they could buy in again at a lower cost?
no, roger bought bitcoin at like 1 dollar or less or some shit, he aint gonna lower his cost average kek
everything is a scam in cryptoits an unregulated 0 sum game
Thats my point though, he wouldn't be taking a huge hit even if BCH were to drop to say, $300.
If he was REALLY dedicated to BCH, why does he still have holdings in BTC?
They wanted to drive the price of BCH up as much as possible while it was more profitable to mine it.
Now after the difficulty adjustment its more profitable to mine BTC again, so now it's dumping
