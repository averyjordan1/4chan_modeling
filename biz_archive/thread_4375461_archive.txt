>teeka said he is meeting with the team in Lisbon, Portugal>only power ledger was in PortugalWhy is there still a debate?
It's over.
PWR is 100% the pick.
this
I agree
I have 150k POWR coins.
My body is ready to receive Teeka's blessing.
a lambo for each finger?
No, Portugal WebSummit 2.0 was about tech industry in general, and there was only one speaker that is connected to cryptocurrencies.
And among 1200 speakers that was co-founder of Ethereum, Joe Lubin.It is easy to connect the dots from there :)
u boutta be rich nigga
It's a weird story, yesterday I had the chance to buy Mercury coin right when it hit Bittrex, and I just didn't for some reason.
I come back 5 hours later and it moon 7x.
I was so distraught that I said "fuck it" and went all in to POWR with my trading stack because it was the other coin that had been listed that day and hadn't moon'd yet.Did fate guide my hand?
Only the number of my future lambos will tell.
just don't forget to sell after the pump, see ama on Reddit, project huge scam
when does the actual report come out?
that confirms power ledger even more
a lamboMore like, an Merc SLR.
Get it?
Manure Ledger
You might be onto somethinghttps://consensys.net/ventures/partnerships/
Stop shilling this fucking coin pajeets
Teeka is the alpha pajeet what do you expect
?
Duh, Joe Lubin is cofounder of Consensys.
If you check their partnership, you can see they are indeed partnering with some energy companies.
but that could confirm solar as much as it could confirm powr, especially since the original person who mentioned him also said that powr wasnt in portugal
I see what you mean.
My personal opinion is that Joe Lubin could play a pivotal role in the next recommendation, as the guy and his company certainly lead in dApp development.The other coin could be SingularDTV, however I'm sceptical.
They had their major release just the other week I think and the dump commenced, don't think they will be in the spotlight.
