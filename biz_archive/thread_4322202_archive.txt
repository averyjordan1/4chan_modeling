Done my research and I threw my chips in, am fully confident this project and it's world changing capabilities.
It's nuts bro
Hi I learned what a bitcoin is yesterday.
I'm in OMG, ARK, NEO and REQ.
Nothing can happen to me
What changed your mind?
Sounds like you're shilling.
What are those supposed capabilities and what makes OMG better than any other shitcoin?
my dad works for Omise, he said that they're also opening a decentralised skateboard market place, don't tell anyone though because I don't want my dad to get firedi told u the news now go make bank biz
aw yes us omisegays cant wait until jun explodes all down our throat
if bitcoin takes the whole market down with it do you want to kill yourself with me lol
Been watching alot of videos actually explaining what it does and where it's global outreach is.
3rd world money transfer is ridiculous value.
Money will just flow into ETH.
Anything that has a pairing other than BTC will survive.
Sure prices will plummet temporarily but will recover.
That will be the best time to buy loads of alts for dirt cheap.
Top kek
>no wallet>no blockchain>WHEN PLASMA?
No desu no one gives a shit about this scamcoin
It'll explode before you can blink.
Get in now.
This is a literally cannot lose portfolio right now.
Either OMG, REQ, or both will 10x.I'm betting on REQ pumping first by EoY due to hype and product release, then trading those gains into OMG to be ready for staking activating in 2018.This is the play that will make me a millionaire.

lol yeah because that's exactly what happened in the past lol yeah
Actual alts that have a use besides being a currency will ultimately not give a shit about BTC.
The only reason they do is because you need to trade them through BTC.As crypto gets more and more mainstream you won't need to do this anymore.
I'm all in on OMG but I don' believe you.
