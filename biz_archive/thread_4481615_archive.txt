Hello /biz/, story time.>come to biz>lose everything3 days ago I discovered this board.
Of course I knew 4chan for longer and even shitposted to /b/ sometimes, but you guys were new.
Since I know you, my portfolio is down approximately 60%.
With yesterdays PotCoin "joke" I lost a significant fraction of my portfolio.
I was able to win a bit of it back with MTL but that was it.
So before I came to this cancerous board I was doing just fine.Because of this I have to ask you for reimbursement for these actions.
Now that I'm stuck here with you guys, at least make it fair.
You have the possibility to settle this dispute by transferring funds to my ETH [0xDB1564bA44292D718FA5f04aa1f269c4076196F7] or LTC [LKtrnoNWvVFX8uCsY5oGHRW3RgTZcxroSL] adress.
If somebody rolld dubs or trips he is legally obligated to help me out.If nobody is going to do so, I will have to die in this forum, shitposting and getting trolled every day, until the end of my life.Have mercy.

Enjoy, kys right now.
