Where are my funbros at?
Trying to get more than 500k FUN and failing
Hopefully will own about 15k soonI think it's very promising
Should I throw some silly money into this?
well a whale bought in a few days ago so i guess thats a reason why
Decent coin, I've made a couple hundred day trading it because of the massive swings.
They won't even have a complete product til early next year so I'm hodling some til at least then.
FUN FUN FUN FUN!
Fun bags are the best bags.
