This is a legit a buy now or cry later scenario not just shilling a coin to dump on noobs
muh new WTC>muh dev buyback 8xShit chink coin, avoid the hype.
Also to all the presale fudders the team is presenting presalers with 2 options.
1 sell to the team or 2 convert to wabi with 3-6 month lock up so no risk of dump on ico buyers
Why did they have to use that logo...
Hype is what makes coins good flips if you haven't noticed
What's the cap?
$11.5m
going all in, there's no way this shit isn't gonna pump through the roof
all ineth capok buddy
I own, Vechain - WTC - Ambrosus - Walton - Modum and I am going to buy this when it hits a real exchange and after the inevitable dump.
But lets get one thing straight.
Wabi is not =/= with Walton or Vechain.
I like Wabi as a project (mainly the PROVEN entrepreneurial spirit of the team(this is the fucking seller here!!
fucking push this!))
but it does not anywhere near have the resources or talents that Walton or Vechain have brought to the table.
Do not believe the shill posts about it being a WTC/Vechain but further along with an ACTUAL product because its not even close but what it could be is a user of the specialised RFID WTC blockchain and their RFIDS because Wabi's Rfid's are genreic shit ones.
