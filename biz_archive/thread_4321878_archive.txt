Give me one reason to keep this coin.
Contemplating to drop my bag for either VTC or XMR.
You'd kill yourself if it mooned without you
It feels like a stagnant coin
I dont know why /biz/ doesn't like to talk about VEN.
Threads always die without replies.
Yeah I don't know why.
Anyway... keep, vertcoin or monero?
Bump for more opinions
I have a nice stack of them, keeping them for the long tearm.
The team released a financial report, they are very transparant.
Their partnerships also blow Waltcoin away.
(yet don't think they are direct competitors)First blockchain company PwC invested in as well.
Working product.Future looks bright.
Thanks anon.
You are right... might just keep.
Bump
