if 59k btc volume gets traded everyday on bittrex and they get 0.25% fee... they are making at least $1mil a day O_ Owtf?
why haven't we started our own exchanges??
I own Binance
I'm using Binance rn, is it safe?
Yeah
No
sorry anon but BNB tokens are not shares of Binance exchange....
O_O >reddit spacingYou have to go back
none of this is safe as far as your initial investment goes.
any of us can get gox'd at any moment and that includes suffering losses due to decline of BTC due to loss of trust after a major exchange swindles everyone.
