It's a hanging man, and what's worse it's hanging without any support.
This is crashing soon.

pAJEETS NEVER CHANGE.
Heard that exact statement at 2100k, your right but this could easily go 3000k in 24 hours, nobody can time the dump.
Nobody can time the dump but holy fuck if you get caught up in that thing you are screwed.I'm happy selling here, might not be anywhere near the peak but it gaurentees me a good price for my bch and I made a nice couple btc profit over these past few days due to it
Bigger volumes are being sold that bought.
This is your confirmation that big players are leaving, what else do you need?
Here's your support dumbarsehttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactionsEvery single block found results in more money moving from BCH to BTC, the flippening is happening right before your eyes.
Money moving from BTC to BCH I mean, fucked that up lol
won't be the first and wont be the last time that hppanes lol
Nice, BCH is going to be huge with all these spam sell transactions at $0.15 with fees at $7.
So you're telling me that BCH value is going to increase thanks to negative money which will go straight to BTC-miners pockets?
That's amazing, almost magical.But seriously, did you even look at what exactly is going on on BC?
It's all spam, just like the last time when BCH pumped.
If someone wants to sell BTC they'll just use Shapeshift.io like same people.
