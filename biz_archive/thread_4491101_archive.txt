What's the new market?
Since alpha went down I haven't heard.
4491149fuck you nsa.
just have a look at some marketplaces, it's all over the forums
There isn't one.
.onion doesn't create regulations like that.
If anything it would he sellers start only accepting Monero since it's untracable, but that won't happen all at once It's a shill
>since a couple daysNever thought I'd see the day that pajeets started shilling monero.
Proof or GTFO
I was there when monero had just started getting used in drug markets.
It was at around 50 cents back then and jumped a few dollars soon after.
If what this guy says is true, monero will go even higher.
A guy (a baby whale) in my discord also mentionned monero could go to 300.
This might be the time.
