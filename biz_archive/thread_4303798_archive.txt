Bitcoin Cash's gonna hit $1600 in less than 5 hours and $2k on Sunday.
We are at $1400 now.What's your price prediction, goys?
k tuesday
The Flippening
$10000
I don't measure alts in fiat, only in BTC.Example: bcash is at 0.225 BTCs
Really, seriously.
You'll have a panic around 0.5 or so and then a rapid, rapid collapse of BTC.
Bitcoin Cash will then reach around $5k-$6k and then proceed on BTC's previous growth trajectory.
That's good to know.Euro here.
BCH kissing the 1200 euro wall.
I'm about to go to bed, and I'm kinda worried.
I decided to go 50% BCH and 50% fiat EUR for this night.
Let's hope it moves high, high up.
why are you going to bed at 8 pm?
1750 is the target, support at 1350flippening will happen but not instantaneously like people are assuming.Miners will switch back to BTC after BCH EDA goes out of effect, mining difficulty on BCH will go up 400%.
I like it.
I like waking up at 4am.
Never in a hurry, no clock alarms.
Lots of people in Americans to chat with.
Best for your Tuesday free time.
