I’m new but I heed skeptics warnings... these discord pnd schemes are getting better and better at hiding.
I joined in a few of these to see what was going on and asked questions.
Here’s what I came up with (oldfags feel free to correct me):1.
A few pajeets look at the market and find “le undervalued” coin... or conversely they look at their bags and pick one to offload.
Usually coincidentally an event or announcement to be made next day...2.
They go into their super-secret discord family where a bunch of whitebois are waiting for instructions... and they recruit more (see discord threads and other Bs shill threads).3.
They give the instruction to start a pump based on charts... (notice they give a volume guideline big enough to eclipse their bag volume)...when a schedule is given for the event (buy the rumor)...4.
HODL everyone until the event.
At this time they slowly trickle bleed off their bags..5.
Event happens and the volume of buys increases....they dump rest of the bags... but their dump is masked by the buys therefore the price stays relatively static through the event...6.
They’ve liquidated their position and on to the next one while they have created bag-holders7.
Discord followers make very modest gains...This is what I’ve deduced .
Being a newfag, I haven’t lurked enough to understand but this is the only way it makes sense for them to spend time and energy shilling and recruiting unsuspecting normies to “pump” groups..Am I right?
Forgot to mention on step 1, they buy a substantial position at a low price in the target coin to be dumped
these pumps are getting weaker and weaker though
Alt summer hasn’t gone into full swing yet though
