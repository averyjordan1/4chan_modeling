Did you ever hear the tragedy of Comfido The Comfy?
No?I thought not.
It’s not a story a bagholder would tell you.
It’s a /biz/ legend.
Comfido was a Dark Shitcoin of /biz/, so expensive and so comfy he could use the exchanges to influence the price to create bagholders… He had such a knowledge of the shitcoin market, he could even keep the ones he cared about from holding bags.
