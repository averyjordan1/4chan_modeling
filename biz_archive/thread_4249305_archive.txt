for some reason my first thread was archived before i got any useful insight, so i'll ask it again:sheep are mostly raised for meat where i livewool is mostly low quality and thrown away as a byproductwhich means it's freeprocessed wool is then imported, and quite expensivethis wool can be used for different purposes like clothing, bedding, insulation and craftshow do i become rich out of this madness, /biz/?
Sell bed matrasses made of sheep wool, quality does t have to be as good as cloths.Market it as all natural, no chemicals in matrasses causing hormonal problems, no anti-flame chemicals etc.
Sell for higher level price, top.Now pay me for this idea when you becom millionaire.
thats stupid
You have to make small balls of wool to place inside the all-wool mattress.
Use diffrent size/mass of balls for diffrent hardness.Contact bed stores and bed makers, while launchin your own webshop.
