Hey anons.
This is my shitty blockfolio.
I just sold my comic book collection and have $3400 more to invest in crypto.
What should I buy more of?
What should I add?
I’m not looking for short term.
Should I just go all in and split between BTC, BCH and ETH even though they’re expensive right now and hodl?
I know there are some promising alts but I’m not looking for something to risky.
I didn’t hold onto my comics for 30 years just to lose half the value in 2 weeks.
buy your .9 bitcoin you cuck
.9455, jesus i bought 2 btc for all that fiat you got not even 2 months ago
That’s what I was thinking.
Going all in on one full BTC in the hope that it gets to 50 to 500k some day.
Seems like there’s a decent chance of it.
BTC/ETHWTC if you can prevent yourself from looking at your blockfolio for a year.
BTS.
Why are you holding ratios like LINKBTC and LINKETH and NEOETH?I think you have to pay interest on those.
They only exist for short term margin trades.
Don't forget to buy a little LINK while your are at it!
10,000 gets you a lambo..
OMG, just hit a higher low, news in 30 Dec about wallet white label SDK, which is set for realease in Q4 2017.

Havn't seen AMB shilled yet on biz so it might be a good idea to get in early before the moon

Heavily overdiversified.
Why the fuck do you even bother holding .2 of a waltoncoin...
