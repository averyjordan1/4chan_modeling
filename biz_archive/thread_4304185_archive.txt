So is this how big money is manipulating us?This huge fake sell walls that get people to stop buying and start selling, then the person just cancels the order and buys low again?I keep seeing this with Bitcoin cash
Literally.It all started as an argument between a bunch of millionaires over something none of them createdThe market is a fucking over extended joke right now
