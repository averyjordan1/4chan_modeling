Two weeks ago I started using NiceHash while I sleep.
I've made 5 mBTC using it so far.
Last week I got my first Airdrop, 500 TRX.
Shitcoin but whatever.Yesterday just discovered the ARK faucet.
Hell Ya.What other ways are there to get free crypto?
I stream ads on earncrypto when I sleep and on an extra phone during the day for $0.5-$1/day, withdraw it every couple days, been doing it since July.
Was grabbing coins from faucuets but it was too slow, I should try again.
Also grab free ICO coins sometimes.
How do you get free ICO coins?
They just give them out?
Sounds similar to an airdrop?EarnCrypto I'm guessing is an app that shows adds and gives you a bit of crypto for it?
Can you stack phones from the same IP?
I have like 10 extra android devices...
