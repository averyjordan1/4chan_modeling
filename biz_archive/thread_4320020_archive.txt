remember to not put your bch gains into btc if the flippening doesn't happen the next two days.
we will get another chance.
move it into stable or cheap alts.
this will cause btc to keep a relative low marketcap so it is easier to flip them the next time.
probally in about a month or two.
I don't think we will, I've been on BCH train for quite long and it doesn't seem like a reliable alternative to BTC.
Sold my bags, will probably bite my tongue if BCH actually keeps on rising, but I got burned the last time and I'd advice you all to be cautious.
I agree, man.
I will rather take my gains now and let it sit, than risk it all.
The BCH might go to another 2x, but at the same time people might start FOMO hard once BTC will start going to 7k again.
