nothing, just tried.
this happened to me kinda, only in the last few days, i lost 40% of my stack through BCH and slowly rebuilding it back, i still keep tabs on BCH movement and for some odd fucking reason the one sell older that fucked me randomly pops up in the open order section like, when i try to cancel it i get the same message, i close the tab and its gone, but then reappears after a while.this has happened 3 times so far since saturday, Anyone else seen this?, is bittrex just trying to fuck with me?
the little time bittrex allowed me to used there site that did happen to me once.
WHERE IS MY FUCKING LINKITS FUCKING GONE AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
thats fucking weird man, i almost jumped for joy when i seen it was still open but seems to be some sort of ghost order, sorry mate.
AT LEAST YOU WERE ABLE TO HOLD SOME LINK!
BITTREX DIDNT EVEN LET ME HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY aaaAAaaahhhhhHHHHhhh!!
did i do it right?
tell me about me man.
ive search all over the interwebs~ for info about this error and none have any answers.
sounds similar to this, idk if it was resolved thoughwww.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/5zxf7t/bittrex_not_executing_my_orders/
this really makes me want decentralized exchanges to become the norm
Have you tried deleting system32?
Just buy and hold.
Don't keep your money on exchanges.
Use shapeshift so you don't risk your funds on shitty exchanges.
Etherdelta is also safe.
I hear radarrelay is pretty good.
you first
good advice thanks, lets see if bittrex will ever give me back my funds, so i can recover and hold.
