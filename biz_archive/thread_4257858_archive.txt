why don't we just buy 300% ROI masternodes and quit our jobs?
this is how masternode work noobletpeople buy and sell the coin, and the fees give money to stakers and masternodes or something.
The coins that say 300% return have nobody buying them, so it will take you 10 years
>implying 300% returns wouldnt inflate the currency beyond existence
