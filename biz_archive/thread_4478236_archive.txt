How do I cash out BTC without using Tethers?
He didn't prepare a path to fiat exit plan
You can't.
Just put it in ethereum if you want to be somewhat safe.
or you know, transfer to a non scamshit exchange that has never touched tether, and sell them there
Cashing out>TetherI told you fucking morons that any exchange that used USDT and NO fiat trading pairs is going to go up in smoke.You faggots didn't listen.
Is it bad that i don't even know what Tether is?
