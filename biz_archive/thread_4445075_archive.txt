hey /biz/ need your help got to write an assay about social responsible fund's performancenow i need to do the regression with Matlab but im shit in this program i edited the data so i got every factor for the last 16 years in a column vector and every return data for the last 16 years from like 200 funds in a matrix so is there any function in matlab i can use, that just does this shitty time regression for me ?
like "regress(a,ß1,ß2)" or do i have to use a few other functions ?
I know that the picture is from a 4 factor model
Literally just searched it on le internetshttps://www.r-bloggers.com/multiple-factor-model-%E2%80%93-building-risk-model/Also use R, C# or Python for financesSpecially the quantmod R packageRead this for further referencehttps://github.com/wilsonfreitas/awesome-quant/blob/master/README.mdAlso by the nature of your model, it seems that you don't really know how to do stats, try to verify first if all your factors are statistically relevant (i e search for collineality, correlations, copulations, clustering, etc) I guarantee you at least a pair of factors is statistically equivalent
If you find a group of statistically equivalent factors it can be given an interpretation either as an index or as their own market, depending on your context
okay thanks !
our supervisors want us to do it with matlab, and im searching for fame french matlab solutions for a few days but there is no good explanationbut i will read your links anyway to get a better knowledge of stats, causeyou guessed right, i don't really know how to do stats, but the 3 factors were given for each year so there is nothing i can't use im going to create a value weighted portfolio out of these funds (one for funds with high CSR score and one for funds that are "not interested in social responsibility) is there at least a piece of truth in this approach ?
Yep, fairly intuitive, the one with the best return/volatility ratio wins
