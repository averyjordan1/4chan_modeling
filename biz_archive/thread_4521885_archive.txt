I finally got a decent chunk of fiat onto an exchange ($5k).
But the problem now is the price of everything is sky high.
I can't buy BTC, ETH, or Bcash.
What do?
Just hold my cash for a while?
diversify everything in altcoins
But I have to buy a blue chip coin first to transfer to an exchange that sells shitcoins.
BTC holds its value
