Why the fuck isn't Namecoin as revolutionary and amazing as bitcoin.
Why the fuck hasn't it disrupted the whole internet and made conventional DNS fall.
It's a great way to combat censorship and yet there's a small autistic team behind and an angry lead dev that insults a lot of the community (just check the subreddit).Such an amazing technology wasted on an incapable team.
Is there a way to actually get people that want to make it succeed ?
I'm not holding any but I really want to invest and hope it'll be successfull but this fucking socially retarded and low energy team is making it impossible.
REEEEEEEEEE
No one on /biz/ even knows the project.
It was the first fork of bitcoin and the second cryptocurrency ever.
Satoshi was involved.
How sad is that.
Such a failure.
