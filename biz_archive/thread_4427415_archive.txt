I’m a noob, no bully plz.
I’ve only ever bought BTC and ETH.I was wondering about for the buy orders if I put in that I want to buy 1 million tokens, that buy order does not have to be filled all at once correct?
Someone could sell me 100 at that price?Also anyone got any strats to share to buy up tokens?
I put my order down a few listings hoping that the contracts above me expire.
Honestly it kinda felt like I was at an Auction House/Market Board in an MMO.
Pretty comfy.
the buy order will fulfil partially as people sell, it doesn't have to be filled all at once
Thanks!
It depends if there's someone selling enough.
If a you get a sell order for 1000 but you only want 800, that's fine.
