Money is no issue here.
I discussed mining with my friend and he mentioned it to his Dad.
His Dad is very rich and now wants me to come up with some build ideas.He recently bought a new building for a company and has a shit load of free space.
I want your most costly builds with amazing hash rates.
Ether is going away from proof of work to proof of stake.
Btc is an asic miner oligarchy.
If you think ether has a future then buy ether instead of a mining rig and stake it as a validation node for gains.
You will simultaneously get gains for ether price rising too.
Getting rich as a new miner is over.
bitmain antminers
That's what I was thinking as well.
The originally I thought Ether would be easier to mine.
Basically we would use the mined Ether to purchase with and then cash out a portion (pretty dumb I know).
Is this better than just GPU mining
You... Are not seriously asking If ASICs give the miner better results than GPUs?
For Bitcoin mining?
What is this, 2014?ASIC mining is so efficient compared to GPUs that they have totally dominated the hashrate for few years already.
Mining BTC with GPUs is now totally useless since the returns won't come anywhere close to covering Even The electricity bill.
Sorry its the first time I've really heard about it
what is the electricity price
Jump on monero a rig of rx 580's can hash quite a bit and the difficulty is lower than eth.
I just hope you know what you're doing.
Personally I'm building a 6 gpu rig with Rx 560's I'm hoping to hash at least 2 or more kh/s and pull about 800 watts at the wall.
I may throw in a 580 for good measure though.

You're friends Dad is so fucked if he listens to you hahahahaha.
Don't listen to this guy.
All other gpu mined currencies will be flooded with former eth miners after eth goes pos in first half of 2018
