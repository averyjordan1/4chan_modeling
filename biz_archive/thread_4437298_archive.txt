I've always wanted to start a clothing company.
Both as a brand of clothes itself as well as a brick and mortar of the same brand that also sells other brands inside.This seems like a horrible idea when looking at the state of retail.
What other companies can one start for less than a few thousand?
Buy kneepadsGet a cardboard boxSet up at the interstate entrance??

you cant accomplish shit with less than a few thousand unless you're talented
I can start my clothing brand for a few thousand.
Just like I said, retail is in a divebomb right now so it doesn't make much sense to start a new company.
