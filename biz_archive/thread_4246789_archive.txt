I was doing everything right this fork, making gains everywhere with req, mod and komodo.
Until I didn't take profits on mod even when it was up 20%+ I was too lazy to sell some, now I'm down on it.
I knew btc would have a pump soon since I'm mostly in btc and liquidated most my holdings but I didn't have a perfect week...
Komodo is going to plummet in the coming week, get out now like I did
w-why?
Yeah, I learned a lot of lessons during this bitcoin run.
