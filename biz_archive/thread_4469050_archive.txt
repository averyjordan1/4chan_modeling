When the stock market crashes in a couple of years, what happens to crypto values?
The answer is obvious.
All crypto will tank!!!!WOW!!!
It goes upNo one wants to invest in stocks so they put invest money into crypto
With the fiat system it functions via debt.
So people take out loans which creates new money and it needs to be paid back with interest.
This is in effect is the economy on leverage.
As long as the economy is growing the system works but when it contracts there becomes a shortage of fiat.
This means during a contraction there is not enough fiat in the system to pay for current debt payments that are due.
This means fiat becomes extremely deflationary during a contractions as everyone tries to get some to pay their current debt payments.
This would translate in crypto with prices dropping as fiat demand increases.
Btw this boom bust cycle creates a massive wealth transfer and is one the reasons you should reduce your exposure to fiat.
