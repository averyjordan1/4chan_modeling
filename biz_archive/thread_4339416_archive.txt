Here is an email sent from satoshi@vistomail.com in 2015 where satoshi opposes bitcoin XT, a plan to increase block size to 8 MB:https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-August/010238.htmlIt's true that satoshin@gmx.com email and his p2pfoundation email were hacked but this doesn't show signs of being a hack (no ransoms, etc.
).If BCH supporters are more business oriented then they should know that business plans are never followed letter by letter.
Satoshi's whitepaper is 9 years old for god sake, please stop the BS regarding Satoshi's vision.Satoshi wants to see the community cooperating, not fighting.Sell you BCH and let it die.

It is the other email that was a proven fake.
This one has never been proven fake.
It came from the correct server/ip address.
I know its unlikely that its him but he didn't use to sign his messages if I am correct.I think there a small chance that it's him, small enough to stop the Satoshi vision BS.
MONERO is Satoshi's vision manifested
Charlie Lee is Satoshi.
Litecoin is the real vision.
