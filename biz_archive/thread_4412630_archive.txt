I am a newfag into this whole cryptocoin scene.
Is there a way to try to multiply U$65, which is my current balance, fast, even if may end up losing it?
Or do I have to sit and wait and make pennies trading currencies until I deposit more?Pic related.

Your best option is sports betting.
Put $32 on a live bet (game halfway over.
You’ll win $15 approximately.
Do this a few times until you hit $100, then out $50 on some live bets, repeat until you’re betting $200.
