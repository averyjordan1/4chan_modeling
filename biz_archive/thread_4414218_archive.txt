Can you make good money posting/writing articles on steem it?
Or is there a catch
Every post I see has $200+ dollars rewards.
Is this like a bitconnect scam?
If you can build a decent following yes, but the only way to do that rn is to pay bots for upvotes.
Honestly though I think steem is a fuckin goldmine.
Most bots offer anywhere from 1x-3x rewards on what you pay (because they have high voting power upvotes).
You csn make a decent amount off steem through shitposting but obvs if you have good content youre in for a killing.
i think a lot of it is getting lucky and getting a following.
A ton of the trending posts are absolute crap content and they make 100+ dollarsI've made some posts that I've put quite a bit of effort in and I think were pretty good, but they got buried quickly and only earned 7 cents between the two.
I think it takes time though as well, so if you stick with it you might be successful.
You're only looking at the first page, you need to provide good content consistently otherwise you're working for pennies or a few dollars
