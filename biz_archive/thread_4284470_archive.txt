It is so strange seeing Europe with their kings and queens.
Here its the federal government, there its the crown
What?
And wait for the US to get in.
The only thing the feds gate more than an armed populace is one of their subjects tax money being stolen

implying there is a difference other than by name
THE WORLD IS NO LONGER THE WAY IT USED TO BE
TheThe difference is you are ruled (possibly) by one, we are ruled by many.
Easier to overthrow one.
They aren't incorporated in the UK?
ofc we have kings and queens, we have history

There is no culture.

The Queen has the ability to have complete power brainlet
so will this crap finally be gone now or what?
Does this mean anything though?
Can't they just fix the issue and keep going?

So the Queen says "Kill the pajeets", it happens and no one can do anything about it?Don't be silly.
this needs to happen
No it actually can though you idiotShe can override the gov>the prerogative powers have been used less and less though the important thing in our Constitutional Monarchy is that they still exist, they remain a means of protecting democracy in this country ensuring that no one can simply seize power.

TOPKEKfucking great way of reading dates
by one, we are ruled by manythe crown is an abstract entity just like the federal government.
the crown isnt a king or queen, it is the status of king or queen.
Date: 07 Nov 2017I'm not an expert, just did a quick google search and Companies Act 2006 (Section 1000(3)) seems to be something along the lines of a company not giving information like employees, cash, turnover, assets and other paper work to the gov, again, this was reading google for like 5 minutes
