>missed Ripple>missed Link>missed BCHYou're not going to miss this one are you anon?They're converting to an ERC20 token which is huge as it actually makes their token tradable.
They've been low key deving and have solid traction in their space.Literally only raised $1m, this is an easy 10x, market cap is only $2m.
ERC20 TokenYeahhhhh, no thanks.
ERC20 is being use only for trading purpose.
Their gene-chain will be hosted using multi-chain platform.This is one of the most undervalued project out there and as always, /biz/ will miss this one 100% sure.Key selling point:- 45 million token will be locked up, reducing supply to only 55 million from total 100 million- The ICO raised 1 million due to almost no marketing/bounty campaign- Current MC only 2 million- Ph.D team, every dev behind encypgen has Ph.D- They have working product already- They already sold their first node to Codigo46, one of the largest genomic company in Mexico- Basically, if you own your genomic data, you can 'sell' it on the gene market using DNA token.
I am working on genomic industry before and I can guarantee this shit will blow out in the next few years.
/biz/ is for sure going to do the following>Buy high>Sell low
Trying to make /biz/ money is like trying to teach a monkey how to write
so where can we buy this coin?
It's converting to ERC20 on Nov 17th.Probably can still pick it up low key on Etherdelta until it picks up on bigger exchanges
Cryptonext.net but it's the shittiest exchange Ive ever seen.
Worst than yobit so trade at your own risk.
you have not missed Ripple this is a long term one....in fact all cryptos in my opinion are long term!!!
Just finished researching a bit about this coin, all I can say is wow, just wow.
Definitely has 10x potential.
Anyone know what is the ICO price?
?
