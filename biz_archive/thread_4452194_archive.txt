Press F to spit on grave.
2 cents now.
Story?
will it recover at all.... ?
:(
Just bought the 100k of the dip.
Nope, it's over for good.
Whole thing was a scam.
advanced pump and dump that ran way longer than usual.
made people complacent even though there were people up 20x that were almost certainly going to dump once it started trading sideways
So people have failed to take profit once again?
Greedy fcking pajeets
