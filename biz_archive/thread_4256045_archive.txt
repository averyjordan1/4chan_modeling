Hey #BIZ.
Older gentleman here, but still ready to rock and ready to trade.
I heard about Bitcoin 2 not selling well so I went on the Coinmarketcap and the price is really low.Just look at how much the price went down.
It is unbelievable!
So I am thinking I will put all $75,000 of my savings into it for when it recovers.
Just don't tell my wife before we get rich.
LOL!
You're an idiot if you do that
lol
I know this is a joke but there might be people out there who might actually consider this.This is dead guys, it's not at 0 because some people might be sleeping right now idk.Don't buy.
DO IT FAGGOT
4256134Ok I know you Internet boys like to play trolls and pranks, but I am half worried now.
I had bought this before posting and it is still going down even though Bitcoin is going back up.I think I will close my Internet until tomorrow.
Otherwise I might get slippery hands and sell.
Please post proof that you bought 75k worth.
Holy shit
get baited
You're all really dumb.
Bait couldn't be more obvious.
My camera is charging.
Haven't used it since my last company picnic and there is only one battery bar.
LOL!I will post a picture of my account soon, so you boys can analyze the numbers.
I will bookmark this page and read your recommendations before I sell tomorrow.
Go away.
I'm a value investor and I'm finna pump the shit out of this shit.
While I wouldn't make such a trade, desu it's not the worst idea.
Segwit2x is likely just postponed and adopting it is BTC's only chance to not be overtaken by BCH
How can they get away with taking money for a non-existant coin?
This market is nuts.
