https://jdini.com/The total supply is only 65536 (2^16).
That's tiny as fuck, this thing could easily hit $10 like many shitcoins that also have small caps (not as small as JDI though) already have.
Idk how many coins each registrant gets, I imagine it might depend how many sign up.
But even if everyone just gets some measly amount like 5 JDI, that's pretty fucking good since this will easily hit $10 at some point in the future, probably around the time POS goes live in January.You can also buy it on Etherdelta right now although there isn't much of it listed yet, obviously (IIRC the devs are using a bot to list automatically, sort of their way of doing an ICO)Seriously don't sleep on this one, guys.
Coins with this low of a supply don't pop up often.
Because nobody gives a fuck.
Any toddler could shit out a 10 supply token.
Doesnt make it worth shit.
this just reeks of pajeet
Yeah in case you're new, almost every coin is "worthless", that doesn't mean you can't make money off them anyway.
Look at fucking Eth Gold, ZCash Gold, Mercury, etc.
etc.
All pumped sky high despite being absolutely pointless.
Only now you can have a relatively large portion of a pointless coin and therefore more more $$$
What stops me from signing up 100 times with 100 different names/emails/eth addresses?
I haven't ever seen a coin shilled here that looked this scamlike before.
That whitepaper is something to behold.
