Well, the fact that all the people spreading FUD on REQ have to resort to idiotic insubstantial posts like this makes me feel quite comfy.
Still don't get the purpose of this post?
There has always been idiots in crypto.
Whats your point anon?
There isn't one.OP found someone who went all-in on a coin (REQ), and only started in crypto a few months ago.
Based on this, he thinks it is time to dump REQ.
What an idiot.
As if some noob going all-in on REQ changes the fundamental business proposition in any way.
Seeeeeelllllll
Glad i am not the only one who doesn't find anything useful in this shitpost.>Someone sold his fcking house in 2015 and went all in bitcoin.
Remember the good old reddit posts.
