I wouldn't even be pissed if I lost all my investment in crypto ($10000).
The shit I've learned along the way has been priceless and no fucking retarded uni course could ever teach you the stuff you learn here.
Thanks /biz for the lessons in survival.
Same here, but I've learned how to get it back.
Now I'm just waiting.
gib some spicy tips then faggot
Buy high sell low
what do we learn here OP?
that the pajeet is a very bad man?
I wouldn't be mad if I lost 10k either because I already made 100$ into 50k and the rest would keep making gains
when you put it that way yeah..
I could see myself becoming a top tier trader in my older years based on everything I learned this year
you made 500x homie?
i made many x less than that and my initial investment just fucking eats at me, ive made good money yet its fucking depressing.
is this greed?
ive made good money yet its fucking depressing.
is this greed?yes
When I first started I yolo'd in with no experience with $3,500.
Ended up with a 22% loss a month in.
I learned valuable lessons and I've made over 300% returns on my initial investment after learning the ropes.
I'm only being eaten by the hypotethical fact of how much I could have potentially made if I put in more money in the first place but there's no point delving in the what was and what could have been as it will never be reality
i don't want to be greedy, i just feel like i took such a huge opportunity too lightly, i put in a lot less than i could afford to lose
