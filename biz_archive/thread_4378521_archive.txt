Why is GVT going to be biggest gainer of month?Extremely low market cap.
I heard about this project months ago and there was a lot of hype prior to ICO.
I thought it would sell out quickly and I didn't want to take part in it.
When I found out a week ago that it raised a little more than 2 million$ I couldn't believe it.
Later I found out that they had a little problems with marketing and then after a first week or two they said that they have enough funds to build what they need, and they are going to earn money by making their app extremely profitable for both them and investors.GVT with current market cap of 3 million will be somewhere around ~380th place on coinmarketcap.Top 250: 320% profitTop 150: 860% profitTop 100: 1500% profitThat is how undervalued GVT is.
I personally think that GVT will be one of the most popular projects in our community in months to come, and that would put it way way higher in top 100, but I will be happy with whatever happens.
It is up to team to deliver and I have no doubts in them.
