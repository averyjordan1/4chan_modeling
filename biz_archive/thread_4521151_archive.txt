Just bought some AE on liqui.io and noticed that there's a 10AE withdrawal fee!
How the heck is this possible?
Can I get it somewhere for lower?
bumping until someone answers
4521208Don't withdraw.
It not going far anyway.
I just exchanged back to LTC and tried to withdraw.
The withdrawal button is loading for 10 minutes already.
Terrible exchange.
