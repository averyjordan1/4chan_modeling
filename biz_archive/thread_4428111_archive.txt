after working as an intern at a national bank for almost a year now, i learned 1 important thing that i'll never ever forget:95% of workers have absolutely no fucking clue, about anything.i am seriously amazed that banks like this can generate this ginormous amount of profit.who else is convinced of their own abilities and skill to make big cash while founding (a) future startup(s)?
What matters is that the top 10% knows what they're doing and the grunts are somewhat implementing it and everything is gonna be fine.
Welcome to the real world.
Everyone has this realisation at some point - that nobody really understands the world and we're all just making it up as we go
