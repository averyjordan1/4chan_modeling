Hello, bitch bastirds.
I have decided to give you an early Christmas present.
There are two coins you need to buy before the end of this year.
Link and Nuls.
Both should 5x at least.
That is all my children.
Link I understand, but why nuls?
It will have similar development as WTC.
Confusion in western markets.
Then improved communication and news that will make it boom.
There will be fud and price plunges similar to how Walton went from 1.90 to .80 in its early days.
Maybe the fud and plunge is over.
I would buy while it’s under a dollar.
OP: "buy link">me: "okay, based on what premise?
Why will it rise in value?>OP: "REEEEEEEE MUMMY SAID IT WOULD GO UP"
Anyone who does not buy link will be kicking themselves.
Was it shilled?
Yes.
Are there delusional linkies?
Yes.
In my mind, due to the partnerships and recognition link has received from HLC and SIBOS this is a no brainer.
Do yourself a favor and pick up at least 5k.
You might be able to get it at 12-14 cents in the short term.
Just be watching for news so you don’t miss the boat.
