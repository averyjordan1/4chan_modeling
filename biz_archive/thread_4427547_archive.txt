A trend seems to be forming.Isn't the lower oscillation of the BCH DARI line slowly crossing the upper oscillation of the BTC DARI line?
Or to be less subtle, isn't this effectively BIG WARNING, small warning, small warning, small warning?
Just look at the 7d average.
BCH keeps beeing a lot more profitable.
BTC isnÂ´t dying as fast as people said but from now on there will always be stuck transactions
If that BCH DARI line never goes below the BTC DARI line again...
I will be very surprised if it's just "some stuck transactions".
