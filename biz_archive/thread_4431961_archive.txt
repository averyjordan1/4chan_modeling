Guys i think a breakout is happening on strat just now.
Wait wtf, $3.50?

Bitcoin surge + retards expecting things to go straight to mainnet, not testing it at testnet first.

Seriously, stop buying this coin.
It's the flavor of the month in July and there's literally no news, nothing coming out, and nobody cares.
Not even meme-ing, Stratis is garbage
I asked if there was a breakout, not a fucking pajeet to tell us to go all in as per every other thread.
good thankyou, given what i saw... thought there was a sniff of something we are not privvy to.
