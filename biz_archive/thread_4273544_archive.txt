From this medium article:"Note, that RDN tokens are not necessary at the core of the Raiden Network Protocol and in theory anyone can use the Raiden Network without having RDN tokens.
That said, our assumption is, that most participants in the Raiden Network will be light clients which are happy to pay small fees for the comfort of not having to run all required auxiliary services themselves 24/7.

This token IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE THE NETWORK!
This was an ICO to get money.
Now your are driving up the price on a USELESS token.
Enjoy your bags when the next shiny new token gets added to Binance tonight.
Nobody cares desu.
I know that nobody cares right now because it is mooning only because it is new.
Just warning people not to get stuck with bags when they next new coin is listed on Binance.
