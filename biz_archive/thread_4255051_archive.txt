I missed the B2X cancellation and alt resurgence by about an hour.
WTF should I do now, keep hodling BTC and hope for 8000 or jump into some alts?
Shill me some alts that still have room to grow please.
ARK and NEO my nigga
ZEN and XMR my nigga
Yes OP, remember to buy high and sell low.
You missed the rocket.
Accept it.
Wait for correction and buy the dip.
Stop fighting the ZEC moon.
Just lie back and accept the gains.
$NULs, the chinks are still waking up and buying it.
POWR and XVG my nigga
Go all in on Ark.
BUY QTUM

unironically this
ark
VTC, just wait for it to dip a bit more
thanks mate
Get the fuck in REQ.
It still hasn't mooned yet
Are you me?
Will it even?
No, the alt market is dead.
The only gainers left are the ones that are already established and have already risen in price substantially.
What can I say?
This one here is a hidden gem.
