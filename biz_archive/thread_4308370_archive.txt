you still have a chance to get in around 31-35k.the small dip will continue until we approach the mean price level one more time.
Notice that the 30d MA (green) is dipping under the 90d (red) (TK crossover), while senkou span B (pink) is intersecting the current price level.
These are, medium-term, bullish signals.
However, I believe that the next two candles at least, shall be red, as we appear to be at the apex of a bearish fractal, and for the indicators that I will follow up this post with.
MACD, Stocachastic Momentum Index, and Schaff all point to short term overbuying a small pullback, reinforcing the fractal shape and volume shrinkage.Price prediction: Sub 35k within the next two days, followed by the next leg up in the impending bullrun
bump for opinions
order book looks intimidating to try sell and rebuy lower.
i imagine this doesnt matter much though but if your prediction turns out right ill buy another bag load of this coin
How high on this bull run will she go in your opinion?

Hoping it dips a bit lower so I can drop my ETH into it.Fuck off
I'm all in on ark, I finally did it.
I put $20k into it...
That's a little harder to predict but I think that 75k is a realistic short-mid term goal.after that, we'll see.
It really just depends on volume.
That's not as promising as I hoped it would be.
These things happen in stages and ark will have to test some milestones before it really booms.Feel free to disagree with my interpretation.
It will pay off.
If it makes you feel any better, I have $45k in it.
lol I'm in about 40k.
Kind of crazy I think you guys are telling the truth since this is an anonymous forum
