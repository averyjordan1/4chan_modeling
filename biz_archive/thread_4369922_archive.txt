Will it ever overtake ETH?
no just ripple in the next 72 hours.
Koreans are pumping it tonight.
Been reading about the gooks pumping ltc tonight, reminds me of bch prepump.
Where are you guys getting this information from?
D.va discord.
They pumped during BCH and then dumped exactly at 2100.
4370756Pure speculation, but realistically would would a BCH level pump do to LTC, surely it couldn't do an x8 like BCH, though if it does, and with accessibility to buy LTC for Norman, this could be very big if true.
Thought D.va was a meme.Well, I’m holding 9 LTC since 60.9, hoping for some nice gainz
.5 since 62 here myself.
Hoping I'm not gonna get meme'd on
May kek bless our investment
off by 1
It’s over AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
be patient, hong kong noon just passed
Regardless of any pump and dump shenanigans there's potential for a kumo crossover on the 1 hr chart
And a breakout on the 6 hour
 is 6 hours from now?
