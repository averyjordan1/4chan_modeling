Crypto, which is just now emerging into the real world, is just going to trade sideways from now on?
Really anon?
big things to come in 2018 you just have to pick the right ones right now.REQ btw
Yeah definitely not req.
Expect xrp sys florin to go up when they hit mainstream in 2018.
Not sideways but 10000% gains?
If you got in crypto in June, many have seen nothing but losses.
People bought OMG at $12, NEO at $50, Chainlink at $0.49
How much more?
XRP was one of the moonshots, how much juice is left?
We just had some rocky as fuck months dude, massive FUD, bitcoin civil wars, forks, which the crypto market survived relatively easily2018 will be huge for crypto

I didn't properly start until 2017.
I wish I was a bit more serious about this in 2016, but I was too busy watching the election spectacle.
I hope so.
This year hasnâ€™t been kind for gains when the forks started
>tfw got into crypto in the last 3 monthsI guess I should be happy I basically got alts on sale.
