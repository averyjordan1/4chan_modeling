CME futures will be for BITCOIN, NOT BCH.
This is just a pump by Roger, Jihad, and the miner cartels to try to give BCH some credibility.
Institutional money will move into BITCOIN, don't hold this shitty alt and get cucked by the King once again, surely /biz/ has learned it's lesson.
what fututres are we talking about?

ok thanks, I thought "futures" means forks, and was like wtf, that's actually a pretty interesting concept
No, he literally means new institutional money flowing into BTC ... and its not going to go into BCH
In the short them they are winning.
Long run they will get burnt.Would be careful holding btc here.
I'm waiting until 5000-5400 to step back in.
