>ANNOUNCEMENT: After consulting with our community we have decided to keep our portion of CFD tokens locked indefinitely.
This means that the 4.5 million CFD we currently hold will never enter circulation.
We have chosen to do this as we have no intention to sell, and we are still able to receive our portion of the revenue whilst they are locked.Wow
I fucking love these guys, so happy I bought some yesterday.
i'm so ready for this.
That's the Comfydo difference!
Current circulating supply is still 9 million so is not like groundbreaking news.
Good for the future though.
Show confidence since they won't just dump at us.
lmao no source, clearly fake and gay.
why the fuck would devs permanently tie their hands
Gtfo
It's been confirmed on telegram, saw it.
You can belive us or just stay poor.
what is reading comprehensionThey're not permanently tying their hands, they're still going to make ridiculous bank from the dividends when the platform goes live
Post an actual source and I’ll consider buying some.I’ll wait.
