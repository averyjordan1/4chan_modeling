Some comedian Louis CK would ask women if they want to see him masturbate, and when they would try to say no, he would interupt by repeating "huh huh huh" while whipping it out to masturbate furiously.
When they would try to leave, he'd block the exit and demand to be paid in Bitcoin Cash.
With such an endorsement from a beloved comedian, its really fucking the market up now.
This is fucking bad... and worst of all i don't understand wtf is happening, btc is stagnant, alts crashing, btch going into the sky... and i am stuck bagholding until further notice
Bitcoin cash is takin over anon and Rome is burning as we play our harps

I'm seriously considering all 10 of my BTC into BCC right now.
With 2x cancelled, BTC has a massive scaleability problem that's getting worse by the day.
BCC is the only solution on the table right now.
Bill Cosby used to slip hallucinatory drugs into women's drinks and harangue them about the benefits of cryptocurrencies for the global economic system before forcibly having sex with them.
The affected women now have a negative association connected to crypto and have repeatedly talked about it during Bill Cosby's court proceedings.
The media are now bringing these negative associations to light.
Bitcoin Cash taking over.
But why the fuck would this escalate in a matter of hours, this shit has been known for ages... nothing new...I bett miners are switching to btcash for the difficulty scaling, it's gonna fuck btch-s shit up big league.
Then they gonna switch back to btc
