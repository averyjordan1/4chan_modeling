No shill from either side plz.
Is this actually happening?
of course not.
Happening right now
ETH is going to overtake BTC.
That's the true redpill so you should just buy as much ETH as possible now and wait.
Remember that segwit2x larp after the fork got cancelled?
Did any major FUD campaign ever have some bad longterm effect on BTC?
That's your answer.
Yes.
You think ETH's pump was random?Nope, Ethereum has joined the battle to kill the Bitcoin.
it's a fallacy to believe that the same result will be had every time.
It would also be considered fairly delusional.
thank the cashiers for shaking loose some weakhands off btc and buy more while it's dipping.
when btc hits 10k before christmas you'll look back on this and wonder why you were ever worriedor you can jump in on bch and get left holding bags when it dumps again.
your choice.
eth is not even a currency bro
Neither is bitcoin.
