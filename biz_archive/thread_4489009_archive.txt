Anyone who predicts BTC's price is full of shit.No one knows what could happen and never will.It could go down to $100 tomorrow or up to $100,000.Just sit back and hold.
Stop listening to these morons.

Should i invest 1k$ in bitcoin right now?
I'm a poorfag from 3rd world country, my salary is around 900$.
I think about investing 60% of my salary every month.
yes.
it is going nowhere but up.
don't let these shills sway you to their shitcoins.
institutional money (banks) are lining up to get into the market and that will be possible for them very soon.
just buy on a schedule as much as you can
60k BTC if 0.5% of the total circulating invested money goes into crypto?Is this accurate?
If so I might sell my kidney right now.
honest opinion; not if you have nothing on the side.
You don't want to be in a situation where you need to cash out fast some Ks because your boiler or AC died.
Never gamble with more than you can lose.
we are in the final stages before true liftoff.
people haven't seen anything yet
LOL not accurate.
