>there exists people here on this board right now who own 0 (ZERO) BTC
tfw own 0.00469136 BTC
*BCH shilling*
I been in and out of BTC more than wit your mom
How much bitcoin do I need to make it one day?
anon, always 21
When can I buy back in?
I dumped my BTC bag at 7500 (3.0 BTC).
Had a standing sell order in w/ Gemini (I’m not at my PC or phone 24/7 like /biz seems to be).
Was really happy about it too until I saw it nip at 8K the same day.
So now I have 22 grand sitting in Gemini, when the fuck can I buy back in?
Do I eat it and buy back in now at 7650?
Or is this going to come back down below 7K and give me a chance to get back in before we 10K by New Years Day??
there are people on this board right now who will hold corecoin into the difficulty adjustment and have their funds frozen forever in chain death
its going to either mid 8's-9k or to sub 5k over the next weekguess which is more likely with CME coming in soon, and coinbase announcing custodial services, and ETFs on the horizon, and normies catching wind, and BCH being exposed, and...
I already did the obligatory BCH shill post anon you don't need to
You’re saying I should buy back in now at 7657 ish or whatever it is.
Gonna wait and see what it looks like about 16 hours from now and make the call.
Thx
BCH being exposed?
The only time I've ever had BTC is from a nicehash payout, then I converted it to ETH
then help me?
