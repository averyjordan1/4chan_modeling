>Daily reminder that 90% of the ''pump and dump'' groups are scams.>Daily reminder that pajeet subhumans are promoting them on /biz/>Daily reminder that the 'whales' in the group already pre-bought the coin over the course of the several days and will dump it the moment they ''announce'' it in the group.
It will dump so fast that all the normies in pump group (who are still buying) are left with the bags while the whales made profit.Don't fall for the pajeet roach scam.
BigPump is worst of them all, not a single one of their pumps ever succeeded.
i agree but how can i as a brainlet tread carefully my friend?
it is successful for the selected few.
The whales behind the scenes.
Simpel, the real reliable pump and dump groups are very exclusieve and you can't join them.
It's very hard.They are filled with rich crypto people that have a high sense of integrity.
Because that is what the P&D group needs for most members to make a profit.Integrity.
also, don't fall for the ''Pay 0.5 btc to join our exclusive group'' scams.Many reliable pump and dump groups are filled with people that know eachother in real life.Business network etc.
