Can someone give me a quick rundown on bitconnect?
I know nothing about it other than "ponzi".
They have a miracle trading bot that prints money.
Refer all your friends to make even more money!
Oh.
Well then.
Well, the way they do it is that they dont pay their users out in USD, they pay it with the bitconnect token.
Which they premined themselves a lot of.
When they pay people, they dont really lose anything because all they pay out is useless BCC.
People have to sell their btc to bitconnect for BCC to lend it and they only get payed with BCC.
So for now it is a good deal.
Buy and lend 10BCC to bitconnect and get 15BCC back in a month.
But the thing is, the only thing giving BCC its value is people buying it to lend it to make more.
Unlike other tokens that have a use, bcc literally does nothing.
So when that bubble bursts BCC will go to zero.
What does the Bitconnect team end up with?
Everyone's BTC while the users have useless BCC tokens.
I see.
Gonna be fun watching it collapse.
