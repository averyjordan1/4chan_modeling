God etherdelta is such a piece of shit
learn the concepts brainlet
I understand the concepts, doesn't make it any less shitty.
Look at the pic, it's been that way for 15 minutes and hasn't updated.
Every single buy order I try to fill get's rejected because it was already filled.
Please enlighten me as to what concepts I haven't learned
Oh i get it, Confido just died 10 minutes after I made the decision to sell at a reasonable profit.
Fuck me.
