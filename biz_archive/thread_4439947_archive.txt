>tfw you realize you wasted thousands of hours on 4chan and videogames Instead of doing something productive
No, you didn't waste shit.what you're wasting is your stupid fucking thought thinking about the time you're spending wasting.
GET THE FUCK OFF HERE AND DO SOMETHING OR ACCEPT YOUR MEDIOCRITY
Easy for you to say normie
lmao, normie.normie to who?
you?
because you can argue your life is worse?unless you're mentally retarded or crippled.
the rest of your life is a conglomeration of your choices.Even ugly dudes can work out and get hot chicks, and get rich and do all that shit.
Implying thereâ€™s anything productive you could do
This is one of the few boards you might actually find something productive to do.
>not coming here to shitpost and get out your emotions after a long productive day of accomplishmentsIf you're not doing this, you're retarded.
Fuck man youre right.
Im going to uninstall 4chan.
I dont want to waste my time here anymore, can you give me more advice before I go please
Bump
instead of feeling down for wasting so much time, either waste time doing something you love or do something productive AS FAST AS YOU CAN before getting back to doing what you love.
Yes but how can I stay focused?
How can I develop willpower
If it bothers you, then stop it and become productive.If it doesn't, then continue being a slob.Or maybe you feel like it should bother you and the fact it doesn't bothers you bothers you, then kill yourself you retarded social-whore normie.
Stop fapping.
you don't, you never will.... guilt and stress are your willpower.Obligations and deadlines your necessity.
I wish i had discovered biz earlier.
I wasted hundreds of hours on r9k and sp for years.
Had i discovered crypto earlier, my life could have been much different.
Creating external pressures to do things is a good way if you are naturally lazy but don't like letting people down/having a tangible trace of your laziness be around.-One of the simplest way is simply listing thing you want to do tomorrow on your agenda.Start small, and add more and more tasks as you accustom yourself to being productive.-You could tie the work you want to do in a public way, like for example upload a video on youtube of you doing/talking about the productive activity you want to do, so at least for the duration of the video you'll do it.-Start a business with real money.
Letting your investment rot and wither is a great motivator to work.-If you have some wealth already, consider hiring an assistant, whose job is basically berating you each time you procrastinate.
Basically hiring a nagging wife.-Speaking of a wife, the stereotype of the nagging wife is actually hard to find since they started working and are basically all riding the cock carousel.
Most women actually are avoiding confrontations and just fleeing at the first sign of trouble, but if you can find a nagging wife, it would be a great motivator.-just b urself
