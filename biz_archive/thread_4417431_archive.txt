Do you set sell orders even on your HODL coins?
I feel like even for a coin I believe in and want to keep long-term, if it 100% moons while I'm sleeping, I'd rather cash out and buy back in after it retraces.Is that smart or am I just going to miss out on more moonage on average?
If it's smart, what do you set your sell limits at - +50%, 75%, 100%?
