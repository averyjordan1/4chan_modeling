*loses everything*
I was just thinking about that cuck.
Wonder what he's doing.
Maybe he has diversified.
i wanna punch this faggot in his smug facenot even mad about the rich part, just has punchable face
Doubt it.
He seems like a smart guy probably has some other guy giving him advices how to avoid shit like this and probably sold at portions
Freaking out on twitter by the looks of it
kek poor kid
Delusional.
He went into hyper-shill mode.
Hahaha
Oh boy he is about to get rekt.
It's funny last night I was watching a youtube video from October where this guy who has been in crypto for years was bragging about how BCH was garbage and the only good thing about it was selling it all for more BTC at 0.1.
RIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Feel bad for him, honestly.
Hopefully the coming events will instill some humility into him.
How can you feel bad for him, hes richer than probably anyone else on this board and he's still going to be rich regardless what happens.Feel bad for my sorry ass and all the other people that are 100% in alt coins since november
Don't, he's a huge faggot.
He started some subreddit with shitty cringe-tier memes dedicated to how great he is and how he's smarter than everyone
lel nice one
I hope he actually does
