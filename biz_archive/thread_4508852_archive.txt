dont miss some decent gains
Just FOMO'D am I fucked
Don't worry - you've just invested in the true king
The order book is looking juicy right now... think I made a good call.
The growth is all organic - this isn't a pump but a market revaluation
There's a shitload of tiny orders coming in... wtf?
we will see a correction but it's okay.
This is a solid long term hold.
I've been buying since $85; and even bought last night at $147, and again today at $158.
XMR will get you through the drama
I have faith, of course resistance is to be expected at 0.02 btc
The sleeping giant has awoken!
The trading bots are swarming in.
I put all my crypto money (115k USD) in XMR at 180k.
this feels like cocaine but I gain money instead of spending it.
Holy shit man.Major congrats.
How much/when did you start?
I only haz tiny 12k from 5k since July.
WTC and VTC made me most of gains because I was stupid and didn't but enough BTC like most fags on here.I had 10 XMR back when it was $48 and sold thinking it wasn't going to be shit.
I've seen the light now and trading all my alt gains and original investments for XMR.
