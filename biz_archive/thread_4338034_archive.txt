Why is buying crypto so difficult and confusing?The numbers, what do they mean?
Why wouldn't I click the smallest number?
probably one of the easiest charts, or you this dumb?
Buyers want to have bids below the last price, sellers above.
The 0.1 10 and 100 BTC give information about how many BTC are on the market that can be bought and sold
So Why wouldn't I buy the smallest orange one?
Why do people bother with the Big Orange Values?
because it means people want to sell it for that much means when all little values are bought out the big numbers become liitle number understand?
but why would you buy from the big values
because dumb and typed the wrong number or because its faster and more reliable
its a queue you idiot
>normies can't understand a simple order bookThis is why we need a Robinhood mobile app but for crypto.
Because it'll automatically buy the cheapest ones available on the orderbook at that moment.
The price you're entering is a LIMIT on the amount you're willing to pay.
That's why it says Order type: limit.
If there's not enough coins under or at your limit price, the remaining coins will turn into a buy order in the orderbook that other people can sell into.
there isn't many available at little numbers, maybe you want more right now so you buy everyones from little to big, this will become much more apparent to you if you are trying to buy low volume coins, this is liquidity
