I'm surprised that there isn't a blacklist yet of companies to avoid working for.
Glassdoor is basically shills galore as every company gets 3 stars on average.Can we get a thread going on /biz/ for this?
For small companies it probably doesnâ€™t make any sense to talk about them here, since no one else will have heard of them.For big companies, work quality probably depends a whole lot on location.
I work at a diner near in a quiet college town, here are pros> free food> flexible hours (if you are a student)> free food> and some of the mexican cooks can hook you up with weed if you are into that> free food> new ,cute girls aged 19-21 y/o work here every season or so> if you're around their age, you could probably hook up with themcons> you are working at a diner> can't check /biz/ and refresh blockfolio every minute
>getting out of bed>putting on a crumpled suit or coveralls or uniform>commuting>sitting at a desk or in front of some grease stained machine or in the rain for 8-10 hrs per day>repeating until you drop dead or replaced by pajeet or juan or burgflip 9000
glassdoor is useless because buttblasted wagecucks always rate 1 star and hr shills 5 stars.
they balance each other so each company gets a three
LOL!
