So yeah I got scammed into buying this shitcoin @ 4 satoshi on hitbtc.You know whats funny though?Hitbtc only trades in increases of 1 satoshi, and because I am forced to hold this shitcoin.My investment of 1 bitcoin actually increased with the mooning which btw had these 2 months.I actually made fucking 40% profit while the net value decreased.What the fuckidy fuck?My only gains in investing is this russian scam force hold?REEEEEEEE
