Let me shill you guys a cool project that's under the radar right now.
It's WeTrust, the coin is TRST (Don't confuse it with TRUST!)
It's going to be a "decentralized financial services platform created to provide an intuitive and global alternative to the traditional financial services provided by banking institutions.
WeTrust provides financial services through reciprocal aid models like ROSCA, allowing individuals to be both lenders and borrowers."
What is ROSCA?
"ROSCA stands for Rotating Savings and Credit Association, and is a form of reciprocal aid.
Itâ€™s a mutual lending platform that allows the user to both save and borrow funds, depending on the situation.
A ROSCA acts as a simultaneous peer-to-peer banking and peer-to-peer lending service, and is most commonly used in developing countries where financial exclusion is prevalent."
