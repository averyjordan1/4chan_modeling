>down 30% on astro and hstAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!
Do i sell?
Basically everything is down, we're in a fucking nasty bear market right now.
Just hold I guess unless you know of something better to put that money into.
Not Astro.
Dividends are going to be released early December and there may be a token burn coming up.
If there is no token burn, you will be airdropped a porportional amount of Astro.
Before that we might also get listed on a big exchange so really just wait for now, which is easier said then done.
