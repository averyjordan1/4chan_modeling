LMFAO YOU BOUGHT ATH!!!!
Hail to the King, baby
thanks for buying my bags at 2,500, sold at ath and got back into the real coin, bitcoin
Fuck this market, I'm cashing out my profits.
Whether it goes up or down is none of my business anymore.
This.
Sold 81 bch at top.
Get recked scrub
Buy walls are back up.
It's stabilizing at 1500 area.
Will be easier for the whales to buy out BCH from circulation now that it's so low in price.Bithumb is also back up too.If you sold at 2500, good job.
You get to buy back in now and get even more gains.
