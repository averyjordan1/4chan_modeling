when is it going to recover
yesterday
Maybe 2 years, but with Sergey's lack of shill skills probably never.
Partnership or exchange news.
Exchange news is unlikely but will bring it back a bit.
Partnership news will drive it to ATH but won't be coming for a little while, because it will take time to get the oracle network up and running.
Is this satire?
Hasn't found a floor yet im fairly sure it will touch ico prices if no kew exchange is announced within a week
never ever.
EVER.how many fucking partnerships does this shitcoin need?
Some huge fucking partnerships were announced during SIBOS yet all it did was stagnate and then tank.
It's hard to imagine bigger partnerships than those, by the way.
JP Morgan, Sony, I mean, come on.
What the fuck else are you expecting?
its a fucking json parser backed by an erc20 token shitcoin.there are already better oracles going to ico soon.its worthless
Is this satire?
?never ever.
EVER.why notits worthlesswhat do u mean by this
ive invested literally my life's savings into this.
Please tell me this isn't just another shitcoin.
I have barely $100 left in my bank account.
i mean its already had its pump and now its value will slowly go to zero

?You're making the same thread everyday at this point I think you're a nolinker making fun of linkers.
Is the pic going around of him looking like he's 350+ lb for real?
has to spell chainlink different to bypass the filters.
Fucking kill yourself
How much LINK do I need to /make it/?
Got enough for about 40k right now but Iâ€™d be more comfy with at least 60k.
Probably when they fucking have something to show?Why does everyone want LINK and REQ to moon when they don't even have a product yet?
I just got 50k and am feeling comfy
What partnerships were announced during sibos?
Because people bought into the hype without even understanding the technology the token is supposed to support.
This shitcoin is kill, NEXT
