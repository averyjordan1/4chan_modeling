Great team.
CEO is in FORBES.
Token came out during prime FUD time and is now 75% under ICO.. Don't let it moon 10x before you buy in.
Been holding this shit for months, hasnt moved at all.
I do think it's comparatively undervalued and they are expecting two larger exchanges to be signed by the end of December or earlier.
It's pretty cool that the CEO made Forbes 30 Under 30 List.
Market cap already over 6 millionewwie ewwie ewwie get it away
