Sell all your kmd right now, this shit is going to crash hard.
pathetic FUD
he bough at 60k
Nigger what, 30k sats is a great buy for this.
Zoom out, look at the one month chart, or the 3 month, This baby is ready for a pump to 40k sats.
But now and wait for your 30% gains.
Long term its a great project too, but lets be honest, /biz/ is just here to make money.
Komodo had a bad rep from delaying the ICO, I took this chance to buy it cheap under its current price right now.
If you've seen their current tweets they've been working hard on their BarterDEX application, adding additional features and functions.
This hasen't been reconigzed yet and once people pick up on this it will naturally rise in price.
Remember buy low you retards.
Not wait until it goes high then buy
AHHHHHHH
oh still held onto your komodo?
Woulda sold by now if I was so much up
Komodo had a bad repAnd you can't get rid of it.
It's dying.
