Whats happening with bitcoin gold.it launched at hammers to the moon them sharply dropped to less than its opening price.is it dead?is it going to recover?
Bitcoin Cash did a pretty similar thing if you look at its chart.
It'll probably make a resurgance in around 6 to 12 months.
It was a scam pre-mine with pretty much zero use, whad you expect.
buy a thinking of buying a few and sitting on them.
Here's the scenario I'm envisioning sometime in 2018>Fuck we are sick of this BTC/BCH civil war shit, fucking centralized miners fucking with our alts>Hey, remember when BTG was made?
It runs on Equihash algorithm so it's somewhat ASIC resistant and decentralized, lets go there to get away from this bullshit>BTG moons for a few days>People realize that BTC is still king and BCH is a chinese scam and sell back into BTC
yea i thinking this aswell.might possibly go up to a bitcoin cash ratethats a hefty profit
Bitcoin cash had shitty devs, but at least better marketing.Bitcoin gold has literally the worst devs (except for segwit2X lol) and barely any marketingThe devs own like 1 million BTG, and they will dump at any time.
I dumped mine as soon as I could, and couldn't be happier with my extra .1 BTC I made
BitcoinZ is superior
* is superior
