Can I get a quick rundown?
Been considering buying into this because of a post I read but I haven't had the time to properly research it
its a scam dont buy go away
bought for $1k now please tell me what i bought
Its a mineable coin, uses the Equihash algorithm.
It becoming an ICO platform like NEO ETH etc.
but with Privacy features and they have an application in development and is working called BarterDEX which does atomicswaps, most people don't even know about this application because they don't really know komodo.
Atomicswaps its a new thing and LTC pumped because of this, Komodo didn't because almost no one knows yet.
Just buy it low and wait in hiding until it rallies.
Thanks senpai, I will look into it further
