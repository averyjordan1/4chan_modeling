If you absolutely must smoke to deal with the stress, roll your own from tobacco pouches.
They last 3x longer and are 0.6 the price.
use that money to buy shitcoins instead, loser.
buy some MTL.
theres plenty of alternatives to smoking if your a fag and low testsnus is the best alternativevapes and other le pharmaceutical nicotine alternatives are reserved for homosexyou might as well smoke
$ a week, that's more 1 year of work for poor africans.
Haha u are me years agoAddiction is a bitch.
First, stop buying the packs.
If you have a lot nearby that's too much.
When I would Jones I would have to go a couple miles to a convenience store.
I'd buy a single, take a few puffs feel disgusted and crush it under footI succeeded by mentally remembering the times I did not smoke and did not feel the urge.
I started lifting weights, eating healthy, drinking coffee, rode a bike everywhere.
Going on 10 minute runs when I had urges, eventually going longer.
Walks, reading, any kind of distraction.Don't give up!
It's all mental.
Focus on the way you feel.
You are doing good for yourself.
And last, don't beat yourself up to much.
It took about 3 months to get to place where I hardly ever had the urge.
Today I never even think about it.
You have to hate the cigarette.
You have to recognize it is your enemy!
Cancer took my best friend last year.
You are dodging bullets never forget!
If you still cannot do it you might want to look up Alan Carr's book about stopping smoking...
