This shit is better than any drama, exciting times!And best of all, in case BCH somehow would overtake BTC, I can always trade 1 : 1 on exchange just in time.
So, nothing can go wrong :)
 please please please
please daddy
It's going down to 4k.
>bull trap
BTC it's going up because people taking profits in BCH using bch/btc pair... BTC will drop more...
just in timeBetter do it a little bit before.
If BCH actually starts to near BTCs marketcap, a lot of Bitcoiners are suddenly going to jump the ship all at the same time.
It could be a matter of hours and you might be sleeping at the time
Good point, that is definitely good way to look at it
Better do it a little bit beforeYeah, actually makes sense.
If it approaches closesly, it would signal to others the inevitable.
Thanks for the advice!
Dead cat bounce.
Hash rate plummeting.
