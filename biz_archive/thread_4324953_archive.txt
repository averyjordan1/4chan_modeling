In 2014, Mt.
Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange in the world, filed for bankruptcy.
At the time, Japanese creditors requested Mt.
Gox to return the equivalent amount of their funds stored in bitcoin in Japanese yen.
Since then, the price of bitcoin has risen by 70-fold, and former Mt.
Gox CEO Mark Karpeles is expected to take the majority of the profit from the bankruptcy proceedings.
