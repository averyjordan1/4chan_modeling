I'm here mining $8 a day with a fucking r9 390.Welcome back to the GPU mining holy land children.
I have an old amd GPU, will I be able to mine?
BASEDKeep cracking at that backlog
What software are you using to mine?
Nicehash, it's an easy plug and play application that pays you in BTC to a specified wallet.
I've had it running non stop since May.
I've made an easy couple hundred desu.
What coin are you mining?
>tfw op doesn't realize his moms electricity costs are skyrocketing because of his shitcoin mining
Too bad that trying to transfer that out will take a month and cost $10
Electricity included in rent That's not how it works
So whats the go with basic GPU mining?
Does the extra electricity costs outweigh the profits mined?
I haveG4560GTX 1050ti16GB DDR4 ramIs there any way I can mine from home?
Is it worth it?
That was unexpected for me.
I decided to turn off my mining since yesterday because my most recent payout is stuck as an unconfirmed transaction.Thanks for posting this, I will turn my mining back on.
Holy fuck get the fuck off this board and then off yourself you stupid faggot
How many 390s?
No way you just got one.
Thanks.
Is it actually mining BTC blocks now though, as opposed to Equihash / Cryptonight (and converting to BTC)?
Has r9 390 and 980ti
Nicehash automatically switches the algorithm to whatever is most profitable.
Right now, Equihash happens to be that algorithm.
wtf how why whats happening ??
run a big extension cord from your neighbors house lmao
That was short lived, but fun nonetheless.
Above $10 for a high end gpu pr day is just not sustainable.
I'm getting double over here and just got a bump from what I used to get.
once more what happen did the miners stop ??
that was short livedwhat do you mean, is this site no longer working or something
