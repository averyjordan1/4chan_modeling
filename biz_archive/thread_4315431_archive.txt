ALL IN ON LINK BABY FUCK EVERYTHINGREPEAT AFTER MESERGEY WILL LEAD ME TO GLORYOH GLORIOUS SERGEYLIVING IN PEOPLE'S HEADS RENT FREEBASED MONEY BELLYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I'm unironically going all in Link, not because I genuinely believe it will moon soon, but instead because it's somehow more stable than BTC and BCH now.
have you heard of ethereum?legend says it stays or swing around $300sounds stable to me.
also has high liquididty and fast and cheap transactions
i dont think its going to moon soon.
but link is definitely a good long term play
Chainlink sucks
I've bet on 3 coins so far since their conception.
-OMG-BCH/BCC-LINKSo far I'm 2 for 3.
First two have already mooned bigly.
LINK will be a major moon mission by end of 2018.
