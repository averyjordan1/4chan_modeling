Thinking about putting back my unused savings into a MSCI World ETF, but the equity market is so overvalued it's sketchy as fuck.
I have no bonds and the returns are too mediocre to even think about investing in them if you don't have at least 500k to spare.I have 2k in crypto.I also made 2.5k in three days the one and only time I daytraded on the stock market, out of pure luck.
I'm proud of myself.
