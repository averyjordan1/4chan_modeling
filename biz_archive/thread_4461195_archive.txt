>invest in things with good outlooks in the future>bleed like crazy>actual scam ICOs moon to hellI hate this fucking market
I blame the chinks.
I blame the thought process that this is a get rich quick scheme cause people see what BTC did and the alt boom earlier this year so nobody has any patience
That too.
I love seeing pink wojacks over stuff not happening NOWW WAAAAA.
LINK is a perfect example of people wanting to be a 1 hour millionaire.
This board lacks patience and it always leads to wojacking.
imagine if these people though this way when Bitcoin was first startingsure the product was brand new and incredibly easy to get but it would have never became what it is now
All good things come to he who waits.
Let me guess.. HST?Fuck man, I'm down 50% on this shit.
Can't wait for binance to see it gets the market cap it truly deserves.This market is irrational as fuck.
I still feel bad about investing in LBRY credits.
Would have thought it would at least be a stable bet with a functioning platform and clear goal of becoming an alternative video sharing platform but nooooo had to go bleed out.
At least that taught me to use stop losses more often.
Adapt or die faggotTo an extent nothing is really guaranteed to go up exponentially
adapt or dieyeah I really want to partake in the thing that makes crypto look like a gigantic scam and gets in the way of mass adoption
enter volatile market predominantly dictated by speculation >Invest in products with said "good outlooks" but no market traction> fail to realise that "things with good outlooks in the future" is an entirely anecdotal judgement >"Why will no one Hodl :'(">literally wants mass adoption Why don't you invest in stocks you fucking retard.
When the normies come in droves and the market is regulated as fuck it will be crypto will be shit.
Thats not even mentioning the Wall Street kikes manipulating the price.
