>what is printscreen
> it's not a screenshot but a PHOTO of a screen therefore it must be real> because it's absolutely impossible to produce a pajeet-level fake PDF and take a photo of it with your Xiaomi phoneThanks, Karthik, I'll go all in now, thanks for this incredible insider info.
Also kys.
man the dump of POWR will be glorious, all these retards FOMO buying because of these fake newslatters..
EVERYONE GET IN HERE
To be fair to Powr, I don't think there's 10k BTC's in Powr due to pic related faggot.
>making the screenshot as shitty as possible will make it seem more realisticreminds me of those ssb "leaks" on /v/ a few years ago
You poor faggot, you'll never make it!!!
you underestimate the king pajeet.
Yeah but you're overestimating the cesspool known as /biz.
If this entire shitplace dumped powr it would cause approx.
0.57% price drop.
So even if the entire /biz is filled with pajeet shill "Powr is teeka's pick", it's not enough to put fucking 10 thousand bitcoins into it./biz entire net worth is 10 thousand sats.
Grid+thank me later
The fakes aren't just posted here tho, it's all over twitter
Google Transactivegrid and L03 energy and you will see the work these have been doing for the last 2 fucking years!Watch this interview https://youtu.be/aIR8IOpT_fg [Embed] and you will understand why peer to peer energy trading is NOT POSSIBLE with the current infrastructure and why their agent device is actually crucial to it working in the future.
Not to mention that it is more secure than a ledger nano s and will be the first consumer device powered with crypto that the average person can use without needed to know anything about crypto.Not enough?
PL are doing a tiny trial in a suburb of Perth between 4 apartment buildings.. LOL.
Same with their “talks” of projects in India, only for NEW developments.
Basically need to rebuild a city to work with their system.Grid+ is rolling out their first stage to the whole state of Texas!
That’s 28 million people that can use this TODAY without changes to the infrastructure.Not convinced?
How about this MOU with Japan’s biggest energy provider to go ahead once Texas has proven successful?
https://www.coindesk.com/no-nuclear-japans-biggest-utility-turns-blockchain-power-pivot/amp/ Also have Innogy the largest energy provider in Germany ready to go as well.
Co-tri city partnership https://consensys.net/ventures/partnerships/Would you rather go with Joe Lublin (cofounder of Ethereum) and his team of the most experienced Ethereum developers or with Jemma and her subpar team who know they have nothing revolutionary and are just riding the PBC rumours which they probably spread themselves!
Teeka will suggest an absolute shitcoin listed on retardelta to his boomer subscribersAll in, thanks anon.
seems legit
Its not just the /biz shilling.. its being shilled in every single PBC leaks group, telegram, slack etc..Also, there's lots of readers of /biz that never post and have big money.
And of course this is just to start the pump, and the FOMO buyers will cary the rest of the way.
Same as what happened with BCash.
Ok I get that the only thing wrong with Grid is being listed on ED, but in every other way its better than POWR.
Please explain otherwise.
OK baka, I'll play your stupid game.> Teeka makes a "top secret info report" for boomers> Teeka will announce the "secret hidden gem" pick to his audience> they pay 3000 bucks to read this shit> they open their mail> the hidden gem is a fucking 200% green candle billion btc volume top of the exchange coin/biz - as always - good at /bizness.
Smart money resides on /biz.
altcoin markets are crowded, and competition is fierce, this is obvious FUD fake article
I agree, his BCH recommendation up to 1400 was ridiculous.
Poor subs that actually bought at that time, since it was around 1300-1350 when the news hit...
Can one of you crypto experts tell me why GRID is a shitcoin that will have the same fate as Confido?I really dont get this shit!
Why dont good solid projects get the attention they deserve?
welcome to crypto son
>didn't FOMO at +40% because that's dumb, it goes to 80%bleghh I still feel I did the right thing
Ok so should this be the strategy:Only hold Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Buy any rumour you hear and sell before the news hits, regardless of what the news is.Don't research any coins for yourself to find hidden gems, let social media, /biz and reddit and idiots like suppoman on youtube tell you which scam to go all in on next to get 20% plus gains each time?
lol
Never buy a *moon* coin that has already broken 2-digit percent increase
