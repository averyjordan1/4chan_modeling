What, it stayed as a top crypto?Ripple is centralized with more than 80% of the owners being held by the ripple founders.
BCH is at least a decentralized coin with 5 different development teams heavily invested in making this the best coin ever.Plus the only way to get BCH is from BTC holders, and most present BTC maximalists have sold it out of emotion, so now the new BCH holders are a new bunch, buying BCH feels like BTC again but much cheaper
