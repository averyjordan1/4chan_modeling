No you arent you fuckin faggot cuck larper
I am, no larp.BTC mempool is up 8k in the last half hour, a lot of people are yet to dump.
I've only ever made one crypto purchase in my life and it was $10k in BCH 2 days ago.
I got a piece of advice to always do the opposite of what /biz/ says and that just paid off big time.
and every biz thread says buy bch now.
just sayin.
Chinese scam
blow off top... get out.

Oh no.
You fell for it man.
He has a point you know.
It's going down much further.
As much as I like it, and as much as I believe in the flippening, it's not gonna happen today.
>btc and bch are your only optionsohhh you absolute fucking plebs, enjoy your legacy public shitcoins
