Kek gl breaking 10k
I have found 0.65 BTC from 2012 back in the time I was mining and sold it for $5500.LMAO newbie brainlet wants 6k with his 30k.
GTFO to stock market.
I did this back when it dipped to 3500.
Sold enough at 7500 to pay off everything and now have .8btc left.
Basically got it for free so it was worth.
godspeed anon
