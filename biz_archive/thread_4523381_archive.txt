Walton
xrb
Walton and RAiBlocks are OK but if you want a similar coin with a future go with IOTA

already mooned, next will be XRB.
it seems they will be on bittrex in a couple days, easiest 5x of your life
-48% last 30dInb4 no shitcoin as long as you believe in itInb4, no i'm not retarded i just have special needs
IOTA has an AMA on 11/30, getting on bittrex within 2 weeks, bunch of december announcements, just started their foundation, UCL wallet by December.
IOTA will double within a month.
XRB may as well, I'll look into their december.
Damn yeah ark has had a pretty rough week.One of the coins I actually have a lot of faith in however, it'll have its time soon.. doesn't seem like there's any real reason for the dip either maybe its just a late bloomer in this alt season.
IOTA will double.
Maybe.
Double is boring, I'm staying with the 10x missions
ARK recovering from a double bottom, buy now or fuck yourself you poor faggots
> Ark isnt a shitcoin
