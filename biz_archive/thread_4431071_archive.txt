Consider this folks.
Currently we have DASH, RIPPLE, LITECOIN AND BITCOINCASH as competition up until it matches ETH value.
Now also consider this, if the rumours prove true and the Chines govt starts working with NEO and ICO preferentials compare that usefulness to the other coins.
A blockchain tied with a govt.
is way more of value the pretty much all of those coins combined.
Competing against Ethereum's value almost become a reality and not that far sighted.
Something to consider here.
Also consider tons of millionaire/billionaires in China that want to experience the Bitcoin fever like we all have back in the past.
It's all there.
DO YOUR KEGELS.
If the rumors were true we'd already be at $100 from the chink insiders and their families buying before news release.
This -finally anon with brains on /biz!Anons be warned.I don't care bout price, may go 30% more or dump before news, I'm not holding any.BUT I know China.
Worked with China, lived in China.You don't get free ride with chinks, if rumor was true price would go PARABOLIC due insiders trading.Remember insane "bcash" pump few days ago and time frame ?Yup.Gl all.
Thats why you hold, eventually this will happen and you do not want to miss it when its there.I personally accumulate all the time and never sell.
Here's a lil something
