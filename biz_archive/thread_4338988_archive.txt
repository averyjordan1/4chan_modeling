What the fuck are these stupid currencies used for?
When am I ever going to use LINK or ARK or OMG for anything?
Justify this shit please.
you wanna pay for stuff with crypto?
i sell you stuff for crypto!
I've used Bitcoin to pay for cam whores.
Why do we have 1000+ other currencies
Holy fuck none of those other coins you listed are even currencies.
Maybe fucking go to their website and read about them?
You are going to use LINK to pay node operators to translate APIs to blockchain readable content.And if you don't plan on doing that you should sell all your LINK right now.
Theyre all competing to be the next big thing.
Also some specialise in certain things while others like fucking Bean or Milo for example are nothing more than a piece of shit that does nothing new
