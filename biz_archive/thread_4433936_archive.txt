why would any normie use this over Ebay?
it's not solving any pain-points for a customer, and its only going to be 10% cheaper.
The site would have to be just as easy to use as Ebay and we all know that once an ecosystem is established it take huge force to move people away from it: i.e.
much more than 10% cost and some minor privacy gains - buying on Ebay is already private from a normies point of view
Team is actually a lot better than most shitcoins teams
