How the fuck are normies content with working 8 hours a day for FORTY YEARS?
It boggles my mind.
I would literally kill myself if I was forced to work one of those "comfy office jobs" that they drool over for 5 years.
Kids, debts, Jews.
They pretend that they are satisfied with life and worki isn't fun and fulfilling.
However there are rare cases where people actually do work because they love their job, like a lot of artists, musicians, some programmers etc.
they just drink themselves to sleep when they get home lolI wake up comfy, sleep comfy, have comfy dreams
social pressure cucks fall for that,OMG Anon you dont work WHAT YOU try a diffrent path then all other sheep do?YOU MUST BE OUT OF YOUR MIND AND VERY ST00pid
