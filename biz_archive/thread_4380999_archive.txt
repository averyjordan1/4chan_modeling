IF monero can hit $100 then why can't LINK
LINK is a shitcoin with no future.The value of the token aside, ChainLink is a useless product.
The "oracle problem" doesn't even exist.
It's just fancy marketing for an exit scam.
hahaha Link is such a piece of shit.I genuinely feel for you guys
Link is a shitcoin
MAINSTREAMSMART CONTRACTSPic related - smart contracts will be standard procedure in future for derivatives (a market estimated to be worth between $630 trillion and $1.2 quadrillion)
Link is a shitcoin
3 years ago when my grandmother was dying on her death bed she instructed me to buy LINK.
I have invested everything I have into this coin.
I hope my GRAM GRAM didnt die in vein

It absolutely will hit $100.
If BTC can hit $7,000 then LINK can get to $50,000 because there's even more supply of tokens for people to buy and push the price up.More tokens available for purchase = more purchases of tokens = huge price
Nobody wants to buy it look at the charts.
You got swindled
What charts are you looking at?
Everyone wants to buy LINK, there's just not enough of it available for sale.
4381242contd.Obviously we're quite far from the time when smart contracts are industry standard for derivatives and financial shit.
But this is where the market is going: it's more secure and cheaperWhether LINK ends up being the market leader in middleware between external data and smart contracts isn't certain.
But it is currently the most advanced by far - Sergey has been working on this shit before ethereum even existed.
Banks, investment firms, etc.
(like SWIFT) will start by testing out smart contracts in small areas of their business and as trust grows they'll look to implement them in more and more areas due to the security and cost benefits.I thought the crypto bubble had got too hot around summer time but if LINK (or some other middleware) can bridge the gap between the walled garden of smart contracts and real world data then this really is just the beginning
THE CHAINLINK NETWORK HASN'T EVEN LAUNCHED YETLINK IS ON GARBAGE TIER EXCHANGESONCE BOTH OF THOSE FACTS ARE ADDRESSED IT WILL DRAMATICALLY RISE IN PRICETHIS IS MY FIRST AND FINAL WARNING: BUY NOW OR MISS THE FUCKING MOON MISSION
