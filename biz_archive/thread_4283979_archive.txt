Do NOT join the BigPump discord group, the VIP members and the admins are the ones dumping on you, not you on random people.Don't fall for this stupid scam.Admin is literally a pajeet also.
And the mod is always trying to be meta and thinks that he somehow looks better that way.
"Wow guys please don't listen to this FUD on 4chan.
They are just JELLY of our sick gains".
And after his pumps fail miserably and everyone loses money (except for him of course) he'll blame them for not holding.
Pathetic joke.
>join the group>see if what they say they pump is pumping>short it after a while
Exact same thing happens with several other Discord groups, off the top of my head I can name Delta-V and Accelerating Coins as two that are just bullshit
So are there any good pump groups?
Hes right tho
This one https://discord.gg/MmXHNwGOthers are bullshit.
This faggot is giving you the link to Bigpumps, the group that this thread is about.
I guess there is no point in writing this because you probably made this post just so that you could reply to yourself with on a proxy.
"vizard" the admin sounds like the way a pajeet would say wizard
You are muted.
