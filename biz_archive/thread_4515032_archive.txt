Easiest money of your life don't miss out.GET IN WHILE IT'S CHEAP AND BEFORE STAKING STARTS
How does one get internet access without using the infrastructure of the big ISPs?
how many Subs do i need to make it?
i've only got 30k so far
Chainlink
What does the token do ?
Definition of vaporware
Rumor has it you need 100k, but could be a bit less.
Much bigger staking rewards than Ark so worth loading up.Your connection is irrelevant.
The site needs to be hosted on SUB and you can access through any connection.
The ISP can't block the site you're visiting.Not chainlink....
Helps run the platform through staking.
More stakers more bandwidth available
I didn't get to buy enough, please dump
It's happening!!!
