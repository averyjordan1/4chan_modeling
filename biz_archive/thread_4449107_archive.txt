What platform do people use to day trade?
I'm starting to get into it, I did a bit of day trade on gdax a few days ago but it's such a limited platform (not many alt coins), I want to branch out.I looked at Poloniex and it seems nice but they are having issues verifying my identity (shitty photo ID) and it seems it doesn't have many altcoins either.
Also it forces me to trade in either BTC/XXX or USDT/XXX which is a bit shitty, I'd rather trade with fiat if possible.What other options are there?
I don't trust bittrex.
bitfinex
What platform do people use to day trade?Interactive Brokers.
waves platform is good and good for arbitrage.
volume is low, but that means if you master it now and it goes big, dam mane.
