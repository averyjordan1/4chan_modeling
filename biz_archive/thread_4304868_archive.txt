Sup, /biz/.
What case can be made that the BCash rally and the cryptocurrency itself is the product of jew chink shills in a conspiracy?
A lot of the positive outlook can be chalked up to the fact that the network is scaled and useful with low fees.
It's really hard to hold on to legacy when it only has utility as a (((store of value))).
That seems like a house of cards to me, but jokes on me when it's mooning to 12.5K in Q1 2018 amirite?

lol or Poland's
First, don't use the term "Bcash" as that's used pejoratively by core shills so they don't have to say "Bitcoin" when talking about "Bitcoin Cash"Otherwise here's the best evidence.
You have a lot of volume going on in China.
Many Chinese miners support Bitcoin Cash and mine it, and like any cryptominer making their crypto more popular makes their own holdings more valuable.
If you hold it and are prominent in the cryptocommunity you'll say good things about it to make it more popular.Oh and lots of miners weren't on board with Core's Segwit without a 2MB increase.
Core screamed bloody murder after Segwit finally got added until the 2MB hard fork was called off.>That seems like a house of cards to me,Why?
First, don't use the term "Bcash" as that's used pejoratively by core shillsOK, good to know.
"BCH" then.>Why?Because I can't see the utility in something that literally only stores value and has no physical use or utility as a way to transfer value easily.
It's not even like a pretty painting that you can look at and show off to people sometimes.
It's nothing
