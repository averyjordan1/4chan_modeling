Is anyone keeping their coins on native segwit addresses?
Currently only Electrum supports them.
how can i make a segwit adress on electrum ?its currently empty so why not
You need to create a new wallet and use a segwit seed.There's no other wallet that supports them yet, so you can't send directly to a native segwit address from a non-Electrum.
Native addresses start with bc1.
Here I go: moving some coins to a native segwit-address.I'm scared.
so whats the use then if i cant use it to send coins to bittrex n shit
You can send to any address you want, you just have to use Electrum.The only problem is receiving payments to native addresses.>Wallet that isn't Electrum -> native addressdoesn't work.Read > https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/
Ledger hardware wallets support them too.
Bitcoin Core wallet and most that are based on it as well, you just have to set it up manually
I think they only have non-native segwit addresses, those start with a 3.Native ones start with bc1.
