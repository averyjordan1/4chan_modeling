Always take profits.
Never invest on a whim.
Just buy BTC, HODL, and stop being homosexual
your life must be really awesome if you sell it for 2k>lost wallet key to 70ETH
4473901I've lost 2k€ on gambling before.
This just adds to the pain now.
Fuck me.
Why don't I learn?
you're going to KYS over 1600euros?damn what a pussythat's like... a month and a half minimum wage in france?
I think I will just buy the next BTC dip (whenever it comes) and never go into alts again.
It helps that one of my customers pays in BTC.
Maybe if I'll just hodl what he pays me I get some of my money back.
I’ve lost about 50k.I don’t even know what’s normal anymore.I’m still up from my initial investment but yeah it’s brutal.
This current market for alts is fucked
You could have made +108% if you bought Chancoin when you first saw it.
$1 per coin next year!
Where I live that's 3 monthly wages if you have an above average job.
I lose (or gain) that much every 3 minutes.
No big deal.
% in BTC and the rest in trading shitcoins.You'll still get the gains from BTC and don't miss out on the fun of trading.
Prove that it's no big deal by sending me 0.20 BTC.
