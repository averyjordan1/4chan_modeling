Want to take profits on my alts, but I know BTC will dump and alts will rocket again meaning I don't want to sell back into BTC.
What do I do?
every time i make the switch the thing i was just in explodes and the thing i went into crashes.
So after a while i decided i would wait a few months (alts this time), while they slowly fucking bled.
Decided to finaly say fuck it and trade only btc for a while and boom, alts go up again.
WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE WORK AGAINST ME EVERY TIME

BTC doesn't give a fuck about what you want.
It's heading to 8k.
