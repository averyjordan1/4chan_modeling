XLMPOWRCOSS Should I go balls deep anon?
XLM or POWR.
With XLM they gained a huge community with their IBM announcement.
Lots of chatter about pumping to take over XRP's .20 price.
POWR has a smaller community for sure.
But they have a ton of interest from the retail consumer and the financial institutions.
I'd take XLM because the price will probably maintain regardless of a communal movement.
POWR could drop, but it could also go up to $5 if it gets onto more rumored exchanges + major announcements ahead?
COSS will never be this low again
I can only speak for POWR at the moment, but in just over 13 hours is their AMA.
If that doesn't reveal anything price sensitive you might want to sell for the short term, or wait until the next Palm Beach Report who knows.
I know XLM has potential, but most of their milestones should be happening next year iirc.
Sorry 25 hours not 13

oh if you want fud then coss is a scam
Thx biz Derail this thread I’m done with itI’d beat these girls with my nightstick if you know what I mean
You know what anon you’re right it’s definitely a scam.
You should stay far away from it, meanwhile I’ll keep receiving weekly payouts for holding coss tokens.
God yesss free money!Biz won’t go for it

Coss is a very good choice.
Don't be left on the sidelines once their announcements start rolling out soon.
