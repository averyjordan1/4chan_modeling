"Arrives in 8 days"I tried to buy on Coinbase and I get this.
My checking account wasn't charged.
If after 8 days can they cancel my buy?
Anyway to avoid the wait?
I want to be a smol bear now
Anyway to avoid the wait?Yeah by using Coss.io next time
You can use debit for instant payments on coinbase, for a fee, of course.
Accounts get charged 2 days after initiating the buy.
If for whatever reason they can't charge it they'll cancel it before or on the day your coins were supposed to show up.
thanks, guess I'll be on the lookout then.
Stop paying the noob tax.Put USD into your coinbase wallet and then buy from gdax
Shit won't let me sign up.
"We could not confirm this identity based on public records.
Please double check your information or try a different address. "
Coss is a garbage exchange which doesn't accept any fiat you stupid shilling faggot
Are you murican ?
They wouldn't verify my second ID needed for gdax and I'm Canadian.
