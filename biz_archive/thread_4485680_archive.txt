I mean how the fuck is it even back up like nothing happened.
this is ridiculous!
I've not sold yet but I'm going to soon, I've never felt so nervous about bitcoins price movements.This is just stupid at this point, it would be wise to cash out at least some of your holdings right now.. anyone who is full bullish and can defend this chart right now is retarded
Just wait for the normie dip

fuck this manipulated coin.
ThisI'm out at 10K, fuck this shit
Me, taking some time off crypto.
Maybe I'll miss the rally to 10k, but holy fuck, the risk seems extreme right now.
Any negative news from tether/usdt may cause a crash
I’m getting killed, sold bought and resold.
I’m out right now while it is mooning.
I’m staying for this because of the bittrex fud going around, their Reddit is claiming withdraw us stalling out, fud will spread and tank things, pls...
Why would you ever sell outside of having so much money in bitcoin you need to cash some out to retire?
