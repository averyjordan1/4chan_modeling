KMD is gearing up to go haywire.
This is one to get on!
Take profits from your coins that have blown up, because this one hasnt yet and is just about to.You better have a good reason not to be getting in on this shit.
Solid shill op.
I bought a position just before you posted about it.
>wallets are trash>Monaize partnership isnt that great>cringe dev team>little margins for growth in the short termmeh.
Wallet is getting overhaul.
Just like their site.
You may be right on a few points but I have to agree with OP that right now is a solid entry point to see some quick gains with KMD
Once they fix the wallet I may reconsider, it's not like you are going to see this shit spike in 1 day by 50%.
Plans changed, nigga.
The money is going elsewhere.
Lol.
Do tell.Probably some shit coin
walletsThe latest Agama app works flawlessly for me, maybe the trash is you>MonaizeYou are short-sighted if you don’t see the opportunity ahead with this partnership>dev teamCringe because they’re not white, pol?
Because the lead developer jl777 is more or less anonymous?
Do tell >short term growthI know current /biz/ has tunnel vision on P&D shitcoins and a hard-on for Link, but what if I told you there is more to cryptocurrency than gambling short gains?The coin stands out as a privacy-optional Platform/ecosystem.
The developer jl777 has been making ‘atomic swaps’ since 2014 - hell even I have made atomic swaps now.
Yesterday during the stress test, users completed over 3000 atomic swaps.
Look towards the future, anon
This nigger gets it

They were also added recently to Upbit, Binance, and HitBC (soon)>but they have BarterDEX so why go to centralized exchanges?Liquidity
