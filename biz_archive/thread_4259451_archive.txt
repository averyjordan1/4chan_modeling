>be all in on btc>just woke up>all the alts are mooningfuck you segwit
BTC is a gentleman's coin and you will be handsomely rewarded for iron hands.
You'll be Rothschild level if you stop chasing FOMO.
>Sold Nuls at 0.15 BNB yesterday in anticipation of BTC making more ATH's>Wake up
a small handfull of alts up 20% in ten hours ----> mooning.
My God how that standards have fallen.
Bitcoin is dead dude, stop with all the denial.
Alts are the future.
Amen.
If you're not in alts right now, you're wrong.
Alt markets had been taking a dump for months because of the forks and they're about to take off again.
