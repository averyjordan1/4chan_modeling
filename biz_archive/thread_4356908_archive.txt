I have $20k in my life.
Should I put $10k in crypto?If so; what should I choose and why?
Don't bother with $10k.
Put the whole $20k into REQ.> Why?> moon
k in BTC, set and forget for 5years.Keeps it easy + sticks with market leader and the strongest one.
% BTC 30% eth 20% POWR
Get a nuls masternode for less than 9k then spend the rest on mtl.
DYOR
Just buy 700 NEO and generate gashttps://neotogas.com/
This.
I wish I had a spare 20k at the moment.
Though I might be inclined to switch out MTL for SALT.
when the fuck is NEON 0.0.8 coming out?
I want to get to the rest of my RPX without having to run a full fucking node.
