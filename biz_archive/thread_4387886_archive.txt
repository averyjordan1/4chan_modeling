Price predictions EOY?
3k sats
I have 150k of this.I don't see it breaking 8 cents/1.5k sats by the end of the year unless the entire alt market recovers, which I also don't think is going to happen.That said I'm not selling anything under 50 cents which I hope is a reasonable target by the end next year.
Extremely aggressive amounts of USDA single REQ will be able to buy thousands of omisego stickers with skateboards on them.
See attached pic btw.
This thing hasn't seen a real run yet.
I wonder when it'll happen...
Please don't post about this on biz.
You don't want these people holding our coin
This is already probably the second most held altcoin on /biz/ besides Link.
4387971Oh fuggNeed to get rid of my stack
About $0.1
deluded
Honestly, it might moon if they do release their website before EoY.
It'll join the ranks of alts that finally got a fucking product out and people can actually see the use.
I split half my OMG into this to get 109k, just because I can see REQ 5-10xing quicker than OMG will.
OMG will not truly moon until Q2 2018 when staking is active, and then again when Plasma is released.
This is the biggest fucking reason to go into this.
Not only has it not had a run yet because it went unnoticed during the BTC fork shitstorms, but it's a legitimate alt.
Even if you don't believe in the tech or the team, this couldn't be an easier PnD target.
For once in your fucking life guys, buy low and ride it.
not truly moon until Q1 when they release scooter with Nike sticker photo>and then again when the new omg anime series does proper fan service, Q2 2018ftfy
Yeah, I'm pretty much all-in with a huge stack.
I feel pretty comfy.
