Anons.
I didn't listen to you all and lost on BCH.
I made more BCH than I originally had in the swings but ultimately lost money.
I am an idiot.
What coins are we buying /biz/?
ETH,LTC,LSK,MCO,XVG,BTC
BCH.
ARK.
Pressure building right now.
Got out of that days ago and was stupid enough to try again.Any recommendations in particular anon?
USD/ETC looks like it's forming a pennant pattern towards bullish continuation right now.I bought 1000 ETC @ 16.8 just now, expecting a rise in the next 4 hours.
My stop loss is at 16.0.
I love XVG, beauty
Hoky shit moron.
If anything that chart implies there might be an bounce incoming.
