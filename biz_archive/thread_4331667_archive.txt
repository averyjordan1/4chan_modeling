Because a bunch of crooks have fooled some gullible mid-IQ people to support establishing the monopoly of the red chinese NonameCash coin, property of the PRC.
and to hell with the market, the people or the concept.
Billions of profit and total control at all cost.
If the NoNameCash coin wins, I AM OFF THAT SCAM for GOOD.

kek its gonna be fun to see your pink wojaks later this weekyoure probably around 107-113 IQ, you're not as smart as you think, and if you think blockstream bitcoin is anything like the original bitcoin you are either misinformed or literally retarded
Step 1 to identify a corecuck shill:1.
Never refers to Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash.
Uses terms like Bcash or similar which omits the word Bitcoin.
