Newfag here, what the fuck does this mean?
I've never seen the walls look like this
whales keep the price down.
Green is asking price and red is the selling price nigger
I got that much.
Usually both walls have looked pretty similar.So this means a stagnating price or a dip can be expected when you see the walls look like this?
There's ostensibly less demand, and more supply which could mean prices are more likely to fall than rise.However, neither side is obliged to trade at any price so you'll often see walls put up for other reasons than trade.
For instance, a red seller might but up a green wall then suddenly remove it giving a looney-tunes run-off-a-cliff feel to the market where he hopes to buy more at substantially below the current price.Order book walls are ephemeral.
Absolutely don't rely on them to decide to trade or not.
