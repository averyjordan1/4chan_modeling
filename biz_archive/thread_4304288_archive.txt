Thoughts on LINK?
The idea of the crypto itself seems like it could have value.
Seems very likely prices could 4x, 5x, + in the near future.
Should I wait till it goes back to like .16 or get in now?
Projections?
There is a 82.73% probability that you will make a 342.828% ROI if you invest before November 14th.
Any other stupid question?
alltime low is like .15, all time high was like .45.
Its only .18 right now.
Still a lot of room for profit
this.15 will be a strong resistance level.
0.17 might as well be the bottom here.
i dont think linkies will dare test its ICO level.
if you don't mind me asking, what paltform do ou use to trade LINK?
