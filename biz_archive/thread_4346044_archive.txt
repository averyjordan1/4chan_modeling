BUY CALLHey guys just dropping a trading call I found.
Check into Decent.bet on Etherdelta.Supposedly the Japs love it and theyre releasing on a new exchange (some Japanese shit, Bit+ I think) soon.Also releasing casino test soon, and final Q1.I saw a few people posting about this recently, but now is the time to buy.
It's already making a slow bullrun.Any other buys?
Lets talk EtherDelta pre-exchange.
Garbage Etherdelta chart (I dont use ED much until recently, normally Bittrex)
Their Reddit needs more attention.
It's so dead.
I hope they move from Slack soon, it's been full for awhile now.I've been following DBET for awhile.
They're part of the 51% crew on Facebook.
Also it's BitPlus, not the symbol.The main reason it's going up right now is they were at a some Blockchain conference in Japan.
I've been in since ICO.
It was 0.00036 then.
Waiting on this Bitplus then I'm gonna sell 20% of my holdings.
So youre not doing the house pool profit?
Sup Revv
I am, with the 80%Haha I know Revv and I can tell you first hand he doesn't even know what 4chan is.
I met him in Vegas, that's why I know what DBET is.
He doesn't even have a reddit account.
I wish I was Rev, he's insanely rich.
I prefer Jed anway.
Rev seems kinda egotistical.
4347516I just follow him on FB for calls and general trading advice.
He seems pretty chill really.
Looked into this other day.
picked up a decent chunk after seeing videos of them at the conference
I wish I heard of them pre-ICO, but they were so small-time.
I could have doubled my money easily.
