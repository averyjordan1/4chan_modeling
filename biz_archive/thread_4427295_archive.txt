There were folks who sold their sub $10 ethers in 2016 and beginning of 2017.
In hindsight that was an excellent time to accumulate.
As for OMG it has roughly around the same number of coins as ETH (and ETC?, think about that) so at some point soon folks will see it is undervalued and will wish they took advantage of these current sub $10 prices.
I'll buy when it goes under $6.50
yes, under 6$ would be great.
I missed when it plunged down to 5.80$ few weeks ago
Whi is this pumping.
Was going to buy at 100k sat but had phone sex with my gf instead.
MOTHER FUCKER I WAS 3 MINUTES LATE TO SELL AT TOP BECAUSE I WAS TRANSFERING FROM MY LEDGER
