LTC GUARANTEED TO MOON IN NEXT WEEK IT FUCKING ALWAYS DOES WHEN BTC STABILIZES IF IT DOESNT I WILL EAT MY DICK ON NATIONAL TV SCREENCAP THIS
stay poor underage brainlet
$100 USD by Thanksgiving, Korean influx is coming
xmr will moon first, then ltc.
Guyscurrently holding both VTC and LTC.
Was thinking to switch my VTC to LTC but also think VTC will moon soon due to hype for the halvening.Any advice?
Would like to ride both of them to the moon
Buy LTC and XMR.
VTC has no reason to exist when lightning goes live, LTC+BTC pair is much stronger.
Don't think VTC will be big in the future, but I do expect nice gains in the lead up to the halvening (12 december or something)
The fact that /biz/ suddenly started shilling this coin compelled me to sell half my stack
/biz/ was actually right for once
biz also shilled bch for says before the 2400 pump... honestly though ltc has real use, bch is a meme coin.
expect 100 EOY
I did only sell half...I mean I sold half my stack today, hedging against a crash
