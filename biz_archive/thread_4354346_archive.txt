so guys the numbers on the left of this chart.... do they represent the number of a particular coin being sold/bought, or is it the value of the potential sale converted to an amount of BTC?
It's a graphical representation of the order book.Those are orders.They change every second.
They don't mean shit, they're unfilled orders.
the absolute state of /biz...
this wall is at 11,222.
Obv its not real order thats going to be fulfilled, but that literally represents someone trying to buy 11,222 BCC coins for 1 satoshi?
Welcome to the world of Cryptocurrency
not new by any means, i dont use the depth chart ever really.
i recently just started to visualize the weight of the order book.
the numbers on the left confuse the fuck out of me.
why is it a huge spike around ~.1 and that falls back to 1 satoshi.
shouldnt it just be a blip for .1. or literally there are insane orders for every satoshi value under .1
they hooked an AI up to /biz/, reddit, twitter, etc and it measures positive vs negative comments about the coin.
the graph represents the number of comments and the total cumulative shill vs fud.
i hope all of u get cucked by a black man.
cheers all
i just made a buy order for 1 satoshi for like 20,000 bcc wanted.i saw the chart go back to 1 satoshi but the wall was at 900. why does the chart not spike to 20k on the left then?

this is a biz board help each other out idk why everyone is such a dick here
all people using conditional limit to buy less than their set price
