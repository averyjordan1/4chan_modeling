Is this legit or a pump and dump?
doubt its a PnD it only went up 50% after ico, its quiet undervalued.
Think of it as you want i think it has potential
seems pretty legit> already 2x ICO> 2 advisors work at Facebook> unique protocol on top of ETHWith ETH and the EEA becoming a new standard and BTC's bullshit controlling the market, I can see this concept being fully utilized for smart contracts in the future.I think other people see this value too, hence the quick rise.Plus check their website.
They even have docs passing Howey Test AND public github.
It's ready for Bittrex it's just a matter of when.
And you know what will happen then.
its legit tech, it will appreciate in value
The last Quantstamp thread was about the team, I think it might have been right...Looking at the time and the chart.
It's the Chinese and/maybe, the team that's doing the pumping and dumping.
While the rest continue to hodl.They guy said, 'enjoy your "announcement" '.
There was suppose to be an announcement today, but I haven't heard a thing.. Should have been announced an hour ago.I don't know what to think, but hodling definitely isn't the way to go with this.
Legit, don't let FUDDers fool you and DYOR
what's the circulating supply / market cap?
was the announcement the Huobi exchange?
no, bittrex listing
#buytherumor
There are no signs of that
it is pump and dump.
