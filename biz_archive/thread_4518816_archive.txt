I am autistic and fink it crash soon.
What do you cunts think?
No, doesn't feel like it... maybe after new year.
Not just BTC.
Crypto as a whole.
I would say alts are even more vulnerable, because BTC has so much brand recognition in the mainstream, it's pretty much synonymous with crypto to normies.
Thenews keeps shilling btc, which is good because heaps of normies will start seeing red and never return to the cryptolands.
