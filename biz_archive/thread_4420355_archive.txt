Well then you would know LRC is actually part of the upcoming neo news
It's not the same thing at allAnd it is partnered with NEO, and it coincidentally has a major partner releasing news that will pertain to LRC in 3 dayshttps://neonexchange.org/
I hold LRC but still don't see what it was to do with this news.
how is it different
https://neonewstoday.com/development/city-zion-announce-neon-meta-exchange-nex/NEX and LRC have been working closelyLRC would potentially allow NEX to do NEO ecosystem to erc20 exchanges
Also considering what news is going around for NEO, and LRC being a chinese coin and working closely with NEO as a partner, there could be other big news for LRCThey just rebranded their logo, it's only logical that they might have some news as well, especially considering how exchanges relate to the ICO space
