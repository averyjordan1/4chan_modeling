Well I'm fucking giving money away on Bitshares!
How the fuck do I only get 2300 of a coin listed at .02 when I deposited 230 USD?
I sent BTC to the open.BTC wallet and then tried to buy ZEPH at the listed price..what am I missing besides being a low dangling Chad?
Fuck!
I mean openledger.
How do you use this damn piss?
