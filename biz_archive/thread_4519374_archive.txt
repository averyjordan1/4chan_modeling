It already was back at $5, don't tell me you missed the train anon.
developers shot themselves in the foot with their dogshit hyping strategies, irredeemable shitcoin/scamcoin confirmed.
the strategy on saw them grew to 1 billion market cap in 2 months without any product.
When you will know the answer it will be already too late.
The show is starting Nov 30 and continues through December.
Remember it well anon.
The exact same strategy that has damaged their reputation terribly and made a complete meme of them.
insert funny le skateboard meme here
That was never their strategy.
The hype came from the 12 year old bustards who took the sk8board and apple mayday seriously and hyped it up.
It hit $14 with hype alone.
Now imagine with an actual product?
Do you even realize that everything what you are talking about are just biz memes anon?
Skateboard stickers, Apple hype, etc.
It was all constructed in here.
You are basically fuding yourself.
there's like 5 more months to get on the train.
lol
I have over 5000 OMG will I make it
You will know you are wrong soon enough.
4520403They never cleared up the obvious rumours and if anything they hyped it up even more once they were aware of them.
Also implying standing in front of a fucking google office wasn't building up hype...
They behaved like teenagers throughout the entire ordeal, so unprofessional.
They did make Reddit post that said clearly that they weren't partnering with apple.
Omise and Google -did- create a partnership, just not the kind that you wanted.
It was entirely /biz/'s fault that they read in more than what Jun was saying.
But hey, these selfies with 3rd largest bank in the world must mean nothing right?
PLEASE gib proof of SDK release soon
