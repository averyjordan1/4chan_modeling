New DAA fork is a complete successThe hardfork was implemented without any hiccups, but the algorithm will still take time to stabilize the difficulty.Hmm...
I say that the algorithm will still take time, but looking at the block times (https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/cash/#4d), it already seems that on average 10 min blocks are almost reached already.
Maybe he traded at the right times or margin longed.Why the CAPS and the Wojak?
Ok it was more like 3 weeks but w/e I've been buying since the fork so I accumulated most of my BCH at $200 and some at $300-350BCH is not going anywhere but up, I bought another $400 of BCH earlier today because ~$1200 is the new bottom.
