bought at the peak today, fomo got to me and didn't know what else to buy as btc was dropping and missed the alt moons, should i sell now to take small loss or hodl?
short term price predictions?
Back to 300
I think it'll go up
It's gonna rise till EOY.
It and litecoin are safe hedges against Kikekoin the more normies get in to the crypto game.
Haha did the same thing.
I forgot my mantra: never, ever buy ETH again.

They should rename the fucking coin $300, cause that's all it is, EVER.
Just buy REQ with it.
just hold eth for a week itl be at 420 soon then higher, also chekem
