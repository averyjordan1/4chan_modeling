Should I open up my 401k early and put it in some real investments?
I dont have job no mores
yes.
you can turn your 401k into a Roth IRA, tax free.
then you can manage your Roth IRA yourself.
Can you give me a step in the right direction
Put it into Groestlcoin (GRS) before their rebranding in a month or two.
It'll go from 0,50$ to 10$ after that.
20* gainz.
your broker that manages your 401k can help you with this.
also my apologies, you cant go to a roth ira, but you can go to a traditional ira tax free.
google "401k to ira rollover"
All in LINK no stopsjk but seriously, eth my dudeeasy 40% gains in a few years

MAGA awoos dumb as usual
