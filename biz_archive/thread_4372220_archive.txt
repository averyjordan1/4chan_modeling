Any of you guys verified with your crypto accounts?
Or is it better to stay anonPlease help a dum dum
For reference i want to get all my coins out of bittrex and for a unverified account its 0.025 btc worth a day.
Its shit
I have exactly one account, it is verified on Coinbase with all my info.
There are definitely no other accounts.
I don't use Monero at all.
yeah i gave bittrex all my info but i no longer use themi only use binance now because at least the chinks wont come looking for taxes from me
