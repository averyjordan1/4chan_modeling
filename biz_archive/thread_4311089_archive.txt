i was trying to buy a bitcoin via coinbase, but it said 10 days to process payment and deposit the coin.
i dont want to wait that long, can i close my account and have the transaction cancel?pic unrelated
no
Does it look like we are coinbase support?
Frig off.

Odds are the transaction will never complete anyway.
The last few people mining bcoin will jump ship in a few days
