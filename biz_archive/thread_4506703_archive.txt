Get ready fuckers
ZCoin is better
Fuck does this mean for the technically illiterate
priced in
accumulate 42 ZEN for 1 node
This is freaking huge.
That 3.5% ROI
Per year or per month?
Where are the figures?
http://zen.lebre.net
not 3.5% roi.All the secure nodes split 3.5% of the blocks mined.
So if there are 10 000 nodes (which is very possible, probably upwards 12k after a few weeks), then you get 0,00035% of each block reward...
So with current block reward at 11 ZEN you could earn ~0.02 ZEN per day by running a node, assuming 10,000 nodes.
Given Zen will be $100+ soon.. awesome.
Zencash...
So comfy and tranquil
How much does it cost to run a masternode on DASH and what do you make?
cost is $293,000
you make 80K+ a year
Fuck yeah.How much is everyone holding?
ZCoin's nodes have much better returns.
The founders took a huge paycut to make the ZCoin ZNodes juicy as fucking fuck
Enough for 24 nodes
I have 7 ZEN.
Should I set up a node?
you need 42 zen for a node
soon at ATH
Well this is also $1000 vs $12000 (if you bought in when you were supposed to with zcoin).
how does one set up a node?
Thats gay why do only big baggers get nodes?
