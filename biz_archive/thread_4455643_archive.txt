why can you not withdraw with less than 0.1 BTC?
Hmmmm, let's see how hard you're larping1Mwo4z3LwjzxewD3pHvNaVCtnraKVupDTe

Use ethereumIts cheaper anyway
That's really small though, you're telling me you can't withdraw ~$300 worth of btc?
Which is like 0.045 or something.
Is that message only for bitcoin or I can withdraw in other coins with cheaper shit?I only have 20 bucks and I'm trying to learn this shit.I only have 20 bucks, I'm just testing the system.300 is one month and half of my income.

just buy ETH and withdraw, should have enough for fees
Are the withdraw fees diferent for every coin?
Czech em
yea they are a percentage.
For example in Kraken BTC withdraw costs near 6 dollars and ETH about 60 cents depending on the current value of said coins... also I advise you to buy some cheap coin with low capital, not LTC or dash.
go all in in something like POWR and learn the fundamentals of the company and technical analysis
I just bought some dash, hope to sell them in one week.thanks, I wasn't expecting to make much with 30 UDS of litecoins.I bought litecoins because that's the cheapest coin I can exchange with cash on efecty.
I kinda disagree with the other poster.
I've made a lot of money just buying and holding the most normie coins.
You can get lucky with the other ones, but it's more of a chain letter game than technical analysis.
