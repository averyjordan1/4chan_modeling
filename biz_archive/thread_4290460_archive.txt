what is this skateboard meme
well, we found photos of jun with skateboard.
jun's skateboard has an apple sticker.
jun has an apple watch.
jun likes apple products in general.then someone started memeing that omise has a partnership with apple, because of jun's apple fanboyism.
and lots of people took the memes seriously because this board is full of pajeets and underage south americans.
?Are u this retarded u omisecuck?They kept feeding the meme and raising speculation with shitty stickers and tweeting pics of them in front of logos of companies with no affiliation to them.
