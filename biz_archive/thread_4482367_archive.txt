Will we see an alt boom like the one this year in 2018?What do you think biz?
only boom we'll see is BTC growing even more cause normies don't know what an alt coin even is
unlikely
No a period of bear market till 2019.
Tether crisis incoming, pull out and go fiat.
Buy back in when cheap.
my normie m8 knows about eth and ltc, and my normie (well, reddit) coworkers know about some altcoins
Chainlink = Ripple 2.0Iota = DGB 2.0
knows about the Coinbase coinsyeah real 'alt' there
