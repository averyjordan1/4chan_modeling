feeling comfy
have you talked to that canadian dude thats holding like 70 million of these bad boys?
Nah, lucky guy...If he didn't buy the peak
You were supposed to sell in June
hes been holding forever (maybe since 2015?
), you'll come across him at some point if you're a regular here, although he hasnt posted in a while now
I bought 75% of it this month.
I'm expecting it to peak again around June.
Hah, poor guy.
I bought three million when it was at 30 satoshis and sold close to the ATH this summer, bought back a million a couple of months ago.
