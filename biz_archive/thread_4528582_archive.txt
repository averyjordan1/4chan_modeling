What happened?
The dragon is about to get slayed
It's pretty crazy how Bitcoin isn't dropping.
big if true
im asking it myself since yesterday"how?"
People are in BTC for the fork snapshotof the next hardfork Bitcoin Diamond (BTCD)
Is this fucking true?
My guess is that swing trades of btc pairs are keeping it alive
bitcoin diamondare you actually serious right now?
this isn't fucking pokemon, what the shit people...
cant wait for the jan hardfork 3 bctd for every 1btc.
Let's say it's true.And after that?
what do you think about bitcoin*insertgenericnamehere*?
BTC goes down.Hella bearish right now.Alts may rise?
Or will BCH topple?
I also think a pump in BTG is very possible.
But we will never know exactly how things will unravel.I am just /comfy/ holding ETH and some BCH for the gains.
