>sold at $8kHow fucked am I?
I put a buy order somewhere close enough that I'll break even after the fees but will it drop down there?
It's a coin flip anon, probably in favor of pumping to 10k, but in the end we're still due for a huge correction (the BCH fiasco doesn't count)
I hope so.
There may be another BCH attack coming, so it can still fall below 8k as early as this weekend.
Shameless bump, I've sold half my portfolio
I did the same OP you are not alone I smell it in the air its coming the dippis maximus is upon us
You should buy at 8k actually, because it was a clear breakout.
Bitcoin tends to range upwards, and there's no reason why it would stop now.
Think like a trader, buy breakouts, any other way you'll be buying high and selling low.
Breakouts are the only safe entry points with promise of rise in value.
Any other entry is a late entryThat being said, were still waiting for a real consolidation.
Hey friend, I guess I bought your Bitcoins :D
I sold today after it went down from $8300, not once it went past 8k.Hope you have weak hands anon
Yeah but I fear by the time the correction happens "the dip" will be higher than 8k.
There was a dump not 24 hours ago that sent it back to 7800.
Something like that would do it.
