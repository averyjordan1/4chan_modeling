What do you think my fellow autists
both

mah niggaIOTA, ftw

I'm not saying that it's a superior philosophy but NO2X announcement = was a pretty strong indicator that people are still excited about holding Alts.
If anything just being in BTC is a bit like just betting on Black or Red on Roulette.
The high risk / high reward of alts is too tempting.
Well... atleast BTC is down a bit to buy.
I expect the alt's to level out within a few days.
Don't buy any alts though and get stuck in the FOMO.
