BTC pump imminent.
BCH about to die.
Nah
if you're not a shill, why did you make a thread?
Take note.
You only see btc shiills here because they are either paid/terrified.
I'm holding bch and I'm terrified
BCH is dead already.
total shitcoin
BTC won't break all time high again until Q3 of 2018 screen cap and thank me later
You're actually retarded
Everytime someone asks for a screencap the most retarded shillshit follows
Shill Rule 1
Blind optimism is bad for your health.
I'm holding both and feeling fine~
Just yesterday, every other post was a variation of "Bcrash is a shitcoin" and "Roger = literally Hitler".Nice to see anons siding with BCH for a change.

BTC will drop to 5500 - 5000 usd this week before mooning to 10k+
I donâ€™t know man, I expected the dips in the last few days to be a lot deeper as well.

I fucking hope so, I've been waiting for a big dip to buy and I missed the last -5500 one

Their reputation is already garbage but they don't want to keep adding new scandals to their rap sheet.
Just buy some LTC/VTC if you want to guarantee profits desu
