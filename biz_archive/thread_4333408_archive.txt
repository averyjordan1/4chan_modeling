'official' support.
read their tweets and see where they are leaning
lol.
Does Pepe Trump even know what Bitcoin cash is?
Congratulating them on success is not necessarily support of the coin over BTC (or the other way around).
You read into money skelly way too much
nobody said anything about BTC except for you
I'm all in.

Yep this is the last chance for BCash; the final pump.After the fork and change to the difficulty tmr, miners will switch to BCash once again and have majority hashing power.
This will be combined with a major pump from Roger, Jihan, China/Korea to make BCash explode.
Good luck anons, make sure to get out with your profits this time.If this fails then I'm out and back to fiat for the time being.
I switched my whole portfolio to BCash at around 0.19 yesterday, so I'm still sitting mostly even so far.
