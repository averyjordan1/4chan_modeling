wtf!
i came in into biz/ on the august rush only holding something like 0.05, and get used to trade and browse the board at the same time.
now im not even at the 0.01 (only few loses, cashed out and fell for the muh cloud mining meme) which means im not trading atm because of my low btc amount, but im still here on biz/ spending the same ammount of time, i didnt expected this board to be so addictive, im feeling like pic related.
btw im not complaining but amazed about how much this board has dragged me.
did this happen to you guys?
I went up.
But then I don't fall for every PnD/meme/scam on here like most people.
tfw when portfolio has tripled since coming to /biz/
LOL?
Why didn't you just hold bitcoin you loser
because i needed the pain of losing almost all for learning the valuable lesson of hodling if you are not sure of what are you doing trading.
I didn't need to lose any money to figure that out on day one haha.
Holding BTC and ETH for 1 week and already up 40%

4436113yeah, there are some good people here amongst the bad eggs, such is life.lol, good luck to you, as well, anon
Biz is good at picking good projects but they're also good at convincing you its your last chance and you have to buy immediately, just make a note of which coins get hyped and buy them when they dip which they almost always do
sage advice.
just buy LINK and SUB and SLR and SNGLS and NEO and wait 2 years.. bury the fucking wallet move to nicaragua whatever it takes man
