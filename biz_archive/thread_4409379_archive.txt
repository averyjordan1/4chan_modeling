>bch total supply: 16,806,125 >btc total supply: 16,684,362,763 more than btcHow were they able to mine it so fast?
You know already but I'm gonna spell it for the dumb fucks who can't understand:DIFFICULTY MANIPULATIONThere.
Bch was never meant to take over btc, its just another shitcoin.
i dont actually know, so thanks for pointing it out.
It's because of the EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment).
Blocks were getting mined at a much faster rate than 1 per 10 minutes.
It took them a few months to sort it out.
It is fixed now and guarantees 1 block per 10 minutes.
Why does this tell you bch is a scam?
i think hes trying to point out that it favors only miners and not traders because of this, in a way it fucks with traders while miners benefit.
Alts have been banned from exchanges for things like this.
Yes the bch EDA can be manipulated easily whereas btc 2 week difficulty adjustment not so much.
Seriously just read around and look at videos to judge by yourself which is the best coin, every opinion is based somehow.
