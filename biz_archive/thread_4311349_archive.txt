THIS IS NOT A DRILLBCH just passed ETH in market cap
ALL HAIL OUR NEW CHINKY OVERLORDS
even BCH and ETH combined Market Cap wouldn't topple the kingDisappointing, tbqh.
I hope when BCH takes over, ETH will get its share back from the bloated corpse of BTC.
I never thought I would say this but crypto is starting to disgust me, I thought it could create a truly decentralised economy but now I realize it's nothing more than a game big miners play, shame on them.
This is the future that PoW fanboys have always wanted.
Ironic, isn't it?
Mark Karpeles literally gets a golden parachute after fucking everybody on Mt.
Gox.
Sound familiar?
Big banks and other irresponsible companies getting bailed out?
Now a cabal of rich miners conspire to kill bitcoin while having control of BCH, and switching the whole market over to them.
Nothing about this appears decentralized, it is always big players getting their way.
