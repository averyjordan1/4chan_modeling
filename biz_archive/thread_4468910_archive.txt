Hi all.
Investing by top Market Cap guy here.
I recently cleaned out a friend of mine's old paper wallet and I can't be bothered to deal with the Bitcoin Cash / Bitcoin Plus from this legacy wallet (It's only $33.00 anyway).
So, I'm posting the private key here and it's up for grabs (probably only a few bucks worth).
First come, first serve.
Lots of love /biz/ Public Key1HHwvJNBDnZpPu2QbSt6PuWGGQuk8yCjR3Private Key5JS1D5uPjzq74APzcuvBEjh3ZDSbmtLEEQx9znRRsxp5DiNPGoW
QQ HOW DID IT TAKE 40 MIN FOR SOMEONE TO FIND THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Did someone get it yet?
I don't have access to both block explorers.
it seems like its been cleaned out already
It took 10 minutes for someone to claim it.Didn't expect /biz/ to be that slow.Didn't expect a real free $4.70 either, but I guess that accounts for the first unexpected.https://blockchain.info/address/1HHwvJNBDnZpPu2QbSt6PuWGGQuk8yCjR3https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/1HHwvJNBDnZpPu2QbSt6PuWGGQuk8yCjR3
