Has anyone checked out XMY Myriad on bittrex?
Volume has gone up a bunch and the development team has stated that they are working on a segwit soft fork.
The coin is pretty interesting, It has 5 algos that take turns mining blocks, 1 block per minute.
I have seen they are already hyping it up on discords
The market cap is super low, if they are hyping it on discords could this be whales accumulating for a push?
It's cheap, if segwit in december it could take off.
Yup, very promising coin.
I love the fact that anybody can mine effectively with their hardware.
Volume has been going up a lot.
Lets hope for the best :)
This thread seems like a discord group shilling.
What's with that huge peak in august?
Lets just pump this shit
I've bought some of this too.
Multi pow looks like the future
Cool !
this looks promising, going to invest some
I think someone typoed.
dyor this is undervalued compared to some other coins
This has been one of my better finds in the past couple of weeks.
I love the fact that literally anyone with a device can use it and 5 algos make it much safer than their competitors.
Seems like more people are starting to find out about this coin.
Volume has been increasing for.the past few days i dont think it will stay at this price for long.
Makes sense I guess
This appears to be a bull wedge here.
I think it's only a matter of time before this coin gets noticed and bought up!
Multi-algo is the future.
Bought 250k
DGB also milti-algo, both are interesting concepts
Has this coin even mooned yet?
Recently bought into it.
Looks very promising!
