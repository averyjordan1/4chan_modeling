Sup biz, are we currently living in the best era known to man?
We have high speed internet accessible almost anywhere.
A world of information available at our fingertips.
Best economy in decades.
The rise of cryptocurrency.
It seems like this is the best time to be alive.
Agree?
>born too late to explore the earth>born too early to explore the universe>born just in time to see linkies get btfo
Best parts of the world being overrun by low-IQ barbarians>set for economic collapse the likes of which has never been seen before>Scumbag baby boomers doing their best to destroy what little is left of what they inherited so Gen-X/Millenials/Gen-Z get fucking nothing>proliferation of nuclear weapons to badshit crazy regimes >imminent rise of biological/genetic weaponsYeah we're truly blessed.
No because the Jews own everything
Internet is the best fucking invention ever.>can communicate with more people than I'll ever need>no dangers if you're not retarded>learn anything you want, all the popular books are available>crypto to make gains>cheap access>no censorship>get to know cool places and able to get there with crypto gains + online bookings>lots of years of art and video games readily availableYet, the world hasn't collapsed somehow.
It's truly the perfect time to live
