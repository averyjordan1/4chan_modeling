Wont happen overnight, but you will 50x your money in 2018
RCN has huge potential but I think realistically x10 by next year.
It can grow but not x50 imo
what % of ur portfolio are you guys putting into this?
considering going balls deep and long
RCNI agree with you if we think in current total value im crypto next year total marketcap of all crypto will be 1 trillion
%.
Pulling out after x10
I got 20% in it, always 50% in BTC and 30% NEO atm
Also the fact bitrex has it since almost day 1 is very good sign
if XRP can go up 4000% this could easily do 20x next year because RCN's token actually has adoption and utilityXRP has adoption potential but let's face it, banks need to buy it first `
