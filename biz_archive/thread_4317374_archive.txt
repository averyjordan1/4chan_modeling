BCH is over.. You can tell by the atmosphere on /biz/ alone that it's over.
The Koreans pumped it and NA jumped onboard.
Sorry to anyone who got owned in the process.
Bitcoins going to shoot back up now, alts will bleed more, and everything is back to usual.
i expect a dead cat bounce
yes sir very good sir
you just didn't buy enough
youre a fucking dumbass.
its not "over"BCH will continue to rise like BTC did until they meet each other at 4k
it already happened, the cat started dropping at .31 again, i almost sold there to minimize my losses but nooope i thought it was gonna keep going up
random anon>market maker
BCH is just a pump by asians trying to make money, they love to gamble.
this is not a flippening, just a fat pump and dump.
Sorry for your loss
Literally ALL transactions are selling right now.
Just because some people are hodling on exchanges and deluding themselves won't change much.
It's all going back to BTC, it was a price manipulation for whales to create artificial BTC dip disguised as "correction".
Thats how I felt when I bought BTC at 6,000 2 days ago.
It'll be ok.
HODL THEY SAYDON'T FOMO THEY SAYDON'T PANIC SELL THEY SAYfuck that, i'm allmost up 50% in BTC
THANK YOU THANK YOUWithout you, it wouldn't have came down to sub 5780, when i sold like a retard two weeks ago.I even made 3% more BTC in the process ( 3% in 13 days, what a performance KEK ).Thank you.
I was never so sad than when missing the pump to 7500, and never so scared to never have it go down to my entry point again.THANK YOU KOREANS, THANK YOU ANYONE THAT HAVE FALLEN FOR IT
