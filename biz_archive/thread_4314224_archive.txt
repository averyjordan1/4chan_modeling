Good luck with that pattern.
The pattern will hold true even if Bitcoin goes down to like $800 or something.
Fuck your pattern.
BITTREX CRASHED AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Donâ€™t you see the pattern in the chinks shilling for bcc?
This is a coordinated attack.

>muh technical analysisFuck off boomer
the peak and dump at the end is much tighter then the previous two, but I noticed this also
Delete this, I'm still accumulating.
Those of us who know know and are there's a method to everything we post here.
Did you include the flippening and the fact BTC cant recover from this hit into your TA?
Okay?
Just buy back in at $5000 then.
I don't see why people try and hold allegiances to these shitty ass coins, if the chart shows that a massive buyback is imminent and someone like you can plainly see that's evident, then it's obvious that others see it too.
No need to bring it up.
nice meme lines
damn youre right.

This is literally the response every time the pattern is posted right before it nearly doubles.
Not for newfags like me who literally have no education in stocks and didn't even know what leverage meant till literally yesterday.
I take shit with a grain of salt around here though, i'm not stupid, but /biz/ is usually correct unless theres obvious kikes shilling for some shitcoin to P&D.
thinks the last few months of something that's 10 years old is all that mattersLOL NEWFAGS
