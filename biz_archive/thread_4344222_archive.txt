Upfiring (UFR) is an incentivized p2p filesharing network that uses tokens purchased by leeches to pay seeders.
The whitepaper is great and I suggest you read it.
What's really amazing is how badly the devs fucked up the marketing of the ICO.
With no marketing manager on board at that time, pretty much no-one heard about it.
Only 4% of the tokens were sold, with just 400 investors getting in.
The devs showed themselves to have the interests of investors at heart when they announced they would be burning not just the 96% of unpurchased tokens but also 96% of their own, to make sure their personal stake did not exceed the 19% laid out in the whitepaper.https://www.reddit.com/r/Upfiring/comments/7ck86w/ufr_token_burn_event_on_november_19th_updated/This gives the coin an initial market cap of just $250,000!
This is the easiest 20x you will ever see.
Currently buy orders are at 2.5x ICO and are nudging towards 5x but this will explode when it hits a proper exchange due to the massively constricted supply.If you want to get in, go to EtherDelta and select 'other' from the coin list, then enter the following info:contract address: 0xEA097A2b1dB00627B2Fa17460Ad260c016016977name: UFRdecimals: 18Enjoy /biz/!

Quite low power level.
I'm not familiar with feenix but the distinctive feature of Upfiring is the coins are used as incentives to pay seeders.
already 6x ico price this is going to dump
It is not.
This is just a cash grab.
