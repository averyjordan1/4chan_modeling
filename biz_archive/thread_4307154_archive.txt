OneCoinI just found about this coin actually.
Looks like that's where all the Ahmeds are.
I've been wondering why we rarely see Mohammed & Co in crypto.
Turns out they're all busy with this ponzi.

Most altcoins and ICOs, not even joking.

Credence coin is an up and coming one
electroneum, huge ico of 40million dollars for coins that they didn't release to the public while people are mining it already.
The code of the coin is just a fork of monero and the project itself is just an phone app that 'simulates' mining by giving you airdrops while you play it.Once the ico buyers get their coins its gonna dump so hard.
The app isn't even finished and the devs have all the coins but the ones mined
You forgot to mention that they kept getting hacked and had to have their ico participants reset their passwords and 2fa.
