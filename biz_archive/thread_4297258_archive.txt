Just look at the volume and you will get your answer.
It was an easy flip and that's that.
The fact it launched at 4x ICO was nonsense, and anyone that bought at 20k sats will be waiting a while to get in the green, but it still seems like a pretty decent project.They just need to follow the designs of that sexy af fanmade style and they'll be fine.

Your scepticism is the only reason this coin is still this undervalued.
Remember the quote 'buy when people are scared, sell when people aren't'?
There's literally no reason not to buy other than another potential dip in price.
People are scared for no reason.
