What do you think about this ascending triangle?
I think it lacks incoming red candles synergistic with bitcoin red candles
>Eth/Usd
seems like a good time to sell
That you drew a really bad one.
it made a new high so go ahead and load up some shorts, sell when it tests the recent low.
buy in if it breaks and sell when it tests the recent high.
it's literally that easy.
GTFO right now imo
