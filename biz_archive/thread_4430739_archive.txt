am apparently stupid.... how do i move ico tokens from mew to ed?!?!
PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ME
That...is a very difficult undertaking.
You need highly skilled training to understand even the basics.
you add the wallet to etherdelta, have to put in your public and private key
DON'T DO THAT YOU'LL LOSE ALL YOUR LINKS
ok. i saw that part, but will that pull my ETH that is sitting on MEW in to ED too?
I just wanted to put the ICO tokens in ED
you deposit into the smart contract from ED after connecting the wallet to it.
Use the reddit guide its literally step by step you fucking brainlet.>Send ether to ehterdelta MEW>on the deposit tab put how much ether you want to deposit into the smart contract>Leave enough ether in your MEW to cover transaction fees (like .005 ether or so) so if you have 1 ether you want to use, deposit .995 ether into the ED smart contract and keep the other .005 to cover the transaction fee.
if you don't, you'll be fucked and have to buy more ether and transfer it to MEW to cover the fee.
