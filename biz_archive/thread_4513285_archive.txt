Market cap: $10milCirculating Supply less than 4milBTFD or miss out.
The dopamine from POWR and QSP is wearing off.
Smart money knows where to place their chips.
Where do I buy this?
It's on binance.Both POWR and QSP are also on Binance, and have hit a relative growth ceiling in regards to their market cap.As I said.
The dopamine is going to wear off.
The money is going to move to the next "moon mission" which will unironically be this token.The room on this particular token for growth is unreal for anyone that gets in at this level.
Right.
That makes sense.
I'm literally taking my powr profit and looking for something to put it in.GVT, huh.Chart looks good.
GVT and HST are the two I've got my hopes in.
Solid projects
HST yes.
GVT no.
stay way unless you have a fettish for getting dumped by pajeets
The number on exchanges is thinning rapidly.
Most people are going to hold this.
That's actually huge... Holy shit.
Are we gonna moon hard?
looks legit.
a platform to combined stocks and crypto.
great for normies
Look at order depth, buy orders are like 10 times larger on binance.Will definitely moon very soon (especially if bittrex happens)
Absolutely.
The rocket is fueled up.I see the market cap reaching 80 mil easily.
This is so sick.
Already up, and the order book is fucking thin.
Dont forget Charlie Shrem is advising
lol at you buying now and now getting advantage of bots in few days/weeks.
I'm close to buy until I click on the "Team"It's just another slav scam coin
