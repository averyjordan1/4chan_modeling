I haven't seen this thread in weeks, wanted to know if anyone else here is running a shopify store, side-business, or something else that they'd be willing to share or help me/another anon out with
OP Here, here's what I do on the side:>wordpress websites for local businesses: bought three good themes at $60 each, host a website for $11 a month, sell sites for $500-$750>social media management: operate under the same brand as above, requires zero overhead>iOS app: currently in the works, but it will aggregate the top news articles of the day and summarize them into a few short sentences>Subscription-based site: two currently being made; one is basic windows tutorials for old people and the other is a tai lopez-esque site aimed specifically at young entrepreneurs with very little money to start out
