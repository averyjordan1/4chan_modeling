Newfag here, been reading about Chainlink.
Will it really go to 100$ by mid 2018?
I need this more than anything.
Been a NEET for 6 months now.
My parents don't hate me but I can tell they're disappointed that I'm not really doing much with my life.
Yes
$100 no fucking way maybe $1
Fuck no anon, maybe $1, im praying for maybe $2.
Wont make me rich but will turn my few hundreds into a few thousands, which is some nice savings for a fag wagecuck
no, but maybe by mid 2019

It is deemed a failure and Sergey eats himself to death.
If what you say is true.
Good chance it could be $1-$3 in Q2 of next year.
Pretty fucking good.
Need to get myself some more link i think.
Was so worried about buying this coin.
I don't know shit about crypto to be honest, just know their is money to be made.
I take alot of my advice from here but you know can you really trust 4chan, i have been around 4chan for awhile and that was the first thing i learnt, be careful and not to trust any faggot on here kek
5% $60Swift and major financial institutions and a slew of businesses announce they are using the Chainlink network% $20Swift doesn't use Link but a slew of businesses announce they are using the Chainlink networkIf this happens alot of /biz/ are going to be fucking outta here in new lambos, as a wagefag ill even be a very happy boy i think.
Wont be rich but will feel good.
Fuck makes me wanna take out everything i have in neo ( only a few hundred dollars, mad as fuck i didnt buy like 13 of them when they were $28, and put it in link) but im hoping neo hits $100 and ill make a few hundred and will be happy with that and I know link hitting $20- $60 mid next year is only a dream.
