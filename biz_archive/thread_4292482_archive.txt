Some people paids $1+ yikes
Is there news coming soon on this piece of shit or should I just sell
Don't sell, keep buying more it'll eventually have to go up.
Just HODL.
Kek i cut losses this was a scam coin on its way to 0
I sold all mine at $1 at 240% profit when people kept saying to hold and it'll go $5 ahahahaha
>falling for the chikcoin memeSomeone made x10 profit because you fell for it.
Sure you did
I'm holding just in case the Chink rumors are true.
Got in at 30 cents, so I'm fine, plus I have been daytrading my stack up
got in at the same time as you but sold at $1.
Feels good man
Looks like that was the right call.
I shouldn't have been this greedy.
What rumors?
cuck ahahahaha
me buying it at 27-29 cents
Nice work chink hope the gains were worth it because your credibility is now 0 i only lost 2 hundo after a couple swing trades
nice, without your loss the price wouldn't have gone up like it did, I thank you a lot, I need people like you to keep doing this so I can keep making money!
Could be worse i could be asian
