No just the usual script.>>BTC is overbought so naturally correction happens.
>>"Bitcoin is dead" fud spread all over social media.
People who bought the top start to panic.
Selling accelerates.
>>Now the price is low enough that traders start accumulating.
Price bounces back up a bit.>>Now comes the "China bans bitcoin" fud.
Price goes even lower.
>>When the price is low enough institutional buyers come in and push the price up restoring the morale.
>>New ATH.Rinse and repeat.
Above 6k+ is still way too high.It should have dropped to low 4k.
It can still happen.
It went up too much too fast.
Ideally it should have corrected from 6k but the greed for free HF coins was too much.
