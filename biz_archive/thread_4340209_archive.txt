So there will be a hard fork to BCH in a few hours.
Will this really make the BCH price pump?
Also why does Bittrex list Bitcoin Cash as BCC and not BCH?
bch is crashing wtffffffffffffffffff
Will this really make the BCH price pump?No, the current price pump is to make the fork have a more profitable entry point.
Probably will pump more as we get closer to the fork.
Already recovering.
Bitcoin Cash wanted to be listed as BCC on all exchanges.
But BCC is taken by Bitconnect.
Bittrex probably doesnÂ´t take Bitconnect serious so they never changed it to BCH
