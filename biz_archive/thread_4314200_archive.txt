Coinbase promised to release Bitcoin Cash to us back in August.
It's now worth more than Bitcoin was at the time of the fork and I was using my Bitcoin on Coinbase at that time to short ETH and long BTC.
I then sold my BTC a few days ago and waited for my BCH, so now that Coinbase has held my BCH for me, where the fuck is it?I want my fucking money.
they said January
Oh alright then.
I'll wait.
BCH will be worth far less by then but I can't help it I guess.
