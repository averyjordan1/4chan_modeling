will it burst?
Will BCH fail?
Yes, it will.It's basically BTC, except it's 100x more centralized, is headed by a convicted criminal and doesn't have the brand name.666 has spoken.
The PnD is over.
no it will change to bch and prolong the bubble
muh centralizedlol, its the same fucking miners on BCH and BTC, it is no more centralized than bitcoin mining already isit is literally bitcoin with 1 variable changed, before they added the security-destroying banker malware called segwit
Any miners who abandon BTC for BCH will abandon BCH for something else.
Welcome to square one.Again, look at the graph and enjoy your criminal-run PnD shitcoin.
You have no devs, you have no code, you have nothing.
stop scamming dude, it's over.
the gooks and CIAfags lost.
BTC devs are creating new branches of cryptography and soon we will have scalable CT+coinjoin and all shitcoins are going bye-bye
