Miners are starting to jump back on the BTC bandwagon to reap the huge transaction fees.It's ogre for BCH.
Even now with giant tx fees on BTC, it's still better to mine BCH by a factor of 1.4.https://fork.lol/
Isn't that because everyone else is jumping ship, so whoever didn't jump is now the biggest.
On paper.
The problem is, there's not much to mine.
Some miners are still hoping that BCH will gain momentum, but if not, we're having the same situation as the last time, everyone is going to switch back.
Last time they waited for only one day.
Make your guess for how long will it last this time.
Yeah slush didn't allow their members to switch.
They missed out on a lot of mining profit today.Probably b/c slush owner is holding a lot of BTC and wants to keep BTC on life support.
Very lame of him to exploit his miners like that though...
Funny watching only 8kb of their big blocks actually being used on transactions.Literally no one uses this shitcoin lmao
No exploitation going on here, they can move to other pools if they want.
He's a brainlet if he isn't accumulating BCH lowkey now while raking in BTC from transaction fees and pretending to support BTC but putting all his gains immediately on exchanges to buy BCH.
And BTC is only used for buying Alts and everybody hates that already.
Whole crypto is a joke
i think the concept of money is a joke.
