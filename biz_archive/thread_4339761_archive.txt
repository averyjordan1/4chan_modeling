Greetings Fellow /biz/ brothers.I am planning to do a Christmas Project, where i send packages with meme stuff (Wojak Creame, Meme Candy, LINK Toiletstone, ...) to you as a christmas present.I need some help though,1.
Before i start to do the math on how much everything will cost, How do i decide who gets a package?2.
Feel free to suggest some ideas3.
If you want to contribute, contact me here:bizmas.elf@gmail.comEverything should be finished until the end of the Month in order for the packages to arrive in time.This is my Tripcode from now on, anything else is scam.
