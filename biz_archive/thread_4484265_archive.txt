You got a useless degree.
Best you can do is get a technician job in a lab, doing mundane tasks.
You'll be making $30,000, but you didn't need to go into debt in order to wageslave $30k/year.
Your life is over.
life is over>can get a job to support himself and has a skill that can make him money without being employed
 he thinks he can work at Amazon with a biology degree and no work experience> he thinks he's smart enough to make money> larping for attention on an anime imageboard> life is indeed over
There's more to life than getting cucked by Amazon.
