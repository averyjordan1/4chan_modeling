I am new to crypto and am trying to figure out when to buy BTC.
I have been watching it over the last couple of days going from 6k to now 7.8k and everyday I'm thinking its going to correct soon so I don't buy.
But FOMO is really getting to me now so how do you know when to buy?
Shilling and trolling aside, would it be good to buy now or is it going to correct soon again?
yea buy high and sell low like a real businessman
never trade based on emotion man, FOMO is a strong feeling
So how do you avoid trading based on emotion?
So BTC just hit ATH and bounced a little.
Logic says the bounce back is when I should buy in
No buy sub 6,500.I you want to buy something now buy ETH.
The second coin on coinbase.If you want to buy a third go with XMR.that's my picks.BTC - Shit tech, brand name, Jews will prop upETH - Big Corporate PlatformXMR - The true BTC successor.
It will not go back down to $6,500.
Buy now.
It is only going up from here
