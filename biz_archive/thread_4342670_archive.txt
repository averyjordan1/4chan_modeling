I can't tell whos more deluded the Coiners who think BTC will be 100,000+ a coin in 3 years or the Cashers who think BCH will be $5,000+ in a year.ETH is the only way to go, and once it breaks 1,000 best be holding some ETC as that will climb to 300+

You seemed reasonable until you mentioned ETH
I can't tell whos more deluded the Coiners who think BTC will be 100,000+ a coin in 3 years or the Cashers who think BCH will be $5,000+ in a year.but anon, bch will be 5000+ in a day
ETH seems like a safe bet to 3x over 2 years - it's a good place to store money and ETC mooned to 24+ this weekend, it's at the perfect price for buying now, it'll be up to 50+ by this time next year, and 300+ in 2/3 years.
The ETH Devs, everything about it screams this is the coin of the future.
