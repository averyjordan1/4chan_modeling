>a year and a half laterMy investment strategy is paying off handsomely.
Stop daytrading and start investing in potential.
You WILL get rekt eventually.
I don't stress and I haven't ever sold at less than 5x.
Way in the green on all my holds.
What are you holds?
ETH, RNC
Humble brag threadIf you're going to start a brag thread at least describe your strategy/coins in more details
BTC, ETH, XRP, NEO, IOTA, EOS.
x on all but NEO because late.
Biggest earners ETH and IOTA.Currently watching:LINK[a computation coin, not golem possibly iexec]
So your genius strategy was to get in early .Well done .
Ask yourself why I got in early and have no losses.
Stop chasing shitcoin pumps, buy coins with an USP instead of shit like DGB or VTC.
What do you think about REQ for a potential 5x mission somewhere next year?
REQ will either x10+ or x0.
Nothing in between.
Too 'general' for me.
YC backing is interesting but I'd look at REQ as investing into a company more than a crypto.
I haven't read much about it.
I try to invest at the bottom of the tech stack, so not really my area.
Can't say if it's a good or bad idea, sorry.
yup.
and people like us get in early because people like YOU are too busy chasing shit coin pumps.
well that gives me confidence.I mean it wont be a quick flip but investing into a company sounds good.
You're a knob...
I'm saying you have to evaluate it in terms of market share and competition from 'normal' companies.
REQ is at the top of the stack.
It is vulnerable to competition.
If you invest in eth, it's pretty independent of USD.
If you invest in REQ, you're betting on it replacing paypal et al.
Might be a good choice though, as I said I haven't even read the whitepaper.
Can I get your opinion on ChainTrade?
It's not on exchanges yet but I think it could be the biggest HODL since ETH... give it a quick look?
Once had 50k Golem.
Their autistic as fuck update videos pissed me off so I sold.
Not sure on sonm and iexec...
