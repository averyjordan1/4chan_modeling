What will life in the US be like long term?
I think very bad.
I'm just think about the future of the country around my retirement time.
To live a comfy retirement in my city I will need about 2 million dollars.
I'm saving a lot but still not on track yet.I can't imagine any of my normie friends are saving for retirement at anywhere near this pace.
Social security will dry up by the time I'm ready to retire, they will have no social security and no retirement savings.
Almost all millenialls will work until they die.
This means they won't vacate their jobs so the newer generation won't be able to find work, which there will already be much less of because of AI.On top of that, with the ever increasing education requirements just to get a full time position not in a trade, pretty soon the minimum requirements will be a Bachelor's degree.
Maybe even PhD.
That means you will have people nearing 30 years old who have never worked and are in tons of student loan debt.The only way people will be able to survive is if the government induces universal basic income.
We're headed for basically Communism.
My father left Communist Poland in the early 80s and he said it's getting worse here than it was there.Can we discuss the possibilities please because I'm pretty scared for my future.
Might move back to Poland actually.
Don't worry.
Nuclear war and 3 billion people dead will reset everything.
Meant to write Masters degree will become the standard.
Bachelor's already is, and in my career of civil engineering where the vast majority of people only hold Bachelor's (71%), In school they were pushing us engineers to go to grad school...God i hate the government with their mismanagement of money
Well, that's a relief.
You should be a motivational speaker.
Bump
We are in an education bubble right now.
There's gonna be a drop in higher education rates in the next couple decades.
