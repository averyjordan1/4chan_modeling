Run...runaway MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA let me see those pink wojacks MUAHAHAHAHA

That's why you always hold your Bitcoins, no matter if Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash.
Those still holding their free BCH (after the split), are very comfy rn.
I just bought high...Getting ready to sell low
BTC holders confirmed soyboy marxist faggots
If BTC and BCH actually flip I'm going to unironically kill myself
thank you for your sacrifice not everyone can be a winner in trading
Suck a big black cock like the cuck you are
All hail our new overlord Jihan.

Once the difficult rises they will dump this shit for BTC and it will drop to 10 usd.

If there's one thing you should know about crypto, it's that no one knows what the fuck they're talking about.This won't happen, just like Segwit2x was cancelled and Bitcoin Gold was a flop.
% of the advice given here is utter crap... with the combination of shilling and fudding and pajeetery itâ€™s a wonder anyone here is making gains
It's a P&D, our whale group teamed with a couple massive groups in Korea.
We are dumping BTC into BCH, when BCH hits $1700 and BTC is crashed we're dumping back into cheap BTC.
just went all inlooking for an easy 2x
 then 2000 then 3000 then 4000 then 7000
the article is fucking real.
jesus christ this shit is really happening.
approaching 2x gains on my investments now since a few days ago.
I started crypto this week, got in BTC it rose, then went to NULS it went way up, then moved those profits to BCH and its skyrocketing.
Why didnt I get into crypto long ago
Any profit is good
lol would you look at this noob /biz/ I think its time to sell it all
of course they wont flip you turdfriendly reminder that in 5 yearsBTC = GoldBCH = Trading pair and payment option
If u could all pls dump bch right now and pump shitcoins that would be great thenks
This^They will reach parity, and rise together.
