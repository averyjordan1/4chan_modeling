Tired of gambling on shitcoins?
Want to get in on the derivatives action before those CME plebs?
Ask me anything you'd like to know about BitMEX, the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange.
Up to 100x leverage is offered although you should stay far away from it unless you are completely certain about the momentum and have enough collateral to avoid liquidation.
Most people suggest about 10x maximum for a newcomer.
There are stop hunters and liquidation hunters who push the prices around a bit to catch overleveraged people, but if you are competent at risk management, you should be fine, or at least learn a lot :^)BitMEX is NOT a cryptocurrency exchange - as in, you cannot buy litecoin or ether here - which is the misconception many newmexers have upon joining.
It is a derivatives exchange that trades in futures and swap contracts.
The primary purpose is for cryptocurrency holders to hedge their risk against downturn, although it can obviously also be used to magnify gains through accurate speculation.
You can also find a role here arbitraging between futures and spot prices.
(see: cash-and-carry arbitrage)The perpetual inverse swap contract is a $1 contract bought with BTC where you have more bitcoin (dollar-wise) to gain from taking a short position in a downturn than you have to gain by taking a long position in a bull market.
Another fascinating thing about taking a short position on XBTUSD swaps is that it effectively can create synthetic USD without ever having to go through USD.
All this from the power of derivatives!
