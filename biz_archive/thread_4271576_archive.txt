EDO has just begun its take off right now.Huge buy volume and walls are coming in.Don't miss it biz on Bitfinex.
Small cap with working product you can download from the appstore.
legit undervalued product, does everything OMG will do including an ICO engine, one has a 700mil MC the other is just 25mil (and selling under ICO which was 3 dollars).On bitfinex, they have a column in forbes, a new exchange being released next month, 120k downloads on the app store, seriously the list goes on and on...
the buys are almost double the sells on finex...yeah could moon, will see
looks good, already got the appbut I can't seem to find anything on the token's use?
TFW cucked because in U.S.
Circulating Supply: 10,708,403 EDOTotal Supply: 90,708,326 EDOThis Coin has basically already a Marketcap of 250 Million and early VC Investors dumped all their Coins.
Plus the whole Team are italians, lol.I rather buy TokenCard a undervalued coin at 30 Million Marketcap and Product launch in Q4 2017.
Im sorry for you EDO Bagholders.
Nice shill breh, you must be american, jealous you cant buy?
went all in on this.
The next NULS dont @ me just screenshot
I was about to go balls deep but then>the whole Team are italians
Arent some of the smartest people in history Italian?
no
This coin has a bigger launch in Q4 than Tokenchit lol and a way smaller market cap.Whatever though enjoy your shit coin i will enjoy my 200% gains in a few hours.
Smart italians all leave italy it's full of annoying retards with strong feelings and poor sensibilities.
The app is very normie friendly, when they release the in app hybrid exchange next month it's going to be big.
Also I just noticed a huge 90k buy order on Finex, wtffff
the normie friendliness is what makes this app amazing, i think the crypto world hates that normies will enter with apps like this
this is a good one.
50k in the bag
