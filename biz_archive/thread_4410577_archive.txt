What new product?
Their app is already out.
Also evidence for exchanges?
Their web platform, arbitrage bot and ICO rating something something that's supposed to release this month.
Obviously they are more concentrated on products now (adds actual value to the token)Not fucking exchanges (adds pajeets and 15 yo morons to your community when you have no product)
Been in since ICO braugh.
New exchanges would be most welcome
