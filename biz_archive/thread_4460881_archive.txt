Does this have a bottom
I've lost a lot of my smallish investment into this, but the dividends could be nice, and it might take off in anticipation of the dividends next month.
Their portfolio is mostly ETH which is due to take off soon I think.
They also just posted a financial report I'll see if I can link it.

Overpriced.
I saw people paying one eth for 100 of these tokens.What was the ico price again?
Does this have a bottomNo it's ass is just as flat as yours.
Yes.
80% of ICO price.
Once it hits that I'll think about buying.
Still way overpriced right now.
