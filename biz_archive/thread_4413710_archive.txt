I'm about to go all in on BCH with x3 leverage
I wouldn't recommend, we're still bearish / no trend.
Unless you were planning on getting in an out within 2 minutes or something.

Don’t use leverage unless you know what you are doing.
If you mess up with leverage you won’t even become a bag holder.
wtf is leverage
When you essentially bend over for an exchange for them to go in dry.
