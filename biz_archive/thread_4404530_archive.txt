I am deeply concerned about our fellow /biz members that for some reason invested heavily in LINK.
As we all know, LINK is now in the final phases of total collapse and heading down to its true mcap value of 2-3cents.
I know we talk a lot of shit here, but many are losing everything and are on the ledge.
Try to have some compassion during this time.
Thank you.
