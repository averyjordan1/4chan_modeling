needs more 'bit' or 'coin' in its name

This is actually more important than people realise.
With a name as fucking awful as Groestlcoin what kind of normie who doesn't understand the relevance of the technology behind it is going to buy it?
Even further down the line, what kind of society would exchange value using something called a Groestlcoin.Bitcoin sounds fantastic.Bitcash sounds okay.Bitcore still sounds alright.Groestlcoin?
Enjoy your fuckin bags buddy.In 2 weeks another coin with the exact same technical specifications and a less shit name will come out and it will be all over 4 u.
I agree the name is complete shit.
They are doing a rebrand in 2018
Accumulating more and more.Thanks Fag

If your brand sounds shitty it doesnt matter how good your products are.
