I feel like everybody knows about Bitcoin now.
What does this mean for crypto?
Normies are cool.
All that money will eventually dump into alts.
we arr the errly adupterrrs
sooner normies see how retarded the fees and send times are the better for all alts
rocket to the moon
AND WE ARE NOT FUCKING SELLING
Hmm, I wonder what more people using something means for that thing?
Stop being a fucking gatekeeping faggot and rejoice that you'll be making money because you bought before the normies did
let those normies buy bitcoin, it will just make CHAINLINK moon faster
Big bang theory, 20 days, bitcoin episode.
Sell
I'm just curious what this will do to the crypto landscape.
I feel like it'll make it even more fucking unpredictable than it already is.
I have a hard time making money when theres bull runs and crashes.
I like when BTC its nice and steady and i can make money off altsi wasnt done accumulating.
I hope so.
Put a bunch of money into a shitcoin and tell all of them to put all their money in it, thereby inflating the price.
Then dump on them and take alll their money and act like you don't know what happened lol
