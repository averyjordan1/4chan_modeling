Bitcoins surge to 8k yesterday revealed to the world the stuttering Chinks that run this scam.
Price has already tanked 65%.
Once it breaks through the $800 resistance the panic will begin and small holders and speculators will begin to offload, with the whales already long gone.
Once it shoots through the $500 mark, unabated FEAR will ripe through all Cashies.
With all those who dumped their current accounts into this scam twitching at their arsehole continuously while refreshing bitfinex.
The $250 mark will be met, the largest panic in history will ensue.
The final deluded Miners will begin to go offline, and wagecuckers with their engineering salaries loaded up in Bitcoin Cash will be left with it stuck in their wallet, unable to move it to exchanges to salvage some self respect.
The price WILL tank at this point to sub $100, and most probably sub pre-pump levels.
From that day forward the deluded Cashie wagecucking engineering nerds who bought this coin thinking it had fundamentals will go back to their jobs, with no money in their current accounts, to be made redundant by the next wave of pajeets arriving to undercut their wages.
Deluded Cashies will hold bags FOREVER, with no job, no money, and no crypto.
I warned you Cashies.
There's still time to get out.
Sell NOW.
Don't be deluded, don't be an Cashie.
