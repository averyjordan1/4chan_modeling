How do you plebs, not living in a major city, deal with rent prices being pretty unaffordable in comparison to local wages?
I currently live on the east coast, work in tech and make $150k a year.
My rent is $1800/month.
I'm amazed upon doing basic research that rent prices in smaller cities across the US go for $1300 on up, but the salaries are around $65k/year or less.How do you people live on such disparity?
I make $130k in the bay area but my rents $500 a month.
How?
Shitty 2 bedroom with like 4 other roommates.
Tryna save money here
lot of people just not paying rent.
get 4-5 months free rent in the time it takes to evict them, rinse repeat.
yeah I know a few people in a similar situation.
You're smart to do what you're doing while it's tenable.
Do as much as you can to save % of your income while you can.
