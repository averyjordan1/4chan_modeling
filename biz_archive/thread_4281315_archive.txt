You mean to tell me you can't afford one Link?
I'm also a nocoiner but planning to buy coin.
Where do I start?
Which exchanges to choose, which wallet to use, alts to invest, fund distribution and buy/sale strategy for retard, can you give me some advices?
stop shilling LINK, dead coin you bought at ATH
classic /biz/ solution: get a job or suck dicks
Buy ETH on Kraken, coinbase, or something like that but only buy what you are willing to lose.Research coins/tokens you are interested in and then see what exchanges they are on.
Or use something like changelly if you can't be arsed with exchanges and don't mind paying a bit extra.Hold your well researched wise choices.Don't install blockfolio or look at the progress of your choices for a year.
Why buy ETH and not BTC?
Faster and cheaper transactions, also if you buy ETH tokens you can have them in your ETH wallet.I also feel that ETH's development will see more short and long term gains, especially now with BTC's fork fiasco.
Someone once gave me some Bitbean.
After that I haven't been able to sleep properly.
Refreshing bittrex and all that.
So if you want to start yours, ask someone bitbeans .
Beaners are kind people
Please give me some bitbeans?
came here to say this.
