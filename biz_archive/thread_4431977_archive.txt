So who thinks Astro will finally rise once bitcoin starts correcting and money flows into alts?Also its been steady at .004-.005
Has been listed for literally a day>Still trading for x ICO price even after significant retracement from initial surge>"Finally rise"ASTRO is going to the moon as a function of its performance, dividends, etc.
Will absolutely see a big run up in December.
Buy now at these prices and just fucking hold -- you'll win big.

Don't normally believe in any of the shit you fucks peddle, but this one is actually a winner.
Modest prediction, 3x-5x in December.
