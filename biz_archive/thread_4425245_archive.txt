neo... breaking $40 soon
SHABOOEY IS MY BLESSING FOR NEO
when is 50$
$100 by December guys!
(Only because BTC pumped in value)
NEO going past $100 tomorrow.
Broke $40 earlier and will do it tonight.
>sold at 36$
Why?
The news isn’t until Monday and it’s only going to gain traction all weekend.
ARK has a mobile wallet hitting in two weeks.
Worth throwing your gains into if you want Some other gains.
Also POWR has been climbing with their Australia contract.
SSHHH DONT RUIN IM WATCHING CAREFULLY AAAAAAHHHH

>NEO going past $100 tomorrow.

One of their Boardmembers released a statement.
A lot of miners are talking about NEO being the listed as the only crypto China is allowed to trade.
whales wont let it drop below .49 lets wake up to green dildos boys
Got Coinbase on the 1st of november>Bought 1 ETH at $297>Just got Binance and bought 5 NEOWhen does my Lambo get here from China?
lol dumb move bro.
honestly i'd just buy it back though.
you will still profit
 NEO if it hits max predictions will be worth $1500 but more realistically $500 I’m in the same boat I moved 70% if my portfolio into it at 30 and have 35 coins.
Trying to build up to 5 figures in 2 months.

A lot of miners are talking about NEO being the listed as the only crypto China is allowed to trade.Nevermind.... Neo will be another pump and dump.Good luck holding your $40 bags.And by the way Neo uses PoS, dividends are paid in gas.You can already trade Neo on OKex - HuobiPro pegged to Fiat Yuan.
No need to be so salty.
It’s not a Pump and Dump because it’s been pumped and has been there all night long.
You must be new?
How many Link do you have in your portfolio 90%, 100%?

4425560Senpai,Just started and am clueless, have about $150 in ETH on a Coinbase Account, 5 NEO on Binance and have $700 usd to spend, whats the fastest way to turn my fiat into NEO?
What is this competition they talk about on Twitter?
You can't even figure out how to properly reply to people and we're supposed to take you seriously?
>No need to be so salty.

How many Link do you have in your portfolio 90%, 100%?Simple question.Provide a rational reason why I should buy $40 ATH....You bought news.
I bought the rumour thats why you are holding $40 bags.Neo has been stagnant for weeks now, floating between $25-30.
HOLY SHITSOMEONE BUYING 22000 NEOS ON BITTREX
These faggots ''overbought'' Neo at $40.
Now they are left holding $40 bags.
$40 is not ATH m8, NEO was almost $50 in August m8
Send your eth to Binance and buy neo there.
oh
It's gonna happen isn't it
See you at 100 faggot
I just did, but whats the best way to turn USD into NEO ASAP?
NEO just break 40 $looks very bullish, next leg upwards looking imminent
send your USD to me and ill send you some neos pajeet
lets do this
NEO just break 40 $haha he doesn't know difference between breaking resistance and touching it
ITS CRASHING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
friendship ended
the whale clubs are full of retards..."...mine Neo"
remember that its saturday morning in europe, many investor just heard the good news, and buy NEO, and USA is still very early morningwhen europe and US investors see good news they buy more NEO, price increasingweekend is just early phase
strap in boys we in the 40's.
Is the success of ethereum inversely related to the success of NEO?
i think wee see epic ride to upwards by this weekendwho knows, maybe NEO breaking new ATH this weekend
someone is dump multiple 265 neo amounts into it.get in before its too late i guess?
You mean like BCC and BTC?
you type funny
>tfw 10 gas to claim every day
tfw only 170 NEOBut on the bright side I only hade 90 NEO when it was on 50$, so Im getting there.
tfw 9 NEO is your entire stack
Won’t be able to get any more neo for another 12 hours or so, still gonna be worth adding more or will the ride already be over?
The ride never ends buddy
Never chase a pump
Dude... my is 8
The news is supposed to be monday so my expectations are that the ride will continue for the weekend.
yeah but this is a multistage bump until the bubble bursts monday when the news underwhelms
What does this even say??
See

That 113 btc wall just got obliterated.
It's fucking on boysss
Was it a real wall or did it get pulled?
I looked away for 5 minutes and it's gone
Is the success of ali baba inversely related to amazon?
Real wall.
Got taken down bit by bit
got legit fucked in 30-40 seconds.
>mfw on mondayNEO is going to ATH.
called it

closing in on 0.006 boys
>tfw didn't increase my stack at 400kGetting JUSTed so many times has made me a fucking pussy
SAME.
EXACT SAME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh
You gotta keep dying until you win anon.
NEO ath is 0.0119 BTC, so we are just a half way to ATH, so plenty of room to NEO going up
4427015I would be banging 10000$ / hour hookers in my Hong Kong villa with sea view instead of posting on biz if i wasn't a pussy.I am not even joking ( about the part being filthy rich if i didn't pussy my way into crypto early 2016)all in ETHall in DGBall in ANTDone.Instead it was a half ass ride.But i am sticking with NEO this time to 1000$Not doing the same mistake again.
Neo is literally going to be the Ethereum of China.
Let that sinks in, folks.
Im going to let it sink in until sunday night
i dont see why NEO isnt going to be bigger than Ethereum, that looks almoust inevitable factcrytos are here to stay, and China is world superpower and want to be number one
what are you going to buy?
I need a quick bail plan
How long does it takes for neo deposit to arrive on Hitbtc?Been waiting for an hour already
idk.. started yesterday.
Probably going to watch btc and see if there comes a dip.
I fucked up on the dip 9 hours ago at 7500
2 Ethereum $31,820,720,961 $332.16 $546,525,000 95,800,242 ETH 7 NEO $2,849,197,000 $43.83 $399,200,000 65,000,000 NEO *NEO will go x20 without a sweat.
Just give it some time.
If money skeleton could launch 1000 shitICOs and pump this ETH to 30B MC then what do you think NEO with the Chinese empire behind it can do?
x20 within a year?
dollar value ath is 57, easy to break
Probably spring 2018 when the next big crypto growth will occur.
That took too fucking long to turn around.
Got so greedy buying the 500 stack but it'll all pay off Monday.
How did you feel when it went down to 13$ ?
I held bitch.
Iron hands.
he obviously did, but that wasn't the question

Absolutely god damn terrible.I made so many errors on that trade it hurts to think about.
I started telling my friend where I've been making some money, got him on it.
Then he sends me invites to NEO groups and such.
He opened the gates to this whole noob community and I somehow got sucked in.
Filled me with false dreams of a rise to $100.Never again joining a Facebook group for crypto.
It just made every scroll on Facebook impactful of my opinion on neo.
same for me...but I knew it will come back...like it always does...and look where are we now!
Huge news coming out just now https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/7drcp6/live_tweet_coverage_of_the_next_generation/Neo will pump even harder now
Yeah HODL is legit.
But I'm still mad because I couldn't drop that 25k on top of my BTC dip buy.
I shouldn't complain, I guess I didn't lose anything.

If there was anytime to take the money and run with NEO it was when it was over 60, the potential for extreme profits now outwieghs anything short run
