grabbed a stack of ETC anyway when it was cheap at 10$ (normally is around 15$) and now it is mooning to nearly 20$ compared to people mostly going in on bch around 525$ or holding btc and taking a huge risk.there is still money to be made if you just use your head and dont fall into the hype thinking its the end of everything, crypto changes every two fucking seconds so if you cant handle that then fuck off
pumped up already

ETC summit starts in two days, it has been rising the past two weeks and i anticipate it rising through the summit
Ah yes thanks to whoever posted this yesterdayWent all in before going to sleep and earned +0.03 btc when I woke up :).
Not bad!
all in.03 BTC gain:^)
Luckily I bought 810 ETC a few days ago because I didn't like anything else on Kraken.
This shit is literally mitigating any of my losses I make with my other shit coins, especially with my dying LINK.
Makes holding much comfier.
Not owning ETC before the summit is like turning down free money.
anticipate it rising through the summitlike it ever works
It's a pump and dump of a shitcoin.
Ethereum that never has plans to actually scale transactions to where it becomes useful, lmao.Monopoly money pump and dump.
