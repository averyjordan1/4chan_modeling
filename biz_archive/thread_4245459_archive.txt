Wagecucks, this one's for you.
I only have 75k.
Is that going to be enough?
I was actually happy with this going lower and giving us a chance to accumulate more.
Shame I bought my first 25k at around $0.028 But I can easily see this being a $0.25-0.50 coin one day.
And not too far away either.
Please don't let it moon before I get my 100k.
k fag here, were gonna make it
