what time we need to get down, to avoid bag holding ?QSP -- 4k sat easy crossing?BCH -- 1500$
IF you think BCH is stopping at $1500, you're out of your mind.
The amount of money miners are putting on the line right now to mine BTC at a loss compared to BCH so they can raise the difficulty is ridiculous.
When the difficulty adjustment happens and they jump ships...it isn't another play rehearsal.
This shit's the real deal.
Flipping will happen, or at the very least come VERY close to parity with BTC.
Get on or get left behind.
so when would we know btc difficulty levels?any charts ?

BCH is going to $50kBCH will never be a bag.
In fact if it drops below $1300 I would not have any problem buying a ton
Where are people getting this info?
i'd like to see you buy a "ton" in about 2 hours and post the proof here faggotno cashcuck deserves to lose that much money without me witnessing it and laughing my ass of
Thatâ€™s not true right now btc is more profitable
by the time BCH is 50k BTC will be well over 100k
its happening again dudes
You'll be wishing you were bag holding BCH soon
I'm holding QSP until at least February.
Backed by YC and actually has a real, unique use case out there unlike 95% of the market.ETH is also obviously the future beyond belief, so it will be needed in the coming years for real businesses.
this guy knows how to meme line.
I will see you on the moon
Are you guys honestly just cool with BCH and their unethical leadership winning?
Not meming, how can you get behind that though?
How can you expect BTC holders to get behind that?
Because you'll have to, if you flippen.
holifuck, bch moon started
