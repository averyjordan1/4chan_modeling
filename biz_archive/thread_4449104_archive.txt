What resources can I use (besides browsing /biz/ and sorting through hearsay) to better understand cryptocurrency and crypto investing?
I'm willing to take as much time as I need to learn so I have decent understanding of how things actually work and effect each other.
I own some bitcoin and have seen some profit, but if you asked me why I wouldn't be able to explain myself (that is to I couldn't justify buying it, and I can't explain why it's going up in value).
I'd like to grow my understanding so that i could explore other coins and make rational decisions.
