Usually the test of an ICO scam is if you can't mine it, you shouldn't buy it.I was looking into Steemit as a way to make money for blogging and investing, but on further research it doesn't seem possible to mine Steemit tokens anymore.Anyone know if you can use hardware to mine their tokens at all?
Do they even use a javascript miner?If the answer to these questions are both no, then Steemit is a house of cards.
Shit.
