my funds is stuck on ED because I dont have enough to pay gas to transfer or buy, how can I solve this problem?
by sending yourself some eth to pay the gas fee fucking frog poster.
Nigga its only 30 cents

Use a 0.11Gwei gas price.
You can adjust your gas price in the settings.
But then your TX will take forever.
Or buy $2 on coinbase and send it to your ED.
