Who else panic bought / sold?Was all in on Bitcoin.
Yesterday I was a retard and bought 0.5 BTC worth of BCH.Sold it in panic at 0.46 BTC after Segwit2X cancellation and bought whatever alts I could grab.I had like 1.34 BTC about 24 hours ago so I'm not doing too bad considering.https://www.cryptocompare.com/portfolio-public/?id=128960Well done if you had money in proper alts before this nonsense went down.
Sadly I didn't.I hope I'm gonna make it...
