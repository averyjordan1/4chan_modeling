IT BEGINS
what is beginning here OP, did I get memed again?
LRC is working closely with NEO, Bittrex listing is soon.
There's been very pretty accumulation patterns for the last couple days as whales buy in.
I'm hoping for $1 at least.
yeah i've seen these rumors, i'm just finding it hard to get excited about the project itself and to be honest relying on muh bittrex is making me feel uncomfortable around porcelain.
i bought for the announcement knowing it would likely result in a bit of a loss, thinking of taking the chance to get out while still ahead
I don't care much for the bittrex listing myself, but this coin definitely has a future and isn't anywhere near its ceiling.
where would you put the ceiling?
Don't take my word for it, but probably around $250mil cap around $1-1.50
Very solid estimate, I'll agree with this.
mm yeah maybe, I'm thinking more like 150 in the kyber / binance kind of territory
if this coin turns me into a loopie marine I'm gonna neck myself
If those buy orders are real then this is about to pop
they are not real

please tell me we'll break 3000 again soon
the more I watch this coin, the more it looks like nothing is going to happen
that is too much0x is 100m kyber is 150mit will certainly hit 100m and perhaps even 150m in the coming week but not 250m250m later on when it starts being utilized by NEO and such but this is a sure double flip for any anons looking for a moon mission out therevolume has been SURGING already doubled in the past 24hrs
I don't believe you anymore.
I've been watching this coin for 5 days and nothong.
Y'all said it would moon when nex whitepapers realeased
Very solid estimate, I'll agree with this.guise, guise, it's the Chinese Ethereum, trust me.I am skeptical of $1.50, I'm holding 500 but I'm not buying yet because I'm a terrible fiat holding wagecuck waiting on my coinbase ETH to clear
