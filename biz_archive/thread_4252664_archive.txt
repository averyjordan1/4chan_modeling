Is anyone else's Blockfolio acting like shit right now?
Mine is being slow as fuck and not showing the current prices correctly.
Yea.
It's a real buzkill not being able to see my money increase by thousands
Gettin overloaded with everyone refreshing.
Yes
they shut it down so you would find the news late
Yeah.
Takes forever to see alerts, price alerts aren't triggering.
Exit scam
It's showing all green, not the /biz way
On a positive note I just found .01 BTG that I hadn't entered into Blockfolio so there's another $18 in gains I've made today.
I've made so much money buying BTG when it was literally $90 on Bleutrade.
Never told /biz/ about it though.
Okay guys, we need to learn to take turns refreshing.
I'll refresh in exactly one minute, no one else refresh pls.
Guys it's getting worse not better pls stop using Blockfolio
I like freedom
