Don't log in for a year.
Delete Blockfolio.
Next year you will be extremely grateful.
I know.
I’ve got most of my stack in my nano s so I can’t touch it for this very reason.
I’m trying to build up my ETH stack and plan on leaving crypto for 6 months after January with my stacks hoping to come back to see OMG blown up at least.
I know XMR is solid.
Every time BCH/CC moons this shit happens.
Jihan is ruining this market with his bull shit.
BCH did me in the butt again
For the first time in 3 months it's not me.
Glad I dumped all my shit for eth before the pump
This bitcoin pump absolutely JUSTed me right up the anus senpai.
same just now
How is anyone losing money?
We're finally on an ALT bull run
dont you stop loss at all bru?
Pumps can follow bigger declines, and if you didn't timed it right it can hurt - bad.
I agree it is better to choose assets that ,right, climb slower but steady
