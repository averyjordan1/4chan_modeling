4282074which exchange should i get on to get into alts?
currently on localbitcoin.
I want to buy ATH, so this is my entry.
% of the volume comes from Bithumb>not a pump and dump
screened, alsobch has at 70% of his volume coming from Korean exchange, China don't give a shit about this shitcoin.core cucks are buying the dip while you're shilling another shitcoin that'll go to 0 next year
I recommend Bittrex.
One of the biggest and safest
Not too late.
It will flippen.
You can get it on Bittrex.
Coinbase coins go into circulation on Jan 1Jihan is pumping before the dump and you're all going to shit blood.
go all USD for few days instead, better safe than sorry
Damn, who is that semen demon?
people will stop selling BCH and BTC users will be stuck holding the bag...lol
