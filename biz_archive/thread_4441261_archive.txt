the Stratis killerwait Stratis is already deadperfect opportunity for NEBLIO some may want to dump bags, but anyone who researches the project knows its tits and community driven BAAS.it's going to crush Stratis.
10% POS instead of requiring a million bucks to buy a Stratis MN.
More dev community support.
NEBL is a steal short and long.
Binance is notorious for disqualifying listings when a coin leaks their listing info prior to binance's official announcement.
It's even in their FAQ bot.
This is either a) hopefully just some fucking stupid rumourorb) something you've heard from the devs publically in which case they likely got disqualified.
God people are fucking stupid.
Trying to hype a coin and in turn fuck themselves up the ass.
