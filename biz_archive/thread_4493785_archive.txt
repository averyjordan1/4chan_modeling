>Uber
Maybe it's because I'm in the cryptosphere too long, but 100k dollars seems a bit tiny.I work in a tech startups and we pay vendors 60k for individual high precission devices sometimes.
The money isn't important.
They paid hackers so that they could pretend it never happened and not let their customers know that they were hacked.phone postingNo one who uses Uber is going to switch to Lyft because of this.It might hurt their stocks though.
This probably happened when they had the previous ceo
I had my card info stolen recently.
Probably from this shit.
