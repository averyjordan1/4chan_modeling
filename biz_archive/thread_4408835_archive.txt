Gather roundThis coin is under the radar, releasing in DecemberMost people are busy shilling the next ERC-20 Scam coin - or Hype some years old blockchain they hold too much ofI'm not.
When it hits the market, it's going to fly.
ICO was about 35cents (yes I hold)When it hits, if you can buy it cheap (anything up to $1 is cheap as fuck) Do It.This is not investment advise.

I don't exist.
Neither does this coin.
Life is a dream.If you're too lazy to google, it's fucking called Wanchain
cant wait to get JUSTed by this :(it will be the last of the ico tokens i bought around that time
wanchain is gunna be the biggest coin of december.
GL getting it for under a dollar..
You know whats upI think there's a chance it will be under a dollar briefly when it opens.
Some people only go into ICO's to flip - but catching it for under $1 will probably only happen for the first few hours
DELET
Poorfagg here.
Bought only 2 eth worth should i just end it all?
contrats you will have 10 eth in dec
Not at all!
you bought early, and will reap the rewards!But because this is 4chan - yes
You can't convert these ERC-20 tokens to coins on the wanchain blockchain unless you were part of the ICOThat's why no one's buying.
delet asshole
too early to shill it, just accumulate on ico prices
i bought at ico so expect this to crash to $0
