>satoshi's visionwhy do you think that this isn't a legitimate argument?
it is but everyone's impatient, dont worry its coming.
im comfy i bought when it was 300-400 dollars :)
$0 is coming.
because only satoshi himself can make that argument
sent :)
but he made it...
But it's not his vision.
Bigger blox lead to more centralization and huge storage requirements.
They think it isn't a legitimate argument because the idiots that follow corecoin can barely read and have never read a word of Satoshi's writing.
They don't even understand how far from the original Bitcoin what they call Bitcoin has fallen.
bigger blocks are satoshi's vision>storage requirements.its like saying he didnt envisioned expensive specialized mining hardware
I still not seeing an answer to OP's question as to why 'Satoshi's vision' is an automatic argument winner.
Why does Satoshi have to have been right about everything?
