Why isn't this coin huge?It's gotten DHS grants, it's pushing blockchain-as-a-service, which means it has an actual use-case, it's ATH is $30, but it still has a low market cap.I know about the hardfork and china bullshit, but this seems pretty undervalued.And Teeka fucking Tiwari recommends it up to FIFTY FUCKING DOLLARSGoing up, cucks
It's going up.
And the same group behind storj moon is working in this coin right now.
So hop the fuck on, this beauty will hit $30 in two days, mark these words.You faggots missed the storj rocket, don't miss this one.
That is one ugly mothetfucker.....make me rich!
well storj indeed had a good moon, might buy some
