GO UP ALREADYAT LEAST TO ICO
Day trading Shitjeets and ADHD P&D chasers are being murdered on this coin.I love it.My cashout is sometime between November and April 2018.
I'm not thinking of cashing out before August 2018, and even then, might just take what I invested plus some.
I'm looking at 2$-3$ by end of 2018 and that's when I would consider selling most/all of my stash
You think the team can deliver?There's always the possibility of something better coming out?
2-3 end of yearbit conservative eh?
Yes, I think they can.
Until now they are the most professional team I've found on the crypto space.
Bi-weekly thorough updates.
Active within the community.
Backed by actual real-value companies.
Come in to disavow FUD or unrealistically high expectations.
Are ahead of their own roadmap.
etc...
I invested little so the risk:reward ratio here is very low
they'll deliver with certainty.
if you can read code: https://github.com/RequestNetwork/Request_SmartContracts
Don't get me wrong, would be happy with 0.5$ too, but if the team delivers what they promise, and the crypto space continues to grow at this insane pace, 2$-3$ does not seem that all too optimistic
hahahaThis is what happens when you don't let amerifats join in the ICO.
That's where all the money is.
They're probably still salty about it, so they won't buy even now.
What, you think europoors are going to make it moon?
Hahahahahaha
