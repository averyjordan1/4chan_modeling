Latium token sale begins in 19 days with pre-sale opening November 15th.
I'm not usually one to invest in ICOs (been trading alts for 5 years now) but this looks pretty promising.
Anyone have any info on this project??
McAfee says this is the best shit he’s seen since blockchain was birthed.
I’m waiting for the whitelist sale (not presale) right now on 15th.
Can’t wait.
Easy 10x
With a backer like McAfee you know this is going to explode, not a bad idea to get in early on this one.
yeah it was McAfee's hype that I first came across this token.
Not sure if it's good or bad but I feel like it's a positive thing to have someone like that backing the project
