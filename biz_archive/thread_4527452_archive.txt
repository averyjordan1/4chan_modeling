This coin may be something really big.
It may also fail epically...
Either way, it's at 5M market cap, they are gonna have their token changer available in 4 days and new exchange in 7, so get in now for a quick bump in less than a week
Anon why are you still in this coin?
I don’t give A fuck about the venture capital element but the derivatives platform could be huge I’m all in for that
>Cryptopia exchangeyeah...really big right?
so glad I could dump this shitcoin at 2x
Yeah that's kind of where I stand aswell.
We've had a lot of them try VC with crypto and fail, this could be the same.
But the derivatives exchange is very interesting
check this shit out
