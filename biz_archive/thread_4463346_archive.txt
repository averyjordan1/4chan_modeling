I'm so good a trading this month its fucking crazy, went from $1300 to $4800, I invested into so many moon mission and caught them so fast, I only invest a tiny bit of my portfoli to do so as well.
I invest $300-$400 into these various moon missions and I got there, it hurt my heart many times to not invest more but I get emotional trading if I have huge amount invested so I panic and sell so what I did was only invest about 10% of my portfolio and now I'm here.
I hardly made any bade trades, my only bad trade was investing into REQ back again after I made quite a bit on it and lost $144.
What was the point of starting this thread?

Well, congratulations you got yourself a response.
You're lucky I'm feeling merciful today, or there would have been hell to pay for the near aneurysm your post caused me.
Stay in your dark moist basement and leave my board alone.
