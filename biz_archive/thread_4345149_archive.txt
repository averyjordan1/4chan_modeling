Recently launched a shopify store where I sell shirts with my designs.
What is the best way to promote them on social media?
What are the general guidelines for posting?
I don't really have a big budget for paid ads at the moment so I'm not looking into that right now.
Most of my audience would be local but I'm looking to expand by making new designs that would sell statewide and countrywide.
I doubt you're going to find a reliable answer here.
just read whatever the latest books are and put to a budget to experiment with.
don't rule out more traditional avenues depending on the target audience.
There used to be daily shopify and affiliate marketing thread.
Now it's all about coins.
Send shit to people with audiences (I don't wanna say influencers, but oh well), hope they wear your shirt, they will if it's good, very cheap way of advertising.Bonus points if you can make a design for the specific person, they'll most likely love it.
Is it worth using bots to gain followers?
