Curious about what you guys use as an exchange/ buy for more obscure coins.
Do you have favorites?
Bumping for this question, I also want to know the right answer.I want to buy some BCH right FUCKING NOW but I don't know what exchange to choose.
I think EtherDelta is the go-to exchange for obscure shit that you can't find anywhere else.
Iâ€™d like to one that allows me to transfer quickly to a coinbase account or straight to paypal so I can cash out quick.
I love coinexchange.io, I almost never lose there.
