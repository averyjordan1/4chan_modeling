china and usa are in a currency war.
dollar vs yuan nothing new so far right?but they opened a new front in crypto.
china will ban btc mining and all the chinese hash power will go to bch.
this rumor was going around since early november.meanwhile usa(le jews, banks etc) was trying to take over btc with the s2x fork so they have full controll over it.but they failed so their plan B is to rush CME("testing" starts on monday) to keep btc from crashing to the ground when the chinese redirect all hash power to bch(and this will happen in the very near future).+ they will build a huge mining farm in the USA and the great btc war between USA and le chinks will begin.
this is probably being built as we speak in utah ran by the NSA.another funny thing is how all the famous "criminal" btc supporters(mcafee, kimdotcom, ver, keiser) who are not in a friendly relationship with the usa are now supporting bchbtc:1ERYTStwc7Cmdb3YdcAAzTsJkn5yLdhLJ1
