just bought 1ETH, am i going to make it?
Yeah, you'll make that $400 into $300.Congrats buying ATH retard.
i'm not selling anytime soon, i will buy another 1ETH a week later.
probably not.
ETH will gain over time but it's mooning right now and it won't sustain, it'll probably drop back to ~$335-350 very soon
$390 - $400 range, fine & will go to $480 by December
It's going to $650

i didn't want to buy XMR when it was 140$, now i'll be lucky to see chadero stop.
