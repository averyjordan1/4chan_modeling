If so, who?
I am in the midst of writing another article.
There are tons of questions.
I don't want it to be a hit piece, but there are so many gaping holes in the business plan and team backgrounds.
The team seems huge, no VC funds are listed, and the team is going to get less than a million to split from the ICO.
Programmers generally need to eat.
No, I am not going to bother with Telegram.
Period.
Telegram is worse than Reddit.
Also, every single article that has been written on Moirai that I have found has been paid for.
I don't know why.
Most people who write articles do nothing but pump the tokens no matter what, but that is the situation.
Also, the ICO is just done through an Ether address.
As in it is open.
This while Moirai claims they will be the first regulated ICO in British history.
They also do things like say they are using Bancor protocol but then give no details.
80% of the whitepaper is fluff.
It includes awesome diagrams like this.
