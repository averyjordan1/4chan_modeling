I'm about to go to the clubWhat goals should I set for myself?Also I'd rather stayed at home
Dafuq is wrong with you
Get drunk, pop a pill, try to bang a stripper, etcit's not hard to take them home since they want to just have fun but you gotta be something they want
Talk to ten girlsTry to take them home with youDont mention your coins
You're gonna miss all the BTC/BCH action
Nigger how could you even think about going to the club at a time like this?Bitcoin is destroying itself, BCH is mooning, alts are still really low, the whole market is set to either explode or collapse and all you can think about is getting your rocks off?
Clubs are degenerate.
Stay home and trade crypto.
yeah op what are you thinking.
just jack it and trade crypto.
jack it whilst trading crypto to save more time
