I was up $600 just trading dips and got caught at .35
So glad I was too lazy to buy more
I was doing fine until Bittrex took a shit and when it came back it was trading at .29.
What the fucking fuck Bittrex.

Weak hands.
Btc went up a little bit, dont worry.
That doesn't explain that degree of sell-off brohan.
>There are whales who bought at 0.35 on BittrexI hope you rich assholes get what you deserve
I sold in time but somehow all my BTC got locked into a buy order for .38 that won't execute and won't cancel.
I'm gonna be up all night sweating over it.
why did anyone buy high?
