How is it possible for people to work from 9 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Friday, commute to work and back, exercise everyday, read a book every week to stay well read, cook and eat healthily, do all the weekly chores (which include shopping, hygiene stuff, doing the dishes, keeping your home clean, and random bullshit that arises), sleep 8 hours a night, and learn new skills or develop meaningful projects?I haven't even mentioned socialising, either through the internet or real life socialising, though both is healthy, the first to say what you really think and the latter to stop feeling pathetic.
And I haven't even mentioned other meaningful hobbiesAnd if you have a high status job then add at least 10 hours of work a week.

You socialise when training/working.
Training does not have to take more than 6 hours a week.
everyday chores does not take that much time.
Its just fucking doing it.
skills arise when working training if you are aware.
You literally just have to stop gaming/lurking 4chan and you will realise how much time you have everyday.
basically stop doing nothing.
Most people don't

Work is not intellectually edifying if you are in any career with good prospects.
This is fact.The programmer at Google does harder work than a guy at McKinsey.
We all know who has better prospects
