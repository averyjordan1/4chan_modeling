When I bought NEO in 2017(Currently 2089), I noticed there was a very good chance it would challenge Ethereum.
If you'll notice young ones, Ethereum is 1/3 more in coinage thus for Neo to match it's per coin price it would only have to be 10 billion in marketcap.
That sits it right underneath Bitcoin cash.
Back in my day I remember that Bitcoin cash hodlers began to jump ship and sell right into NEO propelling it further off due to Chinese Government positivity.
This began an intense buying period, the likes which most have never seen since the Trump presidential/1000 BTC rise in your timeline.
I remember it well, I am imparting this to you from another dimension.........where Hillary won...........no money in the world can save us.
Please enjoy your dimension.
DO YOUR KEGELS.
