The sheer level of naivety of this place amazes me.
Ask yourself, what should a cryptocurrency be worth?
What is the correct price?
$0.
All of them should be worth $0.
They do not pay dividends like actual businesses.
Their value is not derived from a population of taxpayers like a fiat currency.
There's nothing backing them.
They're just ideas.
Good ideas, yes, but nothing more than that.Sure, you can make a lot of money on them.
But you won't.
Because today you think you will make more money tomorrow.
And you will, so you put more money in.
And then one day the crash will come and you think you will be quicker than everyone else and get out but you won't because there will be no buyers and no liquidity whatsoever because everyone knows all this shit is speculating over the value of an interesting thought experiment.But I'm just another anon, what the fuck do I know?
You're just a random anon, what the fuck do you know?
Fuck off poorfag lmao
Heard this shitty argument at $10, $100, $1000, and now when we're nearing $10,000... And every single major price point in between.Stay poor nocoiner.
they do not pay dividendsStopped reading there, they do idiot.

Ask yourself, what should a piece of paper called 'money' be worth?
What is the correct price?
$0.
All of them should be worth $0.
They do not pay dividends like actual businesses.
Their value is not derived from actual utility like gold, milk or eggs.
There's nothing backing them.
They're just ideas.
Good ideas, yes, but nothing more than that.Sure, you can make a lot of money on them.

Systems of exchange that ensure anonyminity>International transaction times of a few seconds>Distributed computation power economy>Worthless ideasYeah, you tell me which one of these things is not like the other.
stay poor, poorfag
 NEO gives me about $0.22/month while my $30 stocks give me the same dividend a quarter+ the dividend from NEO is going up in price while usd is stagnating
the next financial crisis will kill the people who's lives are built on debt.
God help you if you are not holding precious metals and crypto next year.you can only help yourself anonhttp://pricedingold.com/http://didthesystemcollapse.com/http://www.macro-investing-strategy.com/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVN9MPWEmYc
I don't understand basic economic principles, but please take me seriously
>But I'm just another anon, what the fuck do I know?You got that right.You're just like the American democrat brainlets who look at rural folks and conclude anything the right-wing says is stupid and wrong by association.Yes, /biz/ is mostly stupid, but the idea of cryptocurrency is revolutionary.
Currency exists as a means to facilitate interpersonal exchanges, and for the first time in history we have access to a currency that isn't falsifiable, in both senses of the word: can't make fake money, can't print money like a government either thanks to cryptographically secure and provable inflation models.Cryptocurrency is a step towards the abolishment of coercion through force.
It cannot be adopted by governments as such, and yet by becoming big enough it might drive changes such as countries adopting blockchain technology and rolling out their own currencies with associated tax plans, and the greater transparency, accountability, fairness that comes with a public ledger.Why would govs do that?
Because the technology is out there.
If you don't adopt it, some other country is going to, and will attract capital.
Estonia already does this in Europe, let's see how they end up 10 years from now.
Yup, fiat is completely infallible and will always retain its value.
Hyperinflation has never ever happened.
Economies have never collapsed.
It's just bitcoin that's speculation.
Nothing else.
Let's pretend the literal hundreds of trillions of dollars that banks are currently leveraging doesn't exist.
I've made 2.3MM dollars in under a year.
I've cashed out 600k already.I'm 26.
I've made more than some of my colleagues will make in their lifetime.
>I'm just another anon, what the fuck do I know?Apparently nothing.
You are brainlet who can read but cannot comprehend.
And most importantly cannot make a swift and correct decision.
So now you are bitter for missing crypto gain train.And you know that you will miss even the next big thing, because you are spastic brainlet :)
