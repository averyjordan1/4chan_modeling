>people on this board post wojaks about losing 1000$do you realize how little that is?
It adds up over time.
yeah but you're not gonna get 100% right no matter what, you make 1000$ you lose 1000$ and yet people still just flood the board with pinkies for something that really barely matters
mfw $1000 is literally 3 month's living cost in EE>yfw not everyone in the entire universe is a burger
Ikr
even then that's 3 months, maybe 1/300th of your lifespan and you probably aren't living on 4000$/year anyway
>make more money in a week than most wagecucks makes in a year
it's more than what your mother makes in a year, you basement dweller larper
yea because my mother doesn't work since my family isn't poor
AUDSo, that'll equate to about $0.02 in USD then.
WHEN CRYPTO IS ALL YOU CAN DO BECAUSE THE NEET LIFE HAS ITS CLAWS IN YOU YES ITS A LOT
not everyone lives in liberal dystopian city where $1000 gets you a third of a month's rent.
XD
Yet we get a lot of shills here.
Wants to buy lambo.>Upset over $1000 losing swing
Don't tell me you actually believe the larp on here?
$1000 is more than most people on this board see in a month.
And then next week you lose more money than third worlders make in a decade.
Fpbp
You havent made shit until you have cashed out
