You have ten seconds to explain why you are not invested in this man.
Chink
Because he died this morning
Because he's done nothing but be lucky
cause im investing in REQ
He's 70% of my portfolio.
Originally was only about 10% but then it became Neo
He is still not doing enough on promoting NEO in his native China.
Most volume comes from abroad.
He is focusing on the Chinese Gov first.
NEO is perfect for digital identity and asset management that the Chinese government will love.
When the Chinese gov is on board with NEO, then the population will come.
I'm all in on NEO, VEN, LRC and LOMO.
Where exactly do you think you are?
It sounds kinda gay to say 'I'm invested in this man'.
