So is this shit now?
Did I buy a worthless shitocin at .0008 and .001 eth?
Am I dumb?
Stop buying shitcoins!
How many times do you have to be told that the coin is not even 2 weeks old.
Just fucking sell if you want to sell already jfc
It's just stressful to watch, just last week everyone was touting this up to be just like powerledger.
How do I know which ones are shit and should stay away from?
This one looked great but maybe not idk.
why did it drop after listing on Kucoin?
Only reason I'm in this is for the short term 2x when it got on exchanges, how the fuck is this not gonna drop to like 5 cents when it gets to cryptopia at this rate?
Because Kucoin is a "literally who" exchange most people don't even know exists.
At least wait for Cryptopia.$1 EOY
Does this have anything on the horizon for the rest of the year?
(pun intended)
