I see people selling their coins because they have made profit in USD but end up with less BTC than when they bought it.
hey fucking idiot if you buy FIRSTBLOOD at 100 sats and then sell them at 50sats, even though you may have made 10bucks cash profit in your blockfolio app, you STILL LOST BTC.
This is the state of biz, cant even do math
if you look at coinbase, most graphs are like this:USD price going up, BTC price fluctuating up and down but trending to the same shit.Might as well keep it all on BTC and be safer

Obviously Bitcoin is going to outpace everything else until the end of time and no other outcome is possible

learn about unit of account
implying you can reliably time the market in the way you want/thread
have u heard of TA u brainlet?
t. brainlet without perfect market timing
The only time I sell for less sats than I bought at is when I plan to quickly short and jump back in at even less sats.The only justification for selling for mo money less sats would be if you were going to pull it out into fiat immediately right?
Sadly this.
TA is modern day witchcraft.
Sorry, Dumbledore, but markets are irrational.
Dont have to time it perfectly to pull something like that off.
You know, you just play breakdowns and breakouts.
Its not.
Its easily explained.
You play the setups you like at minimal risk levels.
If it breaks down, you sell for minimal loss.
If it breaks up, you follow the chart and let it ride until the pattern starts to weaken.
But move up your stop losses constantly so your 15%+ gain doesnt drop to a 5%+ loss.
Cut the losers early, lets the winners run.
Its not magic, its playing odds.
this one knows what's up.
silence him!
