I have been unemployed for 3 years(!)
because of schizophrenia.
Yes I was pretty much a nutcase during that time.
My life basically got reset.
I have no network and no social circle rely on.
What I do have is a fair bit of savings money to the point I can easily survive another 2-3 years without working but that isn't what I want to do.
I want to start working or get a stable stream of income.
I can easily afford going to college and get a degree or a masters if something would be really essential and lucrative in the near future (I have a somewhat generic Bachelor of Business Administration degree already).
Or maybe some certification to show I have skills to offset the big employment gap.
Basically how do you get your life back on track and start a career under these circumstances?
How are you dealing with your schizophrenia?
Are you capable of maintaining a healthy relationship?
One day at a time.Set small goals that are easy to achieve so you can gradually build up to larger more ambitious goals.Do not try to eat the whole elephant at once or you will demoralize yourself and want to give up.
use your powers to predict the next moon missions
Also get plenty of sleep/have a rigid sleep schedule.That's super fucking important.People who are all "I'll sleep when I'm dead" are shooting themselves in the foot in the long run.
Have you ever eaten psilocybin?
whats schizo like

I used to work in College welfare and you're far from alone.
Main thing is DO NOT STOP TAKING YOUR MEDICATION.
Otherwise you end up performing an exorcism on yourself (well, if African) as a colleague of mine experienced.
