What kind of idiot pays $8300 for ONE shitcoin that can't be used to pay anything and that can't even process transactions?
and what kind of moron forgets that just a few years ago that shitcoin sold for less than $30?
because some greater fool will buy it from them for 10k
a smart one that knows 5 figures is just around the corner
u mad
You do realize that you can buy less than ONE Bitcoin?
its manipulated by tether
