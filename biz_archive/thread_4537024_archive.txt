453773045377454537786Sent but only $1 now.
Anyone wants $1 I might do a few more but it's getting tiring pasting addresses into my Android wallet.
Probably not worth it for such a small amount but who knows, maybe you'll all be buying lambos with it one day.
oh well thanks bro
TY kind person!18Rk5fzSorh9cRePbP4Qx3EMVK44veG4CV
HE1n9wZH1KLpK7ShLhE2bJQ3SbBnToWkgthank you ....
Thanks so much man :), appreciated!
4537825Also sent.
One reason I loved bitcoin is that you could send small amounts of money to people across the internet really fast and cheap.
Wasn't possible for a long time until bitcoin cash came along.
BCH truly is the bitcoin I originally bought into.
I'm not rich or anything, but if nothing it's just nice to send a dollar to someone without having to spend 5 times as much or more on fees :)4537854Sent!
Cheers man!

thx friend glad to go to the moon with you
This thread is fuckin pathetic.Even asking for $1 handouts.
Have you no pride?
Welcome to biz newfag
The 100k pajeets shilling BCH 24/7 do it for less
Sent to the last addresses posted.
I'm out now.
Hope you enjoy, and let's see if OP is right and we reach $3000 today.
Personally I'm not sure it'll happen so fast, but certainly in the long run I have high hopes for BCH.
Reckon we'll see a nice rise today anyway - here's hoping the dollars I sent can buy you all beers soon.
Bless your sweet heart my friend
I just can't buy any coin in the shithole I live in, takes like 3 days to buy bitcoin
Hello sir i would like to receive also $1 its really much for me, i am refugee on Finland and everything is expensive here.
I need to send money every month to my parents to morocco and my brother.
I need that $1 mucher than anyone hereMy bch1LBRrsDbDJjuEiRaYqb7k16KqDt8hgSjRL
Oh look, another BCH bagholder who bought at $2400.My advice: take advantage of the current high to sell at a lower amount of loss before it gets dumped for BTG, the new kid on the block.
The dude sending it is just using it as a way to keep the thread bumped, so please see BCH on the front page and FOMO and buy it.Good for me because I'm balls deep in BCH right now lmao
This goes to show how absolutely clueless you are
Ok sent, but get a job m8, hope you aren't just taking government gibs to send to another country.4538190What's wrong with giving away money?
Even if they are small amounts, what's it to you?
Classic Cories, thinking bitcoin is only meant to be a store of value... And BTG?
Hah!
so cynical .....
reddit spacing>subtle core shillingback you go

Honestly I am trying to show the virtues of BCH, but not by keeping the thread bumped - more just proving that bitcoin can actually be used for transactions again.
Won't try to convince you personally though... have a nice day bud.
doesn't realise the quiet accumulation of BTG is happening right now while he's focused on BCH
Fair enough man.
I agree BCH is great because you can actually send $1 without paying $5 for fees.
I'm a BCH man myself.Just usually threads like this have posts like that to keep up top.
Anyway, you too.
Saying 'reddit spacing' seriouslyNewfags plz go
Sold all my BTG already for BCH.
I don't care if the price goes up, I'm in BCH because it's actually useful for something.
I think because of the utility the value will go up (and stay up).
If something only has value for the sake of having value, it's too fragile so I'm not gonna bother.
Don't have anything against people speculating on that kind of crypto, it's just not what I'm in it for.Nice to hear.
I get you, and yes I'll admit keeping the thread bumped is a positive too - just not my main intention.
Wouldn't mind a bit of FOMO buying, as long as people are getting in for the long term and we have merchant adoption too!
Is BTG Blockstream's escape vehicle?
Thanks for the donation
you'll probably start caring when BTG starts shooting up at the same time BCH starts dumping, don't say I didn;t warn you.The signs are already there, good luck.
Please send more.
I need one dollar more
OMG.
Thanks ANON!
Oh wow OP delivers danke!
Ever heard of PayPal?
That has fees n is annoying

not even a thank youKill yourself.
Get a fucking job.
Received it, thanks man.Didn't immagine this to be such a long thread.
