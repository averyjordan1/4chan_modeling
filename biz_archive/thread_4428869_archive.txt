Another friendly reminder that IOP will be the coin to boom soon.> I was right about NEO (ANS from 1$).

It may take a few days, few weeks even before the real pump so better start accumulating now.Why IoP?
In the next month or so:> Whitepaper coming> Roadmap coming> Official marketing campaing> New exchanges> They already have beta messenger released (it provides better privacy then any out there)> Partnership with Libertania> Amazing devs (they will do livestream where they will make what IOTA wants to make in just a couple of hours)> Making separate exchange where coins (same as ICO) could be purchased with IOP> Hydra airdrop (for any IOP on the wallet you have a chance to get airdrop of hydra) and that is just the start> Low circulation (around 2m coins)> Just got out of stealth > Really low market cap of less then 7m$> Active community, there is always someone on telegram or discord> FFS buy it or cry laterDon't trust me?
