Got great gains from NEO POWR SUB EOS NULS.
I'm also holding DCR UBQ and ARK, these guys are a slob, a faliure, haven't even recovered in the slighest.
I in green with them but I expected when the fork was done they'll go back to the norm.
Anyone can redpill me on these bunch of slobs?
Is it because bitcoin is hovering at $7800?
