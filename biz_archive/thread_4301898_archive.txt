I currently hav $35k in Metaverse ETP, $15k in BCC and $10k in BTC...Should I move all my BCC and BTC into Metaverse?
If ETP does hit $12-15 dollars from it's current price of $3.10 then I'll have a quarter million.I know I'm going to get a lot of bullshit biztarded shilling but looking for guidance here because I'm also a biztard.
is it going anywhere soon?why not move when it breaks out like above $4-5?
with that kind of money i'd rather loose 10% of the gains than sit with bags
me on the left
It won't break to $12 instantly, it would go to $5, dip back down to $4, etc.Do you know anything about trading?
What you're describing is literally buying high selling low.
three to five dollars is a 60% gain.

three to five dollars is a 60% gain.yeah no shityou see $5 breakout and buy $4 dip to hold geniusif you want to scalp 3 to 5 you obviously shouldn't care if it goes to 12-15
"little gains" such as the 33% from 3 to 4 matter.
They especially matter when the price is low.1 to 5 is 5x.
5 to 10 is 2x.
What kind of gains would you rather see?
Idiot.
ugh its your money i dont give a fuck in what bags you gonna keep them before it decides to pump again, because it just did 5x less then a month ago
