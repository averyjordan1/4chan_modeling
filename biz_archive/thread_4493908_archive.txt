>that time you sold powr at 2500 sats to go all in on astro at .007 eth
Sell your bags and get on the rocket.
You have time.
POWR is bouncing around 8k.
When it breaks 8.5k resistance, and then again at 9k, we are fucking barreling through 10k.
Might even hit 12k.Get.
In.
No we aren't.
It already pumped for today.
Will drop back to 6k minimum or 7k highest.
Don't listen to these people trying to get you to hold their bags.
DO NOT BUY POWR AT TIHS MOMENT.
Wait for it to drop back.
Thank me later.
Ok when do you think the next pump is?
I traded for neo, doesnt hurt as much as passing on it when it first listed on binance cause lolsolar what a gimmick no product till 2019
