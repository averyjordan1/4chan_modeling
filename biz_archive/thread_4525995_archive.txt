> all your friends are crypto daytraders> they make money daily> you long term hodl your shitcoinsHow do I convince myself, that holding is better in the long run
do both
You dont hold shitcoins long term.
Youre suppose to cash out on the quick gains and put it back into Btc
Hold your picks of the top 20.Day trade your alts.Most shitcoins aren't worth holding.
Eth, you mean
You don't.
Because daytrading actually is more profitable.> pic related
you probably learned the hold meme from biz or reddit or something... it's literally meant to convince people into a bad situation, people want you holding and losing profits, not competing against them on the market.I shouldn't even say this since I'm now one of them, but yea that's how it is.
I was holding for like 8 months straight and in the same boat as you.
Finally I took the plunge, started daytrading, making 1-5% per day and living off my earnings full time.
Plus it's actually really fun.
holding is better if you are brainlet like myself and most people, 90% buy high and sell low.
Your friends aren't making money daily if they are trading.
They're lying to you, bud
