If i were to print out tons of sticker sheets with crypto related shit, and sold them, could i be sued?
Yes 4chan himself would sue you for everything you and your family has
Just accept Zcash only and you'll be fine.
stop trying to scam /biz/ you retarded plushtard
ye its me, how the hell do people know.But this is not a scam, i was gonna list them on ebayim just curious if (for bigger coins like monero) there are actually people that go against such things
haha rekt instantlyhow much did you make from /biz/?
And you only made one plushie, didn't you?
that is correct, i made 500$, Which is around 13 People that i scammed.Now, it was never meant to be like that, i genuinely liked making plushies.
But then people started telling me how shitty they were and (i thought so too) that they were not worth more than 20$.
Now if i only charged 20$ i would have gone negative, and when everyone was sending me money left and right i realised that there was no sort of buyer protection - if they sent it via eth.I feel genuinely bad about that and have told people to contact me if they lost money to me.
(i didnt save any adresses) but only one guy has contacted me so far.
Nice man.
You've definitely solidified a spot in the /biz/ annals of infamy.
Hope that $500 turns into major gainz for you.
I actually plan on making up for it with sending stuff to anons for free.
Nothing big, just a bunch of stickers (letters dont cost as much to ship)I still love entertaining biz, a lot of threads that made many people laugh ( with actual original content ) were made by me, and i wanna keep doing that without being called out on my scam each time.
oooooooooooooOOOOOoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooOOOOoo *rattles chainlink*
