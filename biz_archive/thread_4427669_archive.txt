O-okay I'll guess I'll use the $300 I have left in my NEET bank account r-right?
Hop in, senpai.When king reaches $10k normies will go bananas!
Normies will buy options to short this shitcoin to oblivion.
And you guys will be happily buying them thinking it goes to the moon.
Then chain death occurs.
Have fun bitchcoiners
Literally this :).
Btc was the best workhorse for crypto imaginable, but as all first movers, the competition will come, and destroy it.
BTC is an epic coin and i love it but it is not the real solution, and ocne mainstream hits it, it will die.
