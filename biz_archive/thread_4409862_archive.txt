Hello, guys!
I have a project in my university that involves working on an idea in legal tech.
First step is presenting some solution and explaining why would it be useful.Idea as it exists already is that there should be some basic stuff (like system of documents version control, cloud services for storing data, etc.)
and also customizable options.
So what utilities would you recommend?
What do you use already and find convenient/inconvenient?
What do such systems lack?

Please do the work for me.You are more likely to get a helpful response if you show that you have already done some legwork.
That's way too vague.
Help us out here.
