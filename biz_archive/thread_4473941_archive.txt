Sniff sniff,I smelled some dummies on this site and I love meeting dummies!
They make my lined pockets grow!
Since you all have helped me make hundreds of thousands, I will let you in on a little secret: The tamico team doesn't exist!
We made them up to sound more official!
The Dec 4th rebranding was the perfect time span to start planning for the dump.
Since I've been so nice to you all now, please go ahead and buy some more odn.
We will pump it one last time to get a final round of dummies!Regards,Your community leader, S.M.
Be gone, satan.
Blackstone and team will not betray us.
SnnnnnnnnnnnnSnnnnnnnnnnnIs that money I smell?
Now that you mention it tamico has no history and i cant find shit on previous projects they worked on.
Where is there website too?
Ceo hasnt said a word in over a month also
I cant believe people on here keep falling for these pajeet scams.
All the knowledgeable oldfags have clearly left this board months ago, or just stay silent for the laughs.
I can't believe there is anyone on this board who would actually buy Obsidian or Cuckfido
ODN will succeed.
