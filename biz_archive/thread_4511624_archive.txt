Hopefully not yet, just got out to get a better buy-in.

4511637we'll we just had an announcement of wallet compatibility with leger wallet, and we are starting to break out of our btc trend, we are also holding support above 600 million market cap and $0.035, plus bull flag on marketcap and USD price, and supposed developments coming end of november, so, I'd say any day now.if you're on kraken keep an eye out for flash dips, it's not odd for the price to dump 10 to 15 percent then recover within minutes.
I've been setting low buys to catch and flip those movements for easy gains, but now I'm just holding on for the next few days because breakout seems imminent.hell, i'm exstatic because despite missing a x15 in the past 3 weeks on power, almost all of my shit is either preparing for a moon, or already on a very nice upswing.money is really flowing into alts form recent btc rally and stabilization between 8k and 8.5k,
Source?
Any announcement made by them will moon it.
