Blockfolio rate thread.I'm gonna give myself a 6/10
get the fuck out of tether, liquidate your shitcoins (xlm, kmd) and get ready to sell your btc to catch the second wave of the alt pump after bitcoin's fork (attempt).
How am I holding up?
I’ve got 5k link I haven’t added yet, but otherwise it’s accurate.
I give myeself a 2/10 for almost being as boring as 100% btc
I dont even know what Im doing anymore
why is anyone holding obsidian anymore?
it can only go up...r-right?
no it can still keep falling to basically zero
I'm gonna make it right guys?????
having such little holdings in altcoinswhy do this?
I give myself a 7/10

I think it's a decent buy.
biz may tell you otherwise.

At 15k sat.
I got in when they were around .44 cents
Am i ever going to 2x?Feels like i bought every coin at ath.i bought odn at 66k

4242124Last one.
ODN bless
let me take a second to say ... you are the fucking man!
neomah boy, get some more.
shit is going interstellar this quarter
why the fuck would anyone buy ODN?did you guys not reserach the worthless product?mark cuban tried something similar and failed
I think you're set for some good gains after the fork
Fud
 No DOVU
that makes me hopeful ... first to market often fails ...
Mark Cuban wouldn't know what to invest in unless someone goes on Shark Tank and says "hey you can sell this in the Maverick's arena"

Plus my bags

a portfolio that will make me the million in a few monthsand after that 10 in a few years
Alt coins are literally the fucking shitty penny stocks of crypto.
Why the fuck woukd I put money into some shitty no name coin that biz pumps and dumps to scam 3/4 of investors.
The ICO explosion has absolutely destroyed the credibility of anything ERC20 related.
Have fun with your bags of shitty fuckboi coins, im on a bitcoin moon mission.
because we're smarter than you :^)
I'm deluded
Sort by Holdings REEEE
Thoughts?
Needs BTC.
This is me.
>Loving this WTC dip/10

4243339How did you guys change the theme on blockfolio?
/10 too many coins, decent selection though
Reading this made me sad, I have a similar portfolio to that anon but more heavy on LINK and I literally owned 15btc at the start of october and now it's a mere 7.It's really going to take a year to fucking recover from the justing i took from LINK and other alts?
fuck me
Start of October was just a month ago... You lost 10 BTC in that time?!?!?
Holy fuck.
8/10At least I'm prepared for the flippening.. just in case
Well 8btc but yeah it’s been terrible, it’s pretty much brought my depression back and I’ve been skipping uni and meeting friends.This all started as 0.3btc so it’s all profit and not real money but it’s really hard not to get upset over it
4244332same exact shit anonim the poster, idk if my id changed because im on desktopthat btc is just some link bags i soldall i need is to recover back to maybe 10 before the end of the month and i can live with myselfotherwise ive officially not made it
in UNI>have ~7 BTC>wants to suicide because "did not make it">first world problems
We picked some good alts, did our own research, had faith in our coins and we got absolutely fucked when a bunch of normies heard about bitcoin again.I really hope you make it back bro, at least you're not alone in the suffering
>measuring your portfolio in btc>not owning any btc
Pls gib ratesThat 10 ETH is actually in STORM token right now
4244373Hmm imagine 200k from 2015, now i'm down to 2.5k.Just imagine i'm still here because I know where crypto is going to go in 2018-2019 anyways.Just come to /biz/ to kill time and memes nothing else.Well it was a combination of a girl and /biz/ though kek.
having that much of your portfolio in alts
Pls no bully feeling suicidal as is
