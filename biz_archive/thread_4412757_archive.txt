YOU FUCKING FAGGOTS SAID THIS WOULD MOON TO A HUNDRED TODAY
The day is young.
It pumped up 14% in an hour yesterday with no notice.
being this impatient Dude just compare the BTC and LTC charts throughout the last year.
Every time Litecoin moons, and with the new upgrades it got yesterday, it'll be a surefire once BTC settles.
I'VE BEEN HOLDING THIS COIN EVER SINCE I BOUGHT IT AT $80 A FEW MONTHS BACK.
GOD DAMNIT I'M GONNA GO FUCKING NUTS
why is it only litecoin fags that have a hard on for the fiat value.
did you guys buy this shit on coinbase with your credit card?
bought it at 80You poor soult.
bought in at 62You can't buy groceries with crypto
FUCKING PUMP THIS COIN NOW OR IM GOING TO KILL YOU
btc goes up in terms of fiat>ltc goes down in terms of btc but stays stable in terms of fiat>I made a solid investment in a stable growing assetyou get more fiat for your groceries if you start understanding that all supports, resistances, and trends are pegged to btc.
its playing out the exact same fractaal from the last pump to ATH.Have patience.
I've invested in BTC as well as LTC.
Long term LTC is a good fiat grower
