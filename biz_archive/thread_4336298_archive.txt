Iâ€™m a newfag, what you think about the portfolio?
Bought some stuff and just let it there for some time (2-3 years).
Not interested in day trading... is there a chance to make it?
REQ> LINKYou made it man.
The both of us.
Now, we just have to wait.
You'll make it.
Probably.
No chance of making it.
I'm like 15% sure you made it
x investment needed, at min, ideally 100xthis is just playing
Cool!
Well I think to put some money in from time to time and just let it go.

You're gonna make it on link alone anon
What can be expected for LINK in the next 12 months?
When did you buy LINK?
I hope not before SIBOS.At worst, no change in price in relation to Bitcoin.
Means it can double its value.
At worst.
