Try to talk me out of buying BCH right now.As soon as bitcoin tumbles down again (which I figure won't be too long), people will panic sell and a lot of that might go to BCH again I think.Any arguments against?
(BTC will be 50mil by end of 2017 is NOT a valid argument)
to me yes it looks like a great buy right now, buy the BTC/BCH ratio dip imo
Lol sure
I am autistic, is this sarcasm?
