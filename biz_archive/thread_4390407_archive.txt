WTF biz, i stopped looking at my blockfolio until after the supposed Segwit2x fork.
I am still JUSTed by LINK the fuck?
I bought a week before SIBOS.
I'm going to hold for 1 to 2 years but now I dont have any choice but to join a "zen and finding the meaning of life" support group so that i can chill.Fuck you biz.
Hopefully there are hot chicks in the support group as an upside to all this fuckery.
