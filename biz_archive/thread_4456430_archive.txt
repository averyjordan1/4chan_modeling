I'm killing myself tonight.
don't kill yourself.
Let it be a lesson to you.
You earned that 20k once, you can do it again I'm sure.
How much did you lose?What did you buy?Are you gonna kill yourself?If so, when?
MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR KEGELS OP.
HAVING 20K AND LOSING IT DOESN'T MEAN A THING IF YOUR DICK ISN'T IN TIP TOP SHAPE.
I'VE LOST 800,000 DOLLARS TRADING AND I AM STILL RICH BECAUSE I CAN HOLD MY PELVIC FLOOR FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE.
I AM FIT TO BEAR, THAT'S ALL THAT WOMEN CARE.
Max out your credit cards in Vegas and put it all on black if you win youâ€™re back if you lose then def kill yourself
k is fuck all, dude, you'll bounce back in a year.
Not worth dying forever over.
Crypto hasn't even really gotten started yet.
Don't fucking kill yourself.
Get back into something relatively safe and stay there.
In a small way, if thats all you're able.
In as much time as it takes.
In a few years, you'll look back at that time you almost killed youeself over 20k and realize how fucking stupid that would have been.
bless you

I wonder if the people still buying Confido on kucoin realize that is is a dead project now
Buy the dip anon!
20k is what you make in less than a year in a wagecuck job, so why would you kill yourself?
Just wait for the next altcoin season to cover your losses.
I lost 20K in 2 weeks.
I know you're pain.
It hurts a lot to lose money, but gotta just keep on trucking I guess
Imagine putting a really low order for confido, thinking someone might fall for it, going to sleep happilly and waking up losing couple thousands
hitbtc & kucoin always have the best flash deals since dumb impatient people don't check the size of the order book before they crush itif you fags aren't impatient you can make a ton of money playing some of these low volume pairings right
post a hot tip like this>the thread dries upevery time.
Are you suffering from leprosy, my man?
