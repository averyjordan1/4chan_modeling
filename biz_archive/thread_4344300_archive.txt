DAMN BROWHATS CRAZY IS YESTERDAY THEY SAID THE PUMP WOULD BE AT 2PM ESTTHEY WERE FUCKIN RIGHTWOW
Yes because being completely monolithic to the point of denying obvious solutions is healthy for the growth of the market.
BTC is just an example of people attempting to monopolize the market.
Breaking this up will cause chaos, but ultimately be much better for crypto in the future.
Unconfirmed transactions are stacking up for BTC.
Miners have already switched but we won't be able to tell results until 5 more blocks are mined (7 hours or so I think).
All those people who are still waiting for a confirmation about to get fucked up.Get ready for a Bitcoin Bankrun
fuck out of here you dumb faggot.
MINERS ARE SWITCHING BACK TO BCH, I REPEAT, MINERS ARE SWITCHING BACK TO BCHhttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions

!i transacted 4 btc an they are fucking stuck for 3 days.Lets be honest, who needs a fucking currencie that doesnt work?i could use fiat instead of that crap.
Oh bitcoin, much invention, much shit, much money, much rich,Bought BCC instead with my spare btc
There's a small dump going on for some reason.
Holding bags at 0.2350000.
Am i going to be ok?
Also if flipening does occour when would be a good time to sell?
And do i sell for btc or usdt?
Since btc is fucking jammed n all.
scared holders from last pump are getting out, they will regret this big time
on binance you can sell into eth, personally i'd just hold
You'll be fine, dont sell until we hit .5 tonight when korea wakes up
Have you seen the huge sell wall around 0.3800000?
Its gonna drop hard again when it gets that high up.Ppl still dumping this shit like crazy.
Will it even reach 2000$+?
I'm dumping this tonight like a fat guy after Taco Bell.
Give up bch losers, you lost.
The chart looks like every pnd ever and now it will bleed value for the next 8 months.
Enjoy your losses
How will the flipening even happen if all the btc ppl are locked in unconfirmed transactions?
Its still pumping though.. weak hands getting out.
Old bitcoin = Uncorrupted SarumanSegwit bitcoin = Corrupted SarumanBitcoin cash = Gandalf
