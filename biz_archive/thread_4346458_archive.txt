Hashrate only matters when you have transactions.
There are no transactions for BCH when everything is in exchanges.
What the fuck is wrong with you people, you're buying into stupid buzzwords believing they will matter if you believe hard enough in them.
It's a 100% psychological market right now, with no fundamentals, no technology, just slogans.
Tail is wagging you hard.
BCH bags must be so fuckin heavy now lolll
you retarded faggot, when btc transactions take over a week there will be a panic
BIZ LIES TO ME!
NOW IM FUCKING DUMPING MY BAGS AT A LOSS :( FUCK U BIZ.
Its making the BTC backlog worse though
you're buying into stupid buzzwords believing they will matter if you believe hard enough in them>he doesn't believe in meme magicyou're never gonna make it anon
I really don't give a shit about BCH but yes...yes it fucking does.
Not so much in that BCH having a higher hashrate makes it more valuable, but in BTC having a lower hash rate makes it less valuable...at least until a BTC difficulty adjustment.
They won't because BCH will be already dumped back then.THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TWO MONTHS AGO YOU GENIUS.
And back then BCH reached 0.5 BTC just to fall down into $300 territory forever.
I wish I screencaped all the excited 'flippenning' posts from back then.I've warned you so many times but you didn't listen.
This was a last desperate attempt to overthrow BTC and it failed miserably.
