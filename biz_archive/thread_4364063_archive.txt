Why is this coin perma 0.20 USD?
Laughing my ass off right now thinking about all of the stupid shills that actually thought this basement conference would do anything for this trash coin.
Not talking about Swell.. That was a month ago noob.
Ripple been hovering around 0,20 for over half a year now.
Well I am talking about Swell, dummy.
perma 0.20 USDSad but true.
Every time it pumps, it’s an opportunity to take your profit and run, because it will go right back down to 0.20.
It had one initial pump, up to like 0.40 or 0.50 I believe, and ever since then it’s been stuck in the 0.20 range with the very rare pump to 0.30 followed by the sink back down to 0.20Reminds me of LINK.
Heh
