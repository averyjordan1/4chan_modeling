If you memeline drawers have taught me anything, POWR is about to break out.
But which direction?
Up or down?
up, slight bump now that people see that it survived PnD, wont go too crazy though, POWR is the long game
it hit the 6000 new floor and going to slighly moon in next days, then land to higher floor
up.
Gonna go to 5k
