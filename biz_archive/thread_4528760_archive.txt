ZENCASHIt is starting...SECURENODS RELEASE IN A FEW DAYS.Will do a similar moon than NEOGet in now.
It's finally moving.
what are "securenodes" a shitter version of znodes?
End to end encryptions.
Went all in on Weds.I predict $40 by December.
$60 EOY$200 March 2018
Got in early feeling /comfy/, should follow the XMR moon
Monero is 2.5 billion and DASH is 4.5 billion.There is so much potential for gains here.
Best privacy coin by farSecure nodes should pay more but they reward miners who can blame them.
lmao if you don't go balls deep on this.It is going to be a rocketship in the next few days.
ZEN is gonna be the number one privacy coin.
This coin will make people rich in the future.
It can only goes up, at worse sell one day before the announcement
This.
Worst case scenario it "only" becomes the third best privacy coin, and has a market cap of over 1 billion.Put in $10k now and that's over $150 grand.
Wish I had more.
I really look forward to small "flippening" like XMR vs ZEN, that would be SO fun to watch haha.
More like ZEC vs ZEN, and XMR vs DASH.
I mean endgame is ZEN vs the finalist out of XMR and DASH right?
Or are these coins still different use cases despite both being privacy centric?sounds comfy nontheless
