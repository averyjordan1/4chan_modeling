To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand ChainLINK.
The concept is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the mechanics will go over a typical bitcoiner's head.
There’s also Sergey's hedonistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Olesha's literature, for instance.
The linkies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these connections, to realise that they’re not just practical- they say something deep about Sergey's gut.
As a consequence people who dislike LINK truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Sergey's existential catchphrase “Munch Crunch Slurp Slurp” which itself is a cryptic reference to Orwell's epic Animal Farm.
I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Rory's genius wit unfolds itself on their github screens.
What fools.. how I pity them.
And yes, by the way, i DO have a ChainLINK tattoo.
And no, you cannot see it.
It’s for the ladyboys’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
