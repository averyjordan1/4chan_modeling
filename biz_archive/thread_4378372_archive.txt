Is it worth it to have credit?
Ive been avoiding any form of debt like the plague, paying for everything in cash or with my debit card.
I dont really like knowing that Im gonna owe someone or something money so i just try to avoid it but is that a realistic way to live in this day and age?
I hate the credit card meme too.
But it all depends on your goals.
if you are responsible there is nothing wrong with a little debt, just don't be a dumbass with it
Depends what you're buying.
I bought Â£40k worth of BitCoin with a loan and have doubled my money in the span of a few months.
I was scared for awhile too.
But I only use my credit card for gas/groceries and pay it off in full every month.
Ez.

What did he mean by this?
If you ever need a loan (buying a house, starting a business, auto) then yeah you need credit.
No one is giving you any money with no credit score.Get a credit card.
Pay it off every month.
You are never "in debt" until you start missing payments.
Just don't rack up charges and let them ride for months.

This.
I use my credit cards exclusively for paying my online bills (like Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc).
Also car loans are stupid.
Just save and buy a car or buy what you can afford if you need it now.
They depreciate too fast and that's reflected by the hit your credit score takes when you have an active car loan.
Mortgages are different.
If you have steady income there's nothing wrong with a mortgage provided it's sustainable and isn't 30 years long.
