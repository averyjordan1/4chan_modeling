BTC will be x3 more profitable to mine than bcash in about two days.
Watch for the dump when miners switch.https://www.fork.lol/Hope you guys sold.- Merk
You are right, although BTC is safe at the moment, this could change overnight.
Carefully watch the hash-rate of both BTC and BCH network:https://fork.lol/pow/hashrateLook at relative hash distribution on 22&23 Augustus 2017, if that situation happens again, Bitcoin is most likely history.Bitcoin's protocol cannot adapt block difficulty fast enough if it's hash-rate drops too fast due to falling prices.
That's is probably one of the reasons they (current attackers?)
released BCH with the emergency difficulty adjustment.
The time-frame for a successful attack is approximately 3 days (till next difficulty adjustment for Bitcoin Cash).
If the majority of the miners decide to migrate to BCH for more profit (same SHA-256 hashing algorithm), then new blocks created on the BTC network will be generated extremely slowly or in the worst scenario, never again.
It's approximately 2 weeks from now when BTC network can adjust to a lower difficulty.
In short, if hash-rate drops too fast BTC transaction fees will rise to the mountain and confirmation time can take forever.
Panic selling will follow, and BTC value will drop to pre-2011 level, nearly zero.
Keep holding those bags, BTC shitcoiner
i dont think temporary fluctuations in hashrate are relevant since btc isnt used as a currency.
at this point noone cares anymore how fast it is.
at this point noone cares anymore how fast it isThis type of assumption is exactly why BCH is skyrocketing
If mining difficulty of BCH rises.
That just means its gaining miner adoption.
No?
