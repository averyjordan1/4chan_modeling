When I buy for example 0.1 BTC on GDAX and withdraw it to my own wallet, I receive exactly 0.1 BTC.
So who pays for the transaction fees from GDAX to my own wallet?
I can't imagine GDAX pays for all withdrawals out of their own pockets.
When I withdraw from Bittrex I always have to pay my own withdrawal fees so I don't understand.
