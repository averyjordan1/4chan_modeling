What is BlockMason Credit Protocol?- product use token- existing platform with a product out already- co-founder of ethereum on advisory position- just listed on binance- under 10m market cap- just found the bottom and has been bouncing off it last few hours
Buy walls looking good i might just throw money at this, can see a 30m market cap as btc does a u turn
Yeah ive been watching it for a few days looking to jump in
Hope this shit does something, cause it's fucking me badly
The best days are ahead, bitcoin run and start of the competition really hit the price but it is one of few coins with an actual product and customers and as the competition goes on more people will be hodling for the prizes and prices should increase to prevent others from hodling
