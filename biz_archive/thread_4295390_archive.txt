There's a new coin just added to Etherdelta (EPY)It has 15,375,000 total supply.It's around 10 cents (ICO price was 8 cents)Not on coinmarketcap yetProfessional team with Ph.D'sIt's pretty much common sense that once it gets added to CMC and people see a 15,375,000 supply at 10 cents, they are going to eat it the fuck up.Note: Yes it received a little bit of a P&D yesterday (from about 8 cents to 14, now it's back to 10-12), but that doesn't mean it isn't going to atleast 3-4x once it hits CMC.
emphy.io is their website if you want to verify anything I just said or do your own research.you're welcome

Its well worth it to learn how to use it to buy the coins before they hit major exchanges so you make way more profit.

Clif High called Veritaseum that went from a few dollars to over $200.
