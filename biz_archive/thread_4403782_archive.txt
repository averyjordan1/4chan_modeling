What's the most volatile alt I can buy right now with $200.
I wanna see upwards of 5% moves by the end of the week!
ALSO, it has to be available on Binance.
go to ED, buy ASTRO, next week it'll be on binance, sell on binance for 20x> not joking

not jokingHow difficult is it to make an account on ED?
Do I need to verify thoroughly or can I just ad an email address like I did on Binance and gogogo?
wtf ... You want me to buy high sell low?
It just mooned god dammit.
you don't need an account, its a website that serves up an open-source interface in your browser to a decentralized exchangeyou "log in" with an ether wallet then deposit ETH into it and trade away
right this second - LTC
Interesting.
I will look into this.
Can you provide me with a source that it will end up on Binance next week?
Or is this just a hype rumor?
I was in LTC last week lol and sold it as it got near the resistance around $65.
I will not be chasing these ATH's.
Most volatile alt right now is bch.
