Why won't it stop :( I've been fighting FOMO all day and listened to some of you people saying it's a shill coin and is gonna get dumped hard... people said it would be 1000 by the weekend.
and the pump is not stopping.
JUSTDo I buy in now or what
This all just means you're not cut out for trading so stop.
Go back to being a wagecuck.
Split your paycheck and put it into BTC, and HODL.
You do realise its just biztards shilling all this FUD.
Literally check anywhere and there is no mention of "muh dragonslayer".
Stay away from biz for the weekend if you cant handle the FuD and come back to all the pink wojacks after jihan verr dumps on their poor souls
Where the fuck have you been?
We've been making multiple threads practically screaming at you faggots to start accumulating but no instead you shitposted or ate up all the FUD from the bitter corecucks.
It's too late m8 you missed this moon mission AGAIN.
I guess there's always going to be a next time
There will be, old bagholders will finally be able to drop their bags and new bagholders are gonna be born at the same time.
We are all gonna make it one day
