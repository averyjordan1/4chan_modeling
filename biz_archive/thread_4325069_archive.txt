less than 10 minutes until the BCH adjustment and im using my low res crystal ball to guess there will be a large exit pump then a dump.
I think this will happen just after the adjustment
Why would the price pump or dump on some event everyone knows already ages ago.
miners squeezing profits to the last block
then switch to BTC
The miners will switch to BTC now for sure.
This does not affect the market price however any way.With the upcoming hardfork, BCH will be more profitable again at some point.
Then the miners will temporarily switch back to BCH again.
The price still doesn't care about it.
