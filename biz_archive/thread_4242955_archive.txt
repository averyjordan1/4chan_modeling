Is it a good or bad idea to transfer my stocks from Edward Jones to vanguard?
Right now I own a thousand shares of a stock with Edward Jones and I've had it for 10 years.
But I've heard there is big fees and I'm paying him to watch it or something like that?
Sounds shitty.
But he is a nice guy, how do you breakup with your financial advisor?
Is it the right thing to do?
I just want my stock over at vanguard.
sounds like you dont know much about finance which is ok. the fact you're questioning your EJ advisor and thinking Vanguard is a great first step.
I suggest you read a book or two by Jack Bogle or perhaps the Bogleheads book.
This will help you gain the knowledge you need and take full advantage of moving your assets.Your EJ advisor might be a nice guy but it doesn't mean you should be forking over a ton of fees for what mostly amounts to handholding.
This stuff isn't rocket science, most people can and should figure it out.Good luck
Bogle books are a good start for sureOP you should also figure out how much you're actually paying for fund expense ratios and advisor fees.
it's probably not good, but if your current fees are very low it might not be worth switching.
but since you don't know, you're probably paying more than you need to pay..
