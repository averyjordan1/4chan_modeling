U should have bought when I Shilled it at 53 cents, anon.
Not even on a decent exchange.
Yet.. Don’t miss it’s best cpl months.
Conservatively thinking it will go $4 by EOY.
E-Commerce security measure basically.
I think the software will be applicable to Shopify/eBay/etc I’m near future.
So it will have a product to pitch to big mainstream companies soon.
Only 9 mill supply, badass marketing/outreach team for a *decent* use-case.
Conclusion: still great short/mid term buy atm.
i wanted to buy, but i mainly trade at binance, sorry bro
>$4 by EOYmore end of weekthis shit's going to 500m cap by next year
Binance soon, so you'll get your chance at a higher price.
Why use Binance to buy, when you can use it to sell (high ofcourse).
shut yo bitch ass up
I shilled it before the ICO even started, and everyone said it was a scamcoin.
Now it's breaking 10m market cap and returning 25x gains (and that's after calculating the fact ETH is more expensive now than it was then).Could it still be one?
Perhaps, but that doesn't mean you guys could've not belittled me and made $20k in a week.
i will strike you down
