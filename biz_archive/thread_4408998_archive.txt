Solid wall at $7500.
Looks like the gooks have some competition this time.
LOL
this didn't age well, did it?
what is a wall?
It's something to keep us safe from the Korean yakuza Billy.
Is it true that a lot of Yakuza are crypto-Koreans?
good questionI dont think this is the correct answer?
It's not the first time they've been involved with tech.
I believe they threw a lot of money at a korean streaming website to launder money.
Also Korea's biggest industry is Samsung, so I'm sure they are involved with that somehow.
They have massive amounts of money to play with.
Last weeks pump and dump is apparently illegal in Korea, so their involvement is highly probable.
They probably thought they could get away with it since it's not a traditional exchange.
