https://www.hydrominer.orgThinking of investing into hydrominer.
I have done my due dilligence and am sure it is a legit project, see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9cxWnp30oBut not sure if this is going to be actually profitable.
On their website it states ~100% ROI if you use h20 tokens to mine other coins.
But as I understand this return is going to occur within a 2 year period, as the h20 tokens can be exchanged for "2 year mining contracts" whatever that means.
Also crypto can tank during the next 2 years making mining unprofitable.bonus: h20 tokens are going to be traded on COSS, so if you are a COSS holder this can create a jump price, like it happened with sumbstratum.Has anyone looked into hydrominer?
Whats your opinion?
Do you think the price can pump up right after hitting exchanges because of the uncertainty of what the ROI is actually going to be?
Or maybe dump in price right after ICO creating a good entry point?
