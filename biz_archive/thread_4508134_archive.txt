Hello, I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.
Today Bitcoin crossed $8300.
I'm really happy to see that.
Today I'm giving away a private key with access to 100 bitcoin to whoever thinks of the best insult for my arch rival, Fluffypony.
Post your insults here and I'll reward the best.
Thanks.
I fuck you mother!
!plz key
give it to me so I won't kill myself
Enjoy your ban m8
Fluff your pony if you want fluff
Mr.Nakamoto your plan is clearly flawed.
If you post the key here anyone can grab it
Why does fluffy hide his addresses?
Because he's insecure about his finances.
Fuck your mother if you want fuckBCH for4ever
ignore this.
It's perfectly safe to post the key here :^)
