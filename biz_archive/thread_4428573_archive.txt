bitcoin is not what is meant when people talk about blockchain technology"When Wall Street banks and big corporations like International Business Machines Corp. tout blockchain innovations, they’re usually cribbing technology from ethereum, not bitcoin’s blockchain."
- Bloomberg ( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-16/ether-derivatives-are-coming-from-a-pioneer-of-credit-swaps )The run on bitcoin at the moment is indeed comparable to tulip as it is not based on technological advancements.
