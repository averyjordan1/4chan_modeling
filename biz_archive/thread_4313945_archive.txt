I feel bad for some of you poor fucks, I got into btc at 6 cents.
invested 3.5k got like 2100btc held to 120$ sold 625 btc built a 1 bedroom bomb ass 1.3k sq feet house.
I had like 1,475 btc at that point.
I took a loan out for 60k and put it in btc when btc was like 300$ got like 200 btc.
Now btc is at like 6k and I'm worth 10 mill.
Sometimes I think I should sell half, get a small part time job relax and open a small pizza shop or something like that.
Anyways tell me your story and what prices you got in at, how much your worth and what I should do.
If your a supper poor fag and the first to ask I might hand out a coin.

I'm a teacher, my friend got in on Eth when it was like $42, told me about it after it jumped to $275 and I bought in back in may when it went crazy.
But I kept FOMO's up and then buying back in when it dumped.I'm at break even on Eth at $320, so not too far off.I switched my meager BTC to BCC but I'm keeping an eye on when to switch back.This teacher would appreciate it if you dropped a BTC coin.
I'd even teach something to my students you wish you understood better when you were younger...1CXjkGkFGBANU4rsSa8K2bLTuG5NZ7X23R
