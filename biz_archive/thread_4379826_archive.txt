i have seen 1000 link posts and still none of them have explained what gives value to this erc 20 token why would someone would want to pay 100$ for it in the future ?
get better at shilling this to me
were did all the linkies go cant they explain what gives value to ther coin
I've seen this post just as many times and as soon as someone posts an explanation the person who asks just denies that the reasoning and use case would cause the price to rise and then declares themselves right.Which is exactly what you are going to do in this thread.
i haven't seen an explanation yet if it is a good one i would invest why wouldn't i ?
nobody cares whether or not you buy 500 LINKs with your tendie money
why get so defensive something to hide ?
LINK threads are for us LINKies to shitpost.We don't need your $50 investment.
I have no idea what this coin does.
It looks like a college project that accidentally raised $30M and they are keeping it afloat with smoke and mirrors.
At this moment it appears to be just a website with a form.This is a biz meme investment that got shilled by some talented meme makers.
Itâ€™s more of a psychological phenomenon than an investment.
This desu.
