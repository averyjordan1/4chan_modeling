Dump this shit.
I got reqt one time and I'm so glad I dumped it with some gain this time.
set buy order at 767 sats and got filled, have 10k req, should of set it lower since it dumped pretty hard there
>dump it>while it's down>while this BCH/BTC thing will end eventually>when they have a product coming out next monthno
It's been down since ICO.
and?
the coin is only a month oldit hasn't done anything yet
JUSTTfw been bagholding since the ico
You can dump it and buy lower.
Because it will go lower.
I love these impatient pajeets.
getting so much cheap REQ from these idiots selling at a loss.
This coin can go down to 14k and I will still be in the green thanks to all the pajeets.
nothing will pump the price until the next product update 2 weeks away, sell now because it will bleed until then
eh, I don't feel like itI'm fine with what I have
This is the worst shitcoin right now
in what regard?
yes dump dump dump /biz/
this is a reason to hold, not dump you absolute imbecilethis biz logic>something is upBUY BUY BUY>something is downSELL SELL SELL
Comfiest hold.
You just know Request is going to be YUGEEEEE.
not even joking, threads like this are my buy signal.
Haha same here
majority of alts are dumping due to BTC drama>this pajeet choose to FUD REQ to buy in at a lower priceDamn you pajeets are slimy bastard aren't you lmao
yes terrible shitcoin sell everything you have goys
How much have you made with REQ so far?
Pure shitcoin confirmed
Not buying the dip is why dumb niggers like you stay poor
Thatâ€™s why theres so many pink wojaks.
could you tell me what site/program that is?
etherdelta
Sell, Pajeet, Sell!You will lose all your rupees and be cursed with nothing but daughters.
Literally dumped at 890 before I went to bed.

etherdelta is decentralized (and ebet only trades on there (at hitbtc))
