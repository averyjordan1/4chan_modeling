/co/ manchild here, what do I need to know if I’m bored of my life and just want to start day trading I’m not smart at all and can’t do math On the plus side I have a fast food job and sometimes sell comics on the side for possibly great profits, sometimes through convoluted schemes Here’s a useless example, I spent $24 on yugioh cards, then I sold them to a guy for $11 and a copy of the killing joke that I sold for $30I already got approved for a robinhood account, seems like it’s more of a holding app then day trading though
just remember, buy high sell low
