Get ITT Linkies.
Let's chat.
-Why are you so obsessed with this coin?
Is it because /biz/ fomo'd you into buying it and you want to damage control your decision?-Link does have strong fundamentals but does that really matter in crypto; a hype based market?-What's a realistic price it'll be by mid 2018?-If it fails what are you going to do?I'm not trying to FUD, I myself hold, though barely, like 21 LINK.
I'm just trying to address the elephant in the room.
If I get proper answers I'll accumulate more.
