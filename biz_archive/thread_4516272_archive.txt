You're welcome nerds
Wicked, I've been in since this morning :)
Clearly following me will lead to financial ruin...
XMR to 420
followed
what about on bittrex TA fag?
noooooooooooo
Use the xmr/usd pair bro.
retard alert
Youre gambling with more variables by trading btc/xmr.
You buy altcoins to accumulate btc.
They trade against btc, the USD pair is meaningless since the OTC volume is so low.
You clearly don't know what you're talking about, sorry.
you buy altcoins to accumulate btcNo I don't.
you are the fucking man ta fag!
I promised myself to hold my btc and not trade anymore.
but damn if it's not tempting to buy some monero here.
Well thanks for giving me your bitcoin retard!
I appreciate the donation, I'd spend it better than you anyways.Love you too anon
What is the easiest way to just buy Monero right now?
whoops ment for this anon, but love you both4516780bittrex, bitfinex, poloniex
xmr/fiat represents 50% of total monero volumeshut up dude
Which of the three would you recommend?I got screwed over by Gox and only just now getting back into this.
also OTC (over the counter) on localmonero.comsame thing as local bitcoins, rape tier prices but you get it instantly with cash.Sure buddy!
Whatever you say man!
Bitbay to 1200 sats
Polo or bittrex, or localmonero if you don't already have BTC and can pay with cash.
I don't know if i'd say buying at this current price would be the best bet, wait for it to find support at either .02 or .018 or a breakout of that handle in this chart.Hope this helps.>I love mt.gox, got all my long term holds there...
Listen buddy.
Ever since monero was listed on bithumb the koreans have been controlling the price.
They are the ones who took it from $50 to $150.Bithumb is the majority of the volume.
Bithumb trades monero against fiat.Just deal with it.
OH BALLS ITS STILL GOINGalso should i sell my litecoin for more monero?
yeah
trips of truth>who the fuk buys gold?
point to me on the menu where it says dick flavored popsicles.
