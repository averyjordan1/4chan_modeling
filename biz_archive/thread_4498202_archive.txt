So what is the best bitcoin wallet currently out there?I'm still new to all this, but is it preferred to use multiple wallets for regular use?

if you're just buying bitcoin and HODLing unironically just leave it on Coinbase
I have a main wallet and several other wallets for varying purposes.
Say I need a safe haven.
I can send to a premade wallet or create a fresh one on the spot to ensure no one has the PK.
Wouldn't recommend leaving coins on an exchange because they're not really your coins.
Unless you know the private key of the wallet storing them, they're not yours.May not be a bad idea for norms who will fully verify ID and all that.
Coinbase has the law & regulators breathing down their neck and (probably) wouldn't rob your coins.
Friend set me up with a Ethereum wallet and i've memorized the seed.How safe/unsafe are my coins left in there?
memorizedSorry for your loss.
Oh wow, thanks.
That will definitely help.
Kek, but seriously.
