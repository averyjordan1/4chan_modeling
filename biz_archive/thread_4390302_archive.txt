People say that there is no intrinsic value to cryptocurrency, what if I create one backed by porn?
I could have a depository, and every coin I release is backed by 1GB of porn.
You can turn in the coin at any time and you will get 1GB of porn.
Is there anything wrong with my plan?
Gold backed currency in the real world and porn can back currency in the crypto world.
$35 = 1 ounce of gold.
1 Porncoin = 1GB of porn.
Can this work?
>paying for pornThat's where you fucked up, OP.
Proof of Cum: block reward every time you nut
No.
I will torrent it.
I will sell coins for Bitcoin.
But every Porncoin is backed by porn and you can redeem it at any time.
bruv, perhaps you should try nofap for a while, maybe take a little break
I don't think he's talking about you
What do you mean intrinsic value?
If it has a use case, then it has intrinsic value.
A currency backed by X means jack shit if it doesn't actually have a function.
If it's Japanese porn I'll consider it.
I am on nofap.
Day 4.
The intrinsic value of the coin is an orgasm.
You get a GB of MILF porn.
What is the value of Bitcoin?
Can you even redeem it for anything?
But do you support child porn?
Asking for Money Skelly
Porn is bad for you, lookup NoFap / Porn addiction.
This is why you're an anxiety filled autist.
Thank me later.
How many terabytes would you need for this plan?
What if I'm into fucked up fetish porn?
what kind of porn?
this, javcoin
My coin is going to be backed by 100% MILF porn.
So Ava Devine, Sara Jay, Phoenix Marie, Brandi Love, Tiffany Mynx.
I already am on nofap.
Day 4.
My coin is backed by MILF porn only.
I would need several terabytes but after that it is smooth sailing.
Ava Devine is a MILF and has a ton of fetish porn.
Good luck getting the rights to that much porn / good luck with your lawsuit
