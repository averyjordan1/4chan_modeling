Awful list...
Pretty much screams "buy my bags PLEASE"
its like a japanese version of litecoin and is asic resistantI don't even have 50% of these listed coins, I don't have enough to hold all of them
Horizon State (HST).Real life usage, professional team and low market cap $9,3MM.Will be listed on 3 exchanges by the end of Nov.
Lots of reason but also lots of shilling so be carefull.
Mona is a:+ adjusted copy of litecoin (limited supply)+ can be bought directly with yen and krw+ has quick blocktimes+ asic resistance+ supportive JAPANESE community (ex: monappy)+ very, very limited adoption in a few stores in Japan (2 - 5 or something probably)+ Had an advertisement on a large screen in akihabara+ metal coins of MONA exist...It's not the Japanese bitcoin or some BS but its worth looking into
