Is there some kind of app that helps me consolidate news from cryptos that I am invested in?
Will show me news articles about it if they appear, their facebook and twitter posts, etc without needing to check each one manually?
only follow their twittersubscribe to their subredditswatch their threads in cryopto forums.
i'm not aware of any real way to conveniently consolidate everything into one single place - would be a nice project for someone though.It's one of the reasons I ended up selling off a lot of my shitcoins and just holding 2-3, it's too much work keeping up on all the info, and if the markets do shift quickly (like they did a month ago when BTC started mooning) it's difficult to liquidate if you're holding like 10 different coins spread across multiple exchanges.
