Let's say Alice wants to send Bob $100.
Bob offers instead that Alice give him a blowjob.
Alice is more than a little taken aback by such a request and slips a laxative in Bob's drink.
Bob begins to shit uncontrollably all over the living room.
Now earlier in the day, Bob was counting his spare change in the living room.
After he shat everywhere, the coins were covered in shit.
One coin caught his eye.
It seemed completely covered in shit, far more disgusting than any other coin.
He picked it up and said "I shall call you Bcash, for I have emptied my bowls all over you.
"Then this little greedy chinaman popped out from a nearby cupboard and shouted "IT'S BITCOIN CASH NOT BCASH OKAY?!?!"
Bob protested "What?
I know what Bitcoin is and this piece of shit is not Bitcoin.
Putting Bitcoin in the name is just going to confuse people."
The chinese goblin creature pondered this for a moment and then offered Bob a blowjob if he called it Bitcoin Cash.
Bob agreed and that is how Bitcoin Cash was born, or as it is known by non-cock-suckers, Bcash.
Hmmmmmmm, interesting
But how did they secure the transaction?
Did the chinese goblin creature have any verification of services rendered before he provided the blowjob?
He didn't because it was impossible until now.
Introducing blowjobcoin where every token is backed by blowjobs verified by multiple independent observers who are payed in blowjobcoins.
You can now set up contracts where blowjobs can be traded for work, all you need to do is provide 1-2 blowjobs a day as "gas".
