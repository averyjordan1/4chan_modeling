larping corecuck
Judging from your previous comments I can now conclude that only complete fucking retards are investing in BCH.
Good luck fucker.
4378369Jesus Christ.
If there's a significant portion of the trading population with your 'prowess', then I know exactly who I'm making a fortune exploiting.
cucks
Let me try and spell it out for you:Bitcoin Cash was a hostile fork intending to steal the wealth of bitcoin by targeting the miners.
Their business model was to try and cause "chain death" for BTC.Here's the reality-check... Bitcoin is now in a phase of institutionalisation.
Big banks like Goldman Sachs want BTC, the Russian government wants BTC, every big player wants BTC.Do you really think the big institutions are going to roll over and let some Chinese thieves steal all that wealth with a hostile fork?Not a fucking chance.
Big business is behind BTC, they want to own and control as much of it as they can.BCH may be a better system, but that doesn't mean the big institutions want to play ball.
This is fantastic bait.

Anon, you must be some kind of mathematical genius.
On top of that, do you think these big investors coming in from traditional markets give two shits about tech or about confirmation time or fees?
I highly doubt it seeing that they come from markets that are slow and expensive already.All that matters is % gained.
Even when all exchanges kicked it and the price is at $1 we will still hear "this is good for us, just wait!"
You're an absolute retard if you think its a good thing to have 1 little jewchink in complete control of what happens to your coins...
4378369Thank you.
It's people like you that make me feel like I can win in crypto.
If your just trolling, it's funny.
If you're serious, then I know that people like you are out there buying my bags.
U guys are so gullable.
Bitmex is essentially buying everyones bch cause they know its going to make a mega bull run in the future.
This is all psychology.
Screen cap this
The price of BCH on August 1 was $280.Bitmex is jewing their users out of their BCH.
even if hes trolling, there are absolutely people out there this stupid, or stupider.
just dont sell your bitcoin, youll be fine
Dont forget that coinbase will release their bch the 1st of january, which will make the price drop even more.
There is something really fishy about this.
They probably already dumped cash and are now trying to cover there ass.
Hahaha wtf dude.
yes very fishy.
it doesnt say what price the users are getting for their bch, how do we know he didnt already sell them at .4 already then give the users todays price?
or if he is just confiscating them himself at rock bottom price because he is bullish
4379539You know they didn't sell it yet because you can check your balance on the bch block explorer using your deposit address.
That's not actually your balance for most people because that's just your btc deposits, but you can see that It is still in the address, so there is no way they could have sold it yet...
BTC = Bilderberg Trash Coin Help Free The World - Sell It Nowdonâ€™t be left holding the bag
yeah, lets all sell our actual decentralized BTC for the hostile fork controlled by 1 chink.
