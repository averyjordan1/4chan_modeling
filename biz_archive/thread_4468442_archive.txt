Bluepaper coming in two days, one of the most ambitious crypto project (bitcoin decentralized monetary system, they are trying to decentralize entire economy and communication)> I was right about NEO (ANS from 1$).
> I was right about WTC.
> I was right about VTC.
> I was right about BCH > I am not wrong now.
Why IoP?
Coming soon:> Bluepaper in 2 days> Roadmap to follow soon> Official marketing campaing> New big exchanges> They already have beta messenger released (it provides better privacy then any out there, basically real what's up 2.0)> Partnership with Libertania> Amazing devs (they will do livestream where they will make what IOTA wants to make in just a couple of days)> Making separate exchange where coins (same as ICO) could be purchased with IOP> Hydra airdrop (for any IOP on the wallet you have a chance to get airdrop of hydra) and that is just the start> Low circulation (around 2m coins)> Just got out of stealth > low market cap of less then 5m$> Active community, there is always someone on telegram or discord and you can even have conversation with project developers and even project leader> FFS buy it or cry laterDon't trust me?
> DYOR> Check their price few months ago and the current price, it all happened because of a scammer who stole coins and dumped them all and hijacked the network.
They took all back and have worked on project non stop.
I expect the previous price to be met soon.> You have 24 hours before the pump starts, whales accumulating and bitcoin surge is keeping it down but not for long!
I repeat, this is not a test, we are going to the moon, buckle up!
If it wasn't for that fucking horrible picture I would trust you
 DYOR anon if you don't trust me, I am just another guy looking to make a lambo and go to the moon, IOP will get me there so why not have 3 in 1
