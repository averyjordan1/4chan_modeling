just wanna hear opinions
Trash imo
No one uses it or will ever use it.
When the devs donâ€™t see it as an investment, it has no profitable use for buyers
lol DNT got buried months ago
devs literally just got onto bittrex after a huge fuckaround where they appeared to be a security, of course they're going to pretend its not an investment and not a utility.
they have premine that they plan on making grow into a fortune, they just want the deniability of saying it wasnt supposed to be an investment if they dont make their nut
*pretend its not an investment and not a security, rather a utility.goofed my bad
their founder is based in the US which means they have to be autistically utility-oriented or the SEC will end their party quickdont be fooled, they're as greedy as all other devs and it'll pump all the same
I have 50K of these but can't for the life of me figure out how the token will increase in value.
What's positive for me is that they have VERY active developers working on a big project.
The project has very good design - and supposedly people will be able to use votes to generate profits from the districts.
How that will actually play out is anyone's guess, but the team seems really smart and dedicated to the project and I would think (despite what they say) that they want the token value to increase.
