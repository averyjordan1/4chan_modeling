How hard would it be to fake a team/project, do an ICO and disappear with the ETH ?I've good a really good idea but I'm too lazy to apply it.I could just ride the "low marketcap ICO" meme with a 1 million $ cap, collect it in a few hours and laugh all the way to binance.I'd move in a foreign country for all this time, do my website.io, the bitcointalk ann, the ICO, sell some more coins on ED, launder it while I'm there with fake transactions, move the ETH to exchanges and cash out slowly when at home.
>I've good a really good ideakek
why dont you make something that's not a scam?
