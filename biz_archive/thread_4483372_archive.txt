They're doing this again but this time with ETHBT instead of EBET.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2432970.0
You had this coming.What were you thinking hodling a shitcoin?
What do you mean can you explain what’s going on?
I hold EBET
Apparently they're doing another ICO but this time is called Etherbet instead of Ethbet.Look at the trades chart on https://etherdelta.com/#EBET-ETH.The price halved today and only a few buy orders separate EBET from the oblivion.It's dumping there too https://hitbtc.com/exchange/EBET-to-ETH.Some hours ago the order book got filled from 0.00001 to 0.00010 so it looks like there's people still wanting to buy it if the coin dips lower.But that's 3 ETH more max.You got fucked in the ass you're not going to see your ETH back.That's literally Confido 2.0.Sorry.
This is completely unrelated to EBET.
Do you even know what EBET is?
of course the price is dogshit.
The app isn’t even released.
What did you think you just buy icos and the price goes up automatically?
heh I wish LINK ICO didn't set me up to think that way.
been JUST'd on ENJ and EBET.
OP is dumb
Do you even know what EBET is?A scam coin.
OP is dumbNo, OP is right.There are opportunities right and left.Why would anyone hold this while they are cloning it?In a few months ETH will be $ 600.>No team.>No product.>Clone ICO.The absolute state of shit board.
