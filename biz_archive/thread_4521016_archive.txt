sold at 3.2 right before it moon
you can rebuy in the next dip, the real moon mission is in 2018
.7 or 3.6
i mean (you)
Hard to say bro, Might never dip , just buy in before we get on Bittrex :p
its not really mooning just going up slowly.
i was expecting big action after the pump 2 says ago but it levelled off at support.i think itll keep going sideways and slowly up
how it should be for good growth over time
