Can someone just give me a straight answer, is Monero anonymous or not?
And if so, why not?
Can someone actually get a physical location/IP address from an XMR transaction?
To my understanding, it's possible to see a list of IP addresses that are connected to the monero network, but it's impossible to link them to any specific transaction.

ok thank you, so everyone saying it isnt truly anonymous is FUDing.
By their logic have a list of post codes is equivalent to gps tracking.
It is without a doubt the most anonymous coin, and maybe even greater than that, it is literally the only fungible cryptocurrency
