At least I only put down 100 bucks into it when it was at 17

I hope it stays at that price until mid next year so all the ADHD day trader meme-coin chasing retards get shaken out.
I'm fucking watching charts on binance right now praying it gets to 1000 satoshi for a flash crash.
I'm literally going all in if that happens.
My exact move.
Not sure if seeing it on /biz/ is a good sign.
