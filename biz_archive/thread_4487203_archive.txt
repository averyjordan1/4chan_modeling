The quality of this board has really gone down a ton compared to 2 months ago.
Shills, bagholders trying to unload, inexpereienced traders trying to recommend their coins and burning others in the proccess also giving bad advice/recommendations, Pajeets, PnD groups flooding the board, larpers.
This is just resulting in people just losing more of their money if you can't find the gem through all this garbage.
yeah, it seems like there is more shit to wade through nowadays
