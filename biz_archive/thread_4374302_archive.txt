How does this compare vs. neo?
I hold neo but what's different?
Better than Neo and the whole company is as big as Neo.
I'd bet on Metaverse.
Yes but how is it better, more like, how are they different?
MetaVerse can be used by any business without any programmer knowledge, with neo they have to be able to program to use the neo blockchain.
That's pretty cool, but I don't think it'll help ETP much.
Bitfinex has the majority of volume and hitBTC listing stole only 1% of that.
The more exchanges listing it more exposure it gets.
This coin is under the radar for most people.
It's volume is all Bitfinex and Bitfinex volume is mostly just Bitcoin.
