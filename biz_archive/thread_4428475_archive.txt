How long will Ether be stuck at $330?
it'll drop to $290 by next week, dont worry
Remember when it was stuck at 300?So about 2 months.
I hope so, may i ask why do you think it will drop and maybe when?
Thanks in advance
ETH will be struggling around $100 probably middle of 2018.The fanboys will keep it alive at this point but serious money will stay out of it.
Because either BTC or BCH will make a big move upwards or downwards and the rest of the market is gonna tank like always
you are completely retarded if you haven't noticed it's actually companies that are starting to build etherium apps lol.
Thanks
they are just forking itthey don't care about network you use
