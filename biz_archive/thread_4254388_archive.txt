I just invested.
Am I too late or will it go to the moon?
Late my dude
Nah, you're not late but get in now before you are.
$33 is not that high for NEO.
Long term strategy: China is gonna be putting in regulations over time and eventually making crypto currencies legal again.
Once that happens.
Massive boom to $400 at least.short term: buy now, wait for the giant market of china to realize what has happen (most are sleeping right now) and by 5-6pm MST NEO is going to boom.
BTC will drop much more.tip?NEO:AYreHhstyxGGQXiZYtgPqgwBGaSeEg47uX
NEO WILL reach parity with ETH in 2018. it just needs a little more development time.
NEO today over 550 k, do you agree?
Absolutely.
I think in about 3 Hrs
