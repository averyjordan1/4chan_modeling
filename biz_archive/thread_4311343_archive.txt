so if BCH takes over alts are all dead right?forks killed this entire market
yes, its going to make altcoins obsolete
Wait is this true?Don't meme me I have everything in alts
im scared
exchanges would be fucked for a while but alts will never dieeth will likely moon and go to #1
A ton of alts trade in bitcoin.
so when will alts start rebounding?do we have to wait for BCH to surpass BTC?
Wouldn't bch just be renamed btc and that's all that would need to happen?
bch is a chink pump and dump , no way something can moon like this without some shady chink shit
No way, you've to set a new BCC-ALTS market.Anyway it's not going to fucking happens.
wait for BCH to surpass BTClol not going to happenalts will rebound when btc stabilizes
Jihan wants it to be called BCH.
That is reason alone to not believe in a flippening
Irrelevant.
All that means is that he doesn't think BCH assuming the name "Bitcoin" is very important.
As long as his coin comes out on top he'll be satisfied.
No way, you've to set a new BCC-ALTS market.This is exactly what would happen lmao
it already has the name bitcoin in it thats why its worth anything at all
