You are blissfully forgetting the 18month bear market after mtgox that brought the price down 80%.
There's a good chance something like that happens again with all of the tether, bitconnect, forking, mining and failing to scale problems going on.
I can almost guarantee that BTC doesn't keep going parabolic to 1million.
go up 3000%, drop 80%, go up 3000%, drop 80%, go up 3000%, drop 80%im pretty sure that works out just fine.
You are really fucking stupid.
...................../biz/ in a nutshell

the landscape has changed since then.
oh wow
At this point I don't even have the money to get in anymore, and I want a full bitcoin not a bunch of sats.
Not some other BS denotation either, A FULL BITCOIN

Even if we bought it at $0.01, I doubt most of us are going hold BTC so for many years.
Trade up shitcoins then fagit.
I started with $300 in March and have over 2 Bitcoins right now, and I'm really not even that great at it
Nice one, which shitcoins got you there?
Bitcoin owners are so damn autistic that they won't sell it even after making millions.There are guys out there who own thousands of BTC and they ride a bicycle to work and live with their parents.I'd rather give control of BTC to banksters than these freaks.
Why would you sell?
>the year is 2055 You think I'm still alive in '55?Damn this board is full of youngsters
you can hold some and sell some
how about 2025 then?
What's the use of being a millionaire if you're living like a street rat?Money was made to be used.
The best two uses of money are:>to make your life better>to make more money so you can continue to make your life betterBTC autists only focus on making more money.Banksters know you need to buy castles, ferraris and shit.
Banksters deserve to control BTC.
he forgot the part where the Oracle network validates every step of his day
I just got a few thounsand â‚¬ more, is it too late to buy now, or should i wait for another dip below 8000
it's in part ii
oh I guess it doesn't actually say anything about LINK after all.
For some reason I thought it did.
but I haven't written part ii yet
Im waiting for the tether crash to get in
No anon, the only use for money is to make more money.
You don't understand capitalism at all
If there is no visible evidence of your wealth, you're technically poor.I buy expensive clothing, cars and bigger apartments than I can afford - and it's worth it.
Oh I am laffing so bad.
I found a real one!
