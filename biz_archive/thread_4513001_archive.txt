Wtf is going on with QTUM?There are lots of new coins that QTUM tokens.Energo, INK and Bodhi,Think there will even be a fucking Halal Food coin of some sort.
You mean ICOs on the QTUM platform?
Patience kimosabi.. this will moon once idiots realize how massive this blockchain will become.
It will be ETH and QTUM.
QTUM will be about half the cap of ETH soon
and NEO if it become legal in china
I'd buy in if I was y'all while it's still sitting at ~15
