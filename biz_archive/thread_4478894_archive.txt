It was a joke, like Ether being stuck at $300 for a month.
4479613sorry i was just pretending to be retarded :^) got u
dang nice one anonanyway back to thread guys can someone explain the purpose of modum tokens??
im interested but dont get why they have intrinsic value
It's the closest a token comes to being a "share" in the investing sense.
Their use is that you own part of the company in owning a token - they have no actual "utility" use.
Owning these tokens pays dividends in the form of Ethereum, and I believe you also get voting rights.
