Every heard of Refereum ?
If yes what do you think of it.
I like, but not enough people know of it.
Good start, but may take a few years to get everyone on board.
If youre in it for the long haul, buy on ED at a cheaper price once the hype settles.
If youre looking to flip, cash out at 1.5x - 3x.
FYI, I've been using Twitch since 2014 and it was only until recently in 2017 I've seen more exposure to people donating in bitcoin.
Similar to this, the adoption will take some time...
Right now its in a "Referal" Phase.
Im trying to get more ppl into it.
