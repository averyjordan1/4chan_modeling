The true king of all shitcoins?
you must be fool not to hoard xmr.
I am serious.
Bought 10 Monero 2 days ago before the bcash pump and dump.
Will I make it?
This isn't a shitcoin.
Ok I am all in now
Zcash is a shitcoin, Monero is the best anonymous payment coin avail
Not a shitcoin.
It's the only coin that is not a gimmick.

FEDS ARE FUCKING TERRIFIED OF MONERO>and an unknown amount of Monero
buy aeon for bigger gains
So what buy up now n sit on it?
Basically, yes.
buy aeon for bigger gainsaeon is just a testbed for moneromonero is better for long term hold
Monero isn't a shitcoin though.
Bitcoin wouldn't even be a thing if Monero had been out sooner.
Yes, I'm exhausted from the last week watching graphs and now I'd rather sit comfortably in Monero, than risk all my BCH gains.
Monero is more of a bitcoin than bitcoin itself, and this has never been forked.
I have 21 monero in my wallet, comfy
And as a miner, I love cryptonight.
Cards run very cool, less than 50C.
I heard it has to do with the memory use (L3).Basically a very well made algo with very good properties.
