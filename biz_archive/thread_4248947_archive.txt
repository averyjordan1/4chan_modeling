Started following /biz/ a few days ago, never been here before that.
What's the deal with 90% of Anons here holding Chain Link?
Serious question, no trolling.
Haven't heard about this coin anywhere else before I came to /biz/ and it the whole frontpage here is Chain Link spam.
So, how did this all start?
When?
Who persuaded everyone on buying it?
Because we're going to be rich, anon.
solves the oracle problemthats where it started, it got shilled so much and what do you think happens when something gets shilled past breaking point on 4chan?
Still doesn't answer my question.
What started this "revolution" that everyone here is holding Link?Like, did Jesus appear one day and say "go buy this coin!"
?I don't get it because it's pretty unknown outside of /biz/.
It was about a month ago, all anons taking a shit suddenly heard a sound coming from down below in the bowl: "buy chainlink, anon.
It solves the oracle problem, anon."
It was Sergey himself.
Since that moment we haven't heard anything from him.
there are claims he appeared at devcon, but we believe this was a fat imposter.
All of 4chan now spends most of their time on the toilet, awaiting the next coming of Sergey of Nazareth.
did Jesus appear one day and say "go buy this coin!"
?
yes, he did
 it's pretty unknown outside of /biz/.according to fucking whom?
