shit coins with the most moon potential on Etherdelta rn?
CFD will at least 2x within a week, if not more.
HST claims to be going on two exchanges over the next few days, won't be selling short of 4x
NEO GOLD
pretty much
ASTRO = Astronaut Capital investment token.
Low market cap, solid team and prospects for significant capital gains and quarterly ETH dividends.
They're just completing their token burn, so no listings on major exchanges yet.
The little bit of trading in ED so far has been in the 1.5x-3x ICO range, but currently pretty subdued.
Easily 5x after first dividend at the end of December.https://etherdelta.com/#0x7b22938ca841aa392c93dbb7f4c42178e3d65e88-ETH
IBTC for 10x potential
DRP obviously.
Get in now for a guaranteed 5x within a month.

Confido
4331531HST still have room to run you think?
Comfydo
comfydo and also hst horizon looking pumpish.

Absolutely.
Other exchange listings imminent, only just been put on CMC, massive coinburn (350million out of 400mil total) upcoming.
confido has to be the best pump candidate no?
i bought some an hour ago
eARK and its not even close
Anyone else think Autonio still has room to grow?
I feel that at this market cap it can still double
Will CFD drop down tonight like it did last night?
And then it moons again!
Pushing further than the day before.
Confido is a good buy for now.
HST is promising, but it's a bit too late if you want to jump now.
Another option is EPY.
This, buy EBCC for fuck sake, its market cap is less than $30,000 right now
Neo Gold is also starting to pump.
Anybody else just staring at these Autonio buys?
