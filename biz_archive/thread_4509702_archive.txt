Buy the next IOTA before it hits bittrex
LOL....just buy IOTA
shhhhh anon, let me accumulate more
Not yet.
IOTA is gonna come tumbling down.
Wait a week or so and then buy up IOT
I agree it is due for a pullback but the Devs are having an AMA on the 30th and are supposed to reveal a few things....so price going up before going down.
$1 will be the floor in December.
Reminder to do the opposite of what biz says.
That made me win literally thousands of dollars.
Fuck you shills and bagholders.
If you actually did some research on the project you'd realize it's massively undervalued.
In fact, i have a couple of raiblocks.
I just hate pajeet shills and bagholders shills.
(and myself for falling for their scams once in while)
but biz is literally only about buying something, how do you make money by not buying anything?
Counter signal.
You buy it before , and if you see it on biz, sell.
I don't know.
As long as you are a savvy and adequately cautious player, /biz/ can make you make money.Just going along with /biz/ consensus has made me $30K over the past year.
well that didnt work for me.
The "flavor of the month" coin has being pretty disastrous from what ive seen.
Can you please tell me in which coins that biz told you to buy, you have actually made money by holding for at least a month or so?
Or do you just join the P&Ds?
- Confido (I sold right before peak)- BCH- Monero (my greatest gains)- LiskAll by following /biz/ hype.
I'll admit I got lucky by both buying and selling at the right time, but hey it's paid for the next few months of NEETing so Im not at all mad.
well, good for you, but that sounds more like good luck than anything since so many other projects hyped by biz project failed in that time.
Do you still buy coins based on biz hype?
Do you have any right now?
HST and POWR have made me a lot money in the past week.
that's pretty good.
Did you buy them because of biz?
when?
