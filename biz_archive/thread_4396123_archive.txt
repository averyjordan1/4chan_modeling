EOY price predictions?
3 years time?
share your thoughts pajeets
eoy 30-603 years?
don't know if it will stay relevant but in 2018 q4 probably 100+
looking at their github, they seem to have a lot more activity than most altshttps://youtu.be/2RWegc0DWmQwill Gas grow higher than NEO?
All top 10 coins are literally dead until btc stops breaking ath every other week.
You might have noticed that neo, eth, monero and other princes did well during the fork drama, but are bleeding in the gutter again now that the king is back in business.Neo is a top contender for the crown but will not really shine until the king is dead, and that day may never come
I think Eth and Xmr are doing pretty well right now
eoy 40$3 years: 200$ - 400$
I'm not close to being in this mindset now , but you have to look at what happens if NEO has better ICOs than ETH.
I'd say this as important than even the China Govt crap.
If BCH can blow up because the fear is that China will adopt it > BTC ... then obviously there could be the same issue with NEO surpassing ETH?
They're both under half their satoshi ath, which means holding btc would have been way more profitable.
But sure, they're not dead in usd value, which is something i guess
The ICO boom is over because people can no longer make ez money by flipping them.I can't see NEO getting as big as ETH at this point.
Alt market is truly saturated, and 2018 is going to be the year where the alts that actually deliver on more than just hype will moon.
you are not up to date eh?
neo 100 eoy seems a lil low seeing all the news, upcoming events and icos..
let's be real the only thing that matters right now is USD.
Try explaining what a satoshi is to any serious trader or a normie you'll come off hella autistic.
I respect the vision at the end of the day
