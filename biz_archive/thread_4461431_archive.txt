Why should I buy LINK?Started researching it today due to all the hype here...
Don't, its a shitcoin, go buy NEO or something
The only thing you need to know is: it solves the oracle problem.
I had the same question as you, and posted a thread on here as well.
Anon told me that it solved the oracle problem,and that changed everything.
I look at life differently now, and I am in a much more positive mood nowadays.
We are all going to make it.
LINK is a game changer.
that's a scary pic
Long term stuff, buy and forget till 2019/20
what is the oracle problem?it actually looks useful and you can go to their website and take info from other sites and put into the ETH blockchain or make a bitcoin smartcontract.
no you can't, its a glorified JSON parser some fat cunt wrote in a toilet stall while interning at a hotdog stand at sibos.
Some virgins invested their allowances on it and here we are.
It gives +30% stamina and the ability to live rent free on fudders head.
They've been shilling this all year.
You're probably too late and gonna get dumped on.
Does it matter what the oracle problem is?
LINK solves it, who cares.
We'll be rich.
These are just the training weights
still gonna dump more?
uh oh...how you find out about this project?
the snowball effect is starting.
heard it here for the first time.
then went to the website and tried it, doesn't seem that that.
*that bad
Possible.
Volume is shit, moving average in downtrend.
Can't see anything that would indicate a reversal.
Maybe forming a double bottom but i would be cautious.
Don't throw money on it that you can't afford to lose.
All year?
the fuck
