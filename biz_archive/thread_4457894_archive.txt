lol it's in the pump stage for sure, I mean if this even happens, visa will take the biggest slice of fees if anyone uses it, youd get the conversion rate for your currency at visas "spot rate" which sufferes significant slippage compared to exchange prices, and it gives big brother an excellent window into your crypto and another way to tax it
