> get rich as a wagecuckthat's not how it works.
only way to get really rich is to have a business(es), scale them, and have wagecucks work for you.

You won't.
Wealth is the reward for creating something of value, or luck.
If you're buying crypto, stocks or anything else with hopes of getting rich, you are just gambling and will ultimately lose.
