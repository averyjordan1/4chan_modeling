you can buy stuff with 1000 dollars and can loan 99000 dollars to put into a trade.
While the trade is open you pay some intrest on the 99000 but you usally dont have these kinds of trades open for too long so its negligible.If the price drops by 1% though you would be down from 100k to 99k and the trade will liquidate since you only got 1k to begin with and you are down 1k.

Did anyone screencap that guy yesterday who put 17k into BCC and was so smug when he was up 7500 but then BCC crashed a few minutes later and he got wiped out?
