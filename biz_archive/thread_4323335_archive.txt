I'm starting to get the feeling that, regardless of what happens, Roger is turning Bitcoin into MySpace.
This could have a great run for 2-3 more years.
But he sort of has this reputation as a Los Angeles douche making constant power moves that go against the flow of the community.
My Prediction is This : Roger is going to realize this or has realized this.
And he might start making huge buys of rival/competitor coins to save face atm.
He doesn't want their to be a mutiny against BCH from the other players in the Alt community.
^^^ I'm more than happy with the amount of money I made from BCH this week but overall I feel like the state of crypto is taking hazardous steps back.
For him to be King of the "King Coin" he has to make sure that other markets don't collapse upon his erratic behavior.
The guy went to Prison.
He knows that he just did something shady.
He knows gang mentality.
Now he needs to use his gains to make sure he doesn't get ruined.
cope harder core shill>that go against the flow of the communityYou mean that go against the flow of Theymos and his censorship..His "prison time" was for selling bird scaring fireworks.
A corecuck would of course care about being anti-government
speaking of myspace, did anyone notice how nobody really uses it anymore, most people jumped ship to facecuck i think....seems like most of my friends on there haven't logged in for ages.

The last part was a joke.
I get that you haven't heard many of those because you lived in a single parent household , but they exist.

I said I made profit off of BCH.
I only really give a fuck about profit.

We've seen this movie a million times in Tech and Wall St.
I work in FinTech w/ social media so I've seen both.
When a major figurehead does something erratic - they have to worry about the public looking for the "next option".
The Overton Window of the Crypto Community can change.
And Roger has to be smart and try to make the right moves so it changes with him instead of against.
