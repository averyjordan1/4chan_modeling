AIR is flying under the radar on EDLow marketcap of 5mTop teamWorking product - go download Airfox Browser from Google Play storeEstablished business, they made 600k USD in the past year.Strict KYC - you had to sign a contract to enter their ICONew Alpha product with blockchain integration coming next month2 exchanges coming next monthIt is about 60% below ICO price but it'll moon for sure.
Easy 5x, maybe 10x.I'm done by accumulating, now fill your bags.
would love to at least be able to unload my bags, hope your mouth is golder :D it's been said seeing it bleed this much :/
It is about 60% below ICO price rofl i thought my airswap bags were heavy
Still holding my Ico bags.
Tried to unload my bags twice but with this volume it's not going to happen.Is the team still following the nazi route?
AirToken telegram ist the neue deutsche reich.
It's bottomed due to lack of hype and Ian Balina telling his followers to dump.Just needs an exchange listing, and we've been told 2 are coming.
It's bad for ICO buyers, but buying at this price surely means gains.Im not in the Telegram channel, it's too negative as everyone just talks about price and exchanges, rather than the product.
Got in on ICO, eventually sold off my bag at 50% loss to chase quicker gains on other tokens.
I think the project has potential and the team - at least in terms of credentials - is fucking stellar but we're quite a bit off a moon mission on this IMO.
But still it probably won't go much cheaper so might be worth buying some up now - especially if you start seeing it shilled more often here and elsewhere which would point to imminent PnD.
Ah hey.
Only 60% down so far, this has to moon eventually, right!?
It better do or I'm going to neck myself
