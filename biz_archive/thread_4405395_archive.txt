Goys I want to talk about NEO.
Since it already mooned this isn't going to move much on shilling so please don't do that, and honestly it probably sits around where it should at a fraction of the world ETH.
We have it's high capped friends to see that this range doesn't get too much action, it's all priced in and any good news was a pretty much a given.
So what are the circumstances that could result in a supermoon event, ETH had the EEA.Right now China is a hostile environment for our scams, ICOs are banned and bitcoin is being targeted.
Xi doesn't take any fucking shit, he is invulnerable to our memes.
But China is also a FOMO leader, floodgates would be huge, what opens them for this coin?I've played day trader all year and I'm tired of being in this gutter, the golden age is well and truly ogre so there's no point in stooping to these scumbag levels, it isn't worth the cost of self respect.
I am going to spend the rest of the year identifying real chances to place my bets and leave them alone so I can refocus on traditional pursuits in case our pyramid collapses.If there are still non pajeets here I will share my analysis with the good people of /biz, this thread is to gauge the pajeet level and see if we can still be objective here, if we can't I will perform these works by myself because honestly the pajeets declared war so I want them to stay poor
oh god please i want NEO to be like ETH.
it would make me very happy
well that doesn't get anyone anywhere, i want to identify what would.
for example china giving special treatment to chink platforms as they do with everything else, but is this going to outweigh their monster capital flight elephant?
can it ever happen or would it take something like NEM going first, they sure as shit arn't going to let the japs get one up on them
