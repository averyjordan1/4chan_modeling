Waiting for that FUDder to post his copypasta
Silk Road worked because it was a drug hub that gave the addicts some moral justification for their degeneracy.
"We want to disarm the American industrial military prison complex, coercion through violence must be abolished, we don't hurt anyone", and so on.BitBay is a drug-less platform and their ideology can be summed up by: "rolling peg!
rolling peg!
rolling peg!"
>mfw some of you think markets are only useful for drugs and illegal shitFOMO gonna get you bad soon
Have you ever heard of the economy of scale concept, or of that company called Amazon?No homebrew cryptocurrency project is going to dislodge billion dollar actors in this space.
Consumer goods markets are already incredibly efficient.But who am I kidding.
Bagholders got to rationalize their mistakes, I guess.
I think bitbay is more for particular to particular, like ebay or craigslist than amazon.
Lol come February, SYSCOIN will shit on every "decentralised" market.
