So flippening aside, does BTH have a chance to ride BTC'S momentum as not necessarily a competitor but a similar IP with its own positives?
Gave up a 12k gain when exodus wouldn't let me exchange my BTH for anything during ATH.
Overall I wouldn't take a loss but id like to know if I'm in for any comfy gains
