Hey guys just got Blockfolio.
My familyâ€™s plan has unlimited data, is it better to mine on WiFi or celular data?
Thanks
Don't mine, just buy 100k of blockfolio coins and make masternode.
I also stack BLFO, the 25% annual gains are totally worth it.
Just type in the coins that you want and Blockfolio will magically give them to you.
Name your own wealth!
If you can connect WiFi to Cellular in a CJL (Closed Joost Loop) you can mine at up to 4x.
Ok thanks and when I want to cash out how to I export my private key to coinbase?
