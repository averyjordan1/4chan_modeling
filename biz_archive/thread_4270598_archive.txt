Bitcoin Cash Set To Undergo Hard Fork
You do realise every coin except Bitcoin undergoes hard forks all the timeIt's only Bitcoin that shits itself
It's cuz every other coin is a literal dictatorship.
Whatever the dev says goes.
No place for the community's difference of opinion.
They don't give a shit.
That's why Bcash has a cult that berates everyone who don't agree with their great leaders instead of an actual community.
u saying wat u son of basterd bich?
expecting a minority chain to not undergo HFs to maintain proper difficulties There is still consensus, it isn't like ETH in which one person or organization can just call for a HF.Bcash will probably HF again.
Once it reaches Segwit's hashing power (or even a little less), it'll be the safest chain on the market.
No fork can outperform bitcoinCult of Judas
Bch is already dead, it doesn't know it yet
No senpai, Segwit is already dead.
The body is just beginning to decay.
Not a hard fork.
hard forkMore like hard fuck, amirite?
