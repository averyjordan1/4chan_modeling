Okay anons, I'm back.
30 million more fake tethers being created for Bitfinex.
The real question, the question that will make us a ton of money, do they use it to pump BCH due to the segwit2x panic fork OR do they simply push BTC to 9k today??
God I wish i knew...

I want non to sit on me
Yep, here it comes - get ready for a big green candle pushing the price up to 8-9k if they put it towards BTC.
Which one do you think it is, bitfinexed anon-chan?
ALL IN BTC, HEDGE WITH BCH NO STOP LOSS.

assuming the the tether - bitcoin conspiracy is true can you work out what it should pump to?
its obvious, superimpose the charts of tether issues and BTC moons over the past few months and you see the corellation.
8500 and drop to 8000 support by fake tethers.
God bless the finexjew
set aside carefully calculated amount of funds for BTC>use all of said funds to buy BTC>I'm all in guys>set aside carefully calculated amount of funds for utility bills>use all of said funds for utility bills >I'm all in guys This is you right now
gay pajeet
I was right, they're using this to launch BCH again.
Good luck out there anons!
BCH is being pumped instead?
Maybe this is a sign?
its habbening
2x forked 10 minutes ago
Fuck me, now it's just sitting there at 7800.
Like, I've no clue wtf they're gonna do, but they didn't print another 30 million tethers to wipe their asses with.
Anyone with any financial law knowledge know how legal this tether stuff is for bitfinex?
Could they get shut down by authorities over this?
Maybe because of segwit2x check?
What do you have against central banking and fiat crypto?
ICOnot even once.
