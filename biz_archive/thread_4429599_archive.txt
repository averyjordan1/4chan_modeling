I don't usually shit post this coin but has it finally hit the floor?
Can I buy this and actually expect returns now?
The floor is 10 cents.
Just wait.
THIS IS GOING TO PUMP AND PEOPLE WILL FOMO HARDER THAN WITH NEO SCREENCAP THIS AND REMEMBER YOU WERE WARNED FAGGOT
as long bitcoin keeps pumping theres no floor only death

just buy it.
once you own LINK you don't care about $ anymorestop living rent free in our heads.
Become a Linkie
My TA says 8 cents
This coin is above ico.
Not sure what Linkirs are crying about.
You got REQ fags who price was never ever above ico except for a minute.
Itâ€™s like being born retarded.
