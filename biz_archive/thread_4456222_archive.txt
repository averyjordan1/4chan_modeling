Can someone explain why some banks are trying to leave Catalonia.
I understand Catalonia wants to separate from Spain, but I still don't know why the banks wanna leave.
Looking for economic reasons like why shareholders wouldn't like them staying or something.
banks work with the government
banks not "leaving" just moving the center bank.
And ill tell you the truth: Because govt and the spanish "KING" are forcing them
Catalonia's official money will be a crypto.
Screenshot this
so why would the king/govt force them to do that
