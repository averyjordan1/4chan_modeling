What do you think has best chance of being the next coin listed on GDAX?
Ethereum tokens.
Founders are balls deep in Ether and CB just released Toshi which is an ethereum mobile wallet.
I wish it would be VTC or XMR but I doubt it
if it's neo im gonna be pissed
Omisego (OMG) or perhaps Tokens and Alts with BTC and ETH pairs?
This would facilitate keeping the BCH withdrawals inside their ecosystem so they can make money on trading fees.
