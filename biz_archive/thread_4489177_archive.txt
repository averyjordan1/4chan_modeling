Dash might be slightly suboptimal tech, but it's still 100 times better that bitcoin.
And they are doing real-world application the right way.
Really professional.

Weed is the whole reason I missed buying into Bitcoin like 4 years ago.
I was way too lazy to look up how to do it.

Dash should be worth more than bitcoin cash.
