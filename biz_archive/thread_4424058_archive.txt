Let's hear your arguments

Bitcoin is not that cool.
First of all as a payment method it's garbage.
High fees, not anonymous, insanely slow tx times, network can be held hostage, highly dependent on China.
So we throw out the payment use case for it, and people are left with "muh store of value."
Right, because great stores of value are ridiculously volatile and based solely on speculation and computing power.
If you choose to store a large percentage of your net worth in bitcoin, you are betting that for whatever reason people will continue to value the bitcoin network and mine bitcoin.
If people ever wake up and realize that there's no real value being added to the world by mining, holding, or transacting with bitcoins, they will stop paying for them and then miners will eventually stop mining if no one is paying for them.
Basically it is all speculation right now.
People will argue gold is no different, but gold is tangible and can be used for things other than a store of value.
Whatever though I'm not even trying to debate whether or not gold is a good store of value, but bitcoin isn't.
Ethereum makes me nervous and i can't explain why.
It's not the foot in mouth syndrome of the main guy running it, i don't care about that.
More like it seems like it won't catch on in the long term.
This is 100% gut feel though.
There is no specific thing i can point to and say here, this bit of information here, is why eth might be a dud.
