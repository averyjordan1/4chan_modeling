Any of you faggots set up a ChainLink node on the testnet?Just set one up now while drinking some ale before bed.Feels so comfy.
How difficult is it to operate a node?
I read a meme that its useless to operate a node without having any useful information.
Congrats on wasting your time, running a node literally has no use right now.
Its just gonna repeat the same colored text over and over.trust me, I did this like 2 weeks ago.
That guy was wrong see
