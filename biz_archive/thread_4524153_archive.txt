>BTC>ETH>DASH>LTC>XMRWhy do you need any other coins?
Sell DASH if this is a long term portfolio and you're good.
dash is kinda unnecessary if you have xmr

Because other coins go up 50% all the time and not 25% every three months.
That being said I plan to hold BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR and ETP long term after I make some gains off shitcoins.
BTC>DASH>XMR>BadLTC>BadXMR>BadZCash
biz iz basically just a day trading pnd crypto group, that also happens to be really bad at itwhy dash long term?
I have XRP instead of Dash
Have some XRP incase jews try and take over with it.
And get ARK to save you when the Jews ultimately fail and collapse the Crypto market.
