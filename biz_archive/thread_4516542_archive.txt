A lot of people asking for advice on what to invest in and I figured this would be easier than retyping everything each time I respond to somebody.DOGE is doing one of its seasonal pumps.
If you head to coinmarketcap you can see that they have around twice a year and usually get close to the ATH or occasionally pass it.hitting 21 was what made people start buying in as that signaled the uptrend.
As of typing this its at 23 sats, but if you can get in before 25 sats, thats great.Should go at least to 85, Probably  and if everything goes amazingly, we might even break the ATH.Check the history out for yourself, dont invest in this because somebody on 4chan said so alone.
Best of luck, /biz/bros
