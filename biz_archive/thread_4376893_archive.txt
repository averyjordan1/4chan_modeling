I have .05 in about 15-20 different altcoins in addition to my bigger BTC and Top 20 positions.I've noticed that since I did this the altcoin dumps affect me way less because at least two coins end up mooning anyway and offsetting the losses, and then when alts boom again I gain BTC like crazy.Is being diluted a good way to make it, biz?
all in or nothin
Last time I all inned was on MCO and I got thoroughly JUSTed.
Never again.
MCO cucked me into oblivion, 40% loss
All in on REQ right now and getting hardcore JUSTed.
You are too late with your advice
Wiped out my ANS/NEO gains.
I'm almost over it.
Same.
I was at $20k when I went into MCO, $10k now.
Never again
It's less risk, certainly.
You are betting on the market growing as a whole.Currently 50% spread out over 8 alts mostly supportive of eth, plus a good amount in eth itself and a few random bags.
Biggest winner this week, fucking chancoin.
Fml.
