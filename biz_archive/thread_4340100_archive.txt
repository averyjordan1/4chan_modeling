1) If Segwit2x wasn't cancelled, what was to be the fate of BCH?
2) What would have been the difference between Segwit2x and BCH?3 What's stopping BTC to suddenly announce resuming of Segwit2x as planned?4) What would have been the fate of BTC legacy should Segwit2x went on as planned?
All you need to know is that the miners are sick of Blockstream's bullshit, and soon the market will be too.
You have 5 hours left to buy BCH.
If segwit 2x was really conttentious, one could have justified a BCH really like we saw earlier.
The fact that it rallied after the Segwit 2x was called of is clear signal that this was all planned.
This is not even really a consiperayc since Jihan wu was actually one of the main people who called off segwit2x.
If segwit 2x really happened, it would have died off anyway.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
Segwit 2x is still happening but it will be a lot more like Bitcoin Gold so no one cares anymore.
Alts are where it's at.
