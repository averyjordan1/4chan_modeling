Is this big news or meh?
big if news
It is big news.
Everybody thought the project is dead, but now they are releasing the App and Card.
Easy 3x from here as the price is on the Bottom.
So, they're just releasing an app or, if they already had, an update for the app to match with that meme phone?
They haven't released anything yet.
That's the first big release.
They are releasing the TokenCard Wallet App and the TokenCard Visa Debitcard.
They are basically the same like MTL, MCO and TenX but much smaller Marketcap.
Partnership confirmed
i am also working on a phone app.
gib money.
It's like BitPay level news.
