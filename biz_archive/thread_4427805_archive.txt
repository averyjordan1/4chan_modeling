Ok so brothers I tought I would contribute to biz what I have learned over the past 6 months doing crypto1.
Never get too greedy.. Greedyness is only gonna make you poor because you trade based on emotions2.
Always Have atleast 70% of your portfolio in bitcoin3.
Put 20% into exchange and buy into the dips of alt coins with a promising future.
Then sell when you are 20-25%+ and rince and repeat4.
Have hobbies outside crypto so the money doesnt blind you.
5.
Have patience.
It's everything.
If you only had patience with bitcoin since 2010 you would be a billionare by now.I really love to help my biz brahs and I would love if my biz brahs helped me get back on my feet again after I lost 3k$ on altcoins in july... Bitcoin address: 1HjhZe3VSaqsRMXwB2P63uDVo7a4gEycLv

Nope, why should I help out biz when its full of retards who lose money everyday?
I even tried on of those biz discords and people are getting justed on shilled coins there.
I keep my trading advice to myself because none of you deserve it, and if I spoonffed you guys, you never listen anyways.
I always listen senpai
If you're not in altcoins now you're late.
You do hold positions on some altcoins right?
>Post generic tips>Beggingfuck off
We're not all bad anon.
Any legit advice would be appreciated
But begging is never the answer.
Id rather fucking starve to death
Have hobbiesYou will always stay poor.

No 2 was true year or two years agoBTC is likley to hit 10k, but is having hard time getting to it.
Manwhile and 20k is still less than 3x moneyNot gonna be easy
Why would we take advice from someone who has to beg for money because he lost it all himself?
