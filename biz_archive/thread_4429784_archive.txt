am i actually retarded?MEW confuses the fuck out of me, i literally cannot get my head around it.
I coded my ethereum wallet myself.
it's pretty easy and you don't have to trust anybody to fuck you over.
Watch a youtube video
What are you trying to do mate?
What questions do you need answering?A lot of this shit can be confusing at first.
I fully understand logging in and my personal key etc.
- it's sending shit from binance to MEW that confuses the hell outta me.Doing a test run with some LINK now to see if it makes it in there.Do you literally just send all tokens/coins to one address?Have tried that, they are useful but not helping with my problems.
All your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens (every token based on Ethereum) all use your Ethereum address, yeah.
So whatever your ethereum address is, just send it all to that.
you are not sending it 'to MEW'.
You are telling Binance to send it to that public address for which you own the private key.
MEW doesn't host anything.
It only provides a node so you can interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
You can download MEW and run it locally, which is very much advised as you'll probably be scammed otherwise someday.
ayyyy lmao
do you remember that time you forgot about 9/11?
