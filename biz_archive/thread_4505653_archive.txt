Ok guys, I've been accumulating Bitcoin for a while, and I'm going to readjust my portfolio, so what coins do you guys recommend?.
Also portfolio thread.
Opinions?
Seems like a good BTC/BCH ratio in case their project Dragonslayer fucks with the network for a while.
Yeah, that's the reason.
My thought was that long term BCH will rise no matter if the Dragonslayer stuff has any effect or not.
But I'm really curious how this will play out on the weekend.
I'm ready for it to suddenly jump to 2K again.
Yeah, easy 2X gains this weekend, followed by a big dump once the Bitcoin difficulty stabilizes.
What the hell do I do?I don't want to buy bitcoin this high..
They will try another flippening (Dragonslayer) in a few days.
Keep an eye on the BTC price.
But it could also go even higher, expect a lot of uncertainty.
Oh we have JUSTED edition :)AST really???
?Jk nothing you can do but wait ....gl anon
Buy and hold DGB
You mean another attack on BTC?
Uncertainty is the bane of my existence.
tfw I had 1Â½btc worth of shitcoins at one point and didn't exchange all to btc.
Never been past 3k
