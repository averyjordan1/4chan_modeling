BTC will probably break its breakout support next hour.
If it does and closes below $8200, great opportunity for a swing trade, sell and rebuy at $8050, earlier if it starts ranging.Cheers.
LIES!
it's going to 10k straight.
The latest rise in price was at a major angle, which indicates that we're dealing with a breakout.
Breakouts either turn into ranges or lead straight back to previous resistance.
Since this breakout didn't have much relative power, I'm 80% sure we're going back to $8050, after which a consolidation and next breakout are to be expected.
Sell for ETH for a double whammy, it's about to go over 360.
why not BCH?
