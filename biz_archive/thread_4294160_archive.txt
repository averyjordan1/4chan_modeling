I've been holding blockcat since 20k sat.
Now 50% down from my intial investment.
Should i crash the 11000 on cryptopia ?
I'm thinking i'll buy it back later after this bitcoin crash is done and after all the fork madness is gone
Crash it with no survivors.
Nice and slow... Bleed all hope out.
Also I'm pretty sure it's a scam, dude posts here a lot saying he did a scam ICO
