What prevents all the crypto market to crash, burn and become one with the soil?Honest question.We are here trading all the day on the hope that this thing will be used in the future, this whole BTC pump of 2017 was nothing about people buying bitcoins to use at a shop or move capital around, it was mostly pure speculation, based on the fact that crypto one day will actually do something useful, therefore be in high demand.We get new coins everyday, one to buy power, one to buy car parking time one to borrow the water to flush the shitter, none of them has a considerable transaction number in what it is supposed to do.Volatility makes it impossible to use as a currency, imagine buying a car with BTC and a month after you discover that with the same amount you could have bought the same car and a full set of wheels for it, would you use it again instead of just hodling?I only see privacy coins as something that could avoid crashing totally, due to people needing to do weird shit with money that as of today is not traceable like fiat.I mean it is fun and all, I made 800USD out of a 2000 investment with the last BCH-BTC shitshow but I'm becoming more skeptical now than I was when didn't buy BTC in 2015.
