10$ ?
Its heading to 1$ - 0$ yes.
linkfag ?seriously, they announced to get a much bigger team and hire like crazy, i have a good feeling about this once-meme-coin now
Lisk was never a meme they are/were slow.
But lately gaining speed.>They have 30 people team and hiring.>More than 100mil buget that can keep them funded for several years.They have to massivly slack off to not do anything of value considering the sheer size of money they have and size of team.
biz isn't talking about it so it has a very bright future.
It will be a big month or 2 for lisk.
you think we will see a dip?
I wanna load up more
Did they fix the issue with all the devs having access to a database with everyone's private key?
