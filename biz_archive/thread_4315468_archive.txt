It just makes no sense.> buy X coin at 0.1 btc (btc 5000$)> btc drops 2500$> sell X coin ar 0.2 btc (btc 2500$)> omg such profit!!!
!you fuck literally made 0 profit what's wrong with some of you?
My account balance is more than double what it was this time yesterday :)
whats that funny sign you're using after 5000 and 2500?
You can sell BCH for tether dumb shit
I'm not talking about the price of BTC or BCH you fuck.
I'm talking about people using BTC as general price.
I bought some coins at 0.01 they're only worth 0.007 now, but I bought them when BTC was 2.5k.
In satoshis I lost money but in cash value I made a huge profit.
