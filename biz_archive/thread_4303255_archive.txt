I'm tired of this fucking Bitcoin dick waging contest eth is taking care of any pull back my portfolio saw out of BTC for now boys
this week will be big for the ethbtc, look at the 2hr chart and you can see we will have a golden cross tommorrow, that means Tuesday and Wednesday will be big gainers
i just bought in not too long agoi hope ETH makes a nice come backit's been a whileBCH is too volatile and supremely manipulated at the moment.
i feel bad for people FOMOing
ETH is a comfy hold right now.
i'm going to read up on the current state of affairs but could someone do me a solid and just hit me up with a tiny explanation of what's going down with ETH..pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee and thank you
Thats not bitcoin cash

eth hasnt done shit since august and got outperformed by most of the other top10 coins since.and rightly so.
a sneeze from vitalik is all eth needs to tumble down like its the end.
What?
