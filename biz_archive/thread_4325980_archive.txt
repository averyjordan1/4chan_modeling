i haven't slept in 40 hours, can someone help me out my brain stopped working.lets say i bought a coin at 0.027BTCand it dropped down to 0.020If I sold it at 0.020 and it dropped lower to .017 and I bought it back, am I in the green or am I juust fucking retarded.This is all hypothetical.
just give up
you're right.
you sold at a loss and then bought back after it lost more, if it wont go up further than .017 u just make your loss bigger
dont give up, just start with money you can lose because you will lose at the beginning, thats normal.But soon you will get a feeling on what to buy or not.
Never buy because /biz/ says so.
If something looks legit put some effort in it and investigate before put your money in it.
Never put more money in than you can handle to lose.After getting the first wins try to cut 50% off and put in a wallet or get fiat for it and put it away for saving.Also get into some youtube vids explaining what you should do before doing anything.
You probably dont know what you are doing when you ask questions like this.
Information is your best friend here
You're retarded man, buying back at 0.017 doesn't put you automatically in the green, it'll need to go up first.
If you invested $1K at 0.027 and it tanks to 0.020 you would've lost 25.93%, so now you have $740.7.
If you buy back at 0.017 it'll need to shoot up 35.1% for you to break even and recoup your losses

YOU CAN NOT LOOSE AT THE BEGINNING.
