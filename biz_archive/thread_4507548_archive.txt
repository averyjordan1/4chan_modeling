Do you think that ICO’s market is going down?
Lot’s of scam and shit projects, expensive marketing for good teams, investors do not like to invest in ICO because token will go down after release on exchange… So my propose how we can regulate and save ICO.
This round-system is aimed to solve the most important problem, we do not give the team the whole amount at once, because it will actually destroy the startup, breaking down the founders’ desire to develop the project or to change the original business model.A startup is a search for a functioning business model, few people can immediately visualize the development of the project for months and years ahead.Our plan: - Pre-seed roundup to 50k$-150k$ Requirements• Whitepaper 1.0What for?• MVP 1.0 • due diligence Project gives in Tokensup to 10%Seedup to 300к$-500k$Requirements• WP 1.0 + business plan• MVP 1.0• due diligenceWhat for?• Website• MVP 2.0 • VP 2.0• Community creationo Community standard • Primary marketing• Legal issueso jurisdictiono company organizationo banko information about the founderso due dilegenceProject gives in Tokens:up to 15%Round A1 000 000$ - 3 000 000$Requirements:• Website• MVP 2.0• VP 2.0 + business plan• Community creation • Primary marketing• Legal issuesWhat for?• Scalingo marketingo communityo Road show• MVP 3.0Project gives in Tokens:up to 20%ICO from 5 000 000$The introduction of tokens to the market:from 35% up to 55%This round-system is aimed to protect the interests of investors/backers from fraud and incompetent teams.
Even if the project has a strong team and a strong idea, this still does not guarantee success of the project, because the business model may simply not work, and it will be clear right after the Seed stage.
In this case investors lose from 100к$ to 500 к$, but not dozens and hundreds of millions of dollars as it is now.
