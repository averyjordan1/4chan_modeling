I lurked for a while, and want to join on the pump and dumps; but I see a problem.
None of these coins have any value (obv), but we all know its a pump, so we all buy hoping to dump.
Its a game of hot potato.The problem I have is that my bags are too big?
If I go in with .3BTC (which is not much) on one of these shit coins, I can ride the pump, but when the dump begins, I can sell .3BTC.
Faggots would say, "buy less".
Well If i buy .05BTC, then the gains made are shitty, even if it 2x.WTF BIZ!??!
no one knows?
Don't wait until the dump begins, retard, take profits on the way up.
4498988Since a mongoloid like you probably needs more explanation, that means sell increasingly large fractions as the price increases.
Eg., if you think the top is gonna be 2x, sell 10% of your stack at a 20% increase, 15 at 40 and 60, 20 at 80, and then you only have to sell 30% at the start of the dump.
Yes, the average profit is lower this way but you can't time the top, and this way you can sell more BTC worth.
Yo, that is some real shit.
You make way less, but you actually make some, since you sell it all.
Who would have thought one of would be worth something.
Thanks
All good.
This is super basic trading strategy.
You can adjust the percentages for how risky you're willing to get but it's better to sell everything at some profit than be left holding bags.
Retard.
Never buy on an up trend, unless its days and days long.
Then tou can ride the wave up.
Otherwise, dollar cost average and buy when coins are crashing.
What?
Where did I say buy on the way up?
"Take profits" means sell.
As in you already have some when it's going up, and you sell on the way up and don't try to time the top with your whole stack.
