Realistically, how likely is it for LINK to hit even just Ripple's CURRENT marketcap in 1 to 2 years?
Im not going to put money im not willing to lose but it seems like a good lottery ticket kind of bet.
If it gets SWIFT sponsorship it will hit it within a month.
Otherwise it will hit it a few months after the network goes live.
Most people will tell you they expect it to happen.
If blockchain really takes off, LINK has a real use case.
But its going to take big institutions to actually use LINK before it will go up.
Ripple might be too much, but I'd take Decred's market cap.One big partnership+bittrex should do the trick
Santander will use be using chainlink oracle solutions in june-july next year.
Prove it.
Decred's marketcapIt already hit that on SIBOS hype alone.
Even digibyte reached a 500m marketcap.
Why the fuck does every LINK thread start with>realistically
Because with every project with genuine hype we have moonboys that expect $50 LINK EOY.
because they were "unrealistic" before LOL
This is the most realistic outcome in the coming 6 months.
Longer than that is hard to predict.
Depends how it goes
