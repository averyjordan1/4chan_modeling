This rapid growth really frightens me.
Never trust crypto currencies which use verification for accounts.
you can lose everything.
NEO officially announced cooperation with Chinese authorities.
This is the end of decentralization.
Only free coins will give you freedom.
like Diamond (DMD) bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=580725.0

Being this new.

What news made this insane pump happen?
WHY DIDNT I BUY MORE
looks like the pump is over
im confused, do i ride the wave?, do i sell at $34-$35?, is btc gonna correct itself?, why is the sats going up but price going down?
What was your entry point?
I think bitcoin is dropping IDK my bittrex wallet just went from 16k to 15k though and it's not because of neo
k for me to break even btc-wiseI certainly hope so
I did... but I only have 2. kek fuck me.

rumor china lifting bans next monday, neo gona go to $1000
我的朋友!谢谢。中国人有最大的鸡巴。信我啊!现在去你妈的!
Source?
It's going to crash retard
where do you get news on china?
i put some money into a few ico's before the ban and those coins got delisted.
curious if they'll ever get listed again or if they're gone for good.
right after it goes to $100
When china comes with NEws that NEO is the platform they support , remember ETH fomo?Just watch for that 2.0
ITS GOING UP AGAIN
BIGLY
Time in china 4:24
tried to accumulate more and ended up buying at $35, someone please tell me if going to go up past this.
>lose tons of money on neo>move to link>lose more money>stay link% recovery>if i had stayed in neo it would have been a disgusting 20% reboundNEO not even once
Read this42506504251604
Bought the FOMO twice!
t. dumbass
link is gonna moon while neo is gonna stay with it s measly +/- 10%get fucked
Shitcoin vs China's pride and joy.
...I think I'll stick to NEO
Why not both?
I bought some link at 22.
Buy low sell high.
But I think you are more familiar with another strategy.
Why is it mooning bros?
Huge surprise checking blockfolio this morning
who /qtum/ here
I'm in both and I'm tired of that stupid little war between the two.Both Neo and Qtum are great in their own regards and they don't even do the same things.
its going to at least 570 today, and still its quite low level, remember ATH was well over 1 million
