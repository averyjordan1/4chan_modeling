WHEN THE FUCK CAN I BUY THIS COIN??
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa
6 more days anon
https://steemit.com/icon/@roosterred/icon-icx-ico-a-promising-coin-with-major-flawsI was positive about this token until I found out that the leaders were literally slandering me on Telegram (I am looking to sue you pieces of shit) and being shady motherfuckers.
They aren't to be trusted.
Fuck them.
They are liars.
Dirty liars.
I will sue these pieces of shit for slandering my analysis.
Fucking liars and no good thieves.
Don't think your lies will be unchallenged.
Your deceit will be paid for 10 fold.
I can't emphasize how much these pieces of shit, whom I tried to honestly help, slandered me.
I am trying to build an honest business and they fucking lie and slander about my research?
They are fucking done.
I already contacted two lawyers.
I give honest advice and these fuckers dare to fucking say I am saying absurd shit I never said?
FUCK YOU I WILL BURY YOU!
What the fuck are you on?
I'm sure they're very scared!
Good boy points can really hurt if used correctly!
KEK.
expect alot of fud on this one as noobs couldnt pass the kyc were going to the moon without them, srs buy this if you even see it under 3x on launch
Nothing.
Go on Telegram.
These pieces of shit are lying about my articles.
They are saying I said that ICX is pegged to Ethereum, which is a fucking lie, and hurts my business.
They also lie about the market cap of their coin.
I said they were raising a total 300k Eth market cap.
They did.
They lie about my analysis and say they "only" raised 150K (which is the ICO market cap, not the total market cap).
There are at least a dozen times where these fuckers lied about my analysis on their chat.
Blatant lies.
I am going to enjoy suing the shit out of these cunts.
If they are not, they will be.
I don't fuck around.
I am RoosterRed, and I stand by my analysis .
These fuckers will pay for slandering me.
I will bring a lawsuit in CA against them (the laws are favorable there).
All jokes, good luck if you pursue Anon hahaha.
I like the conviction.
These fuckers are the lowest of the low.
And they will be fucking brought to heel .DID YOU FUCKING THINK I WOULDN'T HIRE A LAWYER YOU FUCKS?
Stop shitting up every ICX thread.
NOBODY cares about you.
Create a blog or something, this isn't twitter or reddit.
There is no conviction.
There is a fucking company who is slandering me and thinks they can get away with it.
They will fucking burn.
Missed out on the presale hey?
I would be pissed too
Yeah, tell that to the American judge who says you have to give every dirty cent back.
FUCK YOU.
I was honest, and you lie about my work?
FUCK YOU!
I WILL FUCKING KILL ALL OF YOU!
Remeber when they photoshopped their logo onto a screen or some shit after their ICO... can't trust Koreans..
I was told this by another Korean.
Dear ICON, FUCK YOU FUCKERSSincerely,RoosterRedp.s.
you chose to make an enemy you will never forget
lol what?
seek help man.
there are actually pretty good drugs on the market these days for schizophrenia induced paranoia.
lolyou will burn
RED FLAGS FOR SHITCOIN "ICON":>ICON implemented KYC AFTER the contribution, and it was reported on plebbit that an email (screenshot) from from ICON stated that ICON would be KEEPING ALL THE ETH AND NOT DISTRIBUTING TOEKS IF THE INVESTOR DID NOT not fulfill their KYC requirements.
PAUSE AND REREAD THAT SHIT.
ALL VERIFIED.
The community outcry made them retract, but the judgement required to make such a TERRIBLE decisions that are nothing short of EXTORTION calls into question the viability and authenticity of the entire project.THE ONLY THING THAT FORCED THEM FROM SCAMMING ALL THE PRESALE WAS THE FACT THAT THEY COULDNT SCAM MORE PEOPLE FOR THE ICO>ICON aims to enable private enterprise blockchains.
Literally pointless.
Basically saying "oh here I can connect you guys but you have to use this shitty meme coin I made up" >ICON's whitepaper contains a lot of English language spelling mistakes.
>ICON is claiming to have more features than other competing Blockchains by comparing its yet-to be developed features with current features of blockchains still under development.
This is misleading to the un-informed reader (you).
CONTINUED>ICON which seems to be a (several) proprietary blockchain(s), is comparing itself to protocols like Bancor.
(While misleadingly saying that Bancor's consensus mechanism is PoW)The link to the white-paper of the Loop Fault tolerance algorithm (LFT) which is the consensus mechanism for ICON, re-directs to an empty repository.
The only reference we could find is a link to an Apache FLINK improvement proposal.
This makes us doubt that LFT was developed by ICON.
Fucking.
Scam.>Established competitors in active development like COSMOS (which is partnered with BOSCOIN)% yearly inflation is something un-heard of in the crypto-space & even central bank cuck fiat currencies.
YOURE LOSING 20% A YEAR AUTOMATICALLY WHAT THE LITERAL FUCK ARE THEY FUCKING THINKING>No vesting mentioned for the team's tokens.>Team has 6 product managers.
SIX.
Too dedicated to shill to you.If you bought into ICON in the presale I am sorry to hear.
Expect FUD from noobs who missed out on wanchain / Icon / Powerledger.Icon is partially funded by the South Korean government by the way.
spelling mistakes on a white paper?
