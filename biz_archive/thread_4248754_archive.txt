Hello /biz/I thought this would be the right board.I just have a couple of questions regarding to Bitcoin.Ive been reading quite alot of articles about Bitcoin, with both people arguing you should invest andyou shouldn't.
But honestly, in my opinion about what Ive read,it seems to me that this is really the currency ofthe future.Should you invest in Bitcoin?Is Bitcoin the currency of the future?Why do some claim every fucking month that themarket will crash?Do any of you here have Bitcoins, and what is yourexperience with it?Im just really curious about this, so please correct me if Im wrong on anything.
>currency of the futureof the future hobos, you mean
