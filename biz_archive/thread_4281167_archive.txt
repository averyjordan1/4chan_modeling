Ummm... why is BCC and BTG up 30-50%???
hours until the difficulty adjustment on BTC.
After that, if the miners leave BTC for BCH, BTC will never recover.
It will take many hours to do one transaction and the flippening will be completely cemented.
pajeets and ching chons plan to pnd every btc fork to death
