The next BTC dump will be to $4500, and the BCH pump will be to $3800.
The one after that will bring them to parity.

ignore losers on /biz/, btc legacy shills everywhere, wait until fork in 6 hoursNow everyone on the inside has confirmed 4k ATH in next 24 hours, so I'll probably buy some more now and some more when it hits 2k, gunna let btc climb before the dump into BCH, i love how obvious this is, btc literally climbing as we come upto the fork, painfully obvious this is end for btc

Technically, the voices in your head don't qualify as insider knowledge.
Look at when my last post was, then look at what BTC/BCH started doing.You might want to go ahead and create/download some new pink wojacks, you're gonna need em.
