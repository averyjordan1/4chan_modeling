what am i going to with all these gold bars ?!?
put them in your peepee hole
buy bitcoin cash
Make jewelry?
I mean what else could they possible be used for these days?
Nice.
I miss my (far smaller) Gold+Silver stockpile but it's an indulgence that's only worth it if you've already made a shitload on crypto - Congrats if that's the case OP
Depends at what price you bought in
WHATAMGONNADO
Bags worth having at least
I find it weird that you can just buy gold in the same packaging as batteries
fill bowl with hot/warm wax>put your dick in it, to create an anon's-dick-shaped hole>wait for wax to cool down>heat up gold and pour liquid gold into wax hole>wait>charge the hordes of golddigger whores 100$ for each use of your literal golden dick>buy bitbean with profits
check if its real first of all, most of the internet sold gold is fake
I'll buy the pamp, I love that design.
I can only pay in chain link tho
Fuggg...how would you check?
I got decent brick of these too
Bite them really hard to make sure theyâ€™re real, like in old western movies.
Make sure you try each one.
They're sealed in these pretty cases :( no bite muh hermetically sealed gold.
Thank god all my bitcoins are real.
my sides
drill one to see if it has tungsten inside
Beginning of the year threads on biz were about selling fake gold in packages because people would be less likely to check if it's real
Go to a professional, they have X-ray fluorescence analysis devices that can tell the elemental composition.
Also you don't have to take them out of the package with this method.
you stole those from work.
I'm telling
You test em and find out they are fake just a few months ago there was threads about how to sell these fake gold bars.
