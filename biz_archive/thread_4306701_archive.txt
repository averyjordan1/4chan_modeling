lmao
Difficulty will shoot up 400% in about one day.It's going to be interesting.
kekbcash is literally unstoppable
what does it mean pls tell
That there's barely anything to mine.
Miners went for it for easy money, but soon will run out of blocks to mine and dump this shit without ever looking back and then rack crazy profits from overblown BTC transaction fees.
Means that bcash is not being used to do transactions and nobody is holding bcash outside exchanges.
Bitcoin Unlimited in March, the UAHF in June, the pre-BCash FUD scare in July, and this Fall's 2X propadanga.
FOUR big block failures in eight months -resulting in nearly $8,000 Bitcoin, and we're supposed to worry about a newly hard-forked BCash?
Gimme a break.
If this canâ€™t hold above $2k, difficulty spikes and miners are fucked.
Well deserved for playing such petty games.
Isn't that just a product of the block times being ~24 times shorter?
What does this same breakdown look like for BTC?
wow any1 not in BCH right now need to leave /bizweak hands traded for strong alpha handsso much money this is the end of core
4306829So it's a mega-PnD?
There's a timelimit to this BTCatastrophy?
miners are fuckedThey have BTC with its comfy ridiculous transaction fees readily waiting for them.
Pretty much this
The easiest way to put it is that while people are buying BCH, nobody is using them.
It's not even money at this point, BCH's value is a result of people seeking refuge from BTC and whales taking advantage of the situation.
Lol no.
Bitcoin cash succeeds Bitcoin.
As news of increased acceptance and support rises the market will react, sending cash skyward
