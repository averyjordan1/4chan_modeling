You're Australian and buying ASX trash instead of POWR??
What coin is this?
i dont actualy have any money i just have money in this desu...
hey fellow aussie.
why has bluescope gone up?
4511902well the FIRST quesiton to ask is: was bluescope EVER on the down?
answer: NOthey just got a new ceo and everoyne had a bitch fit and sold as they were at all time high for a long while, so this is just a correction if anything.
and they will continue to "correct" on an "upward direction"i wouldnt say buy while u can but.. well maybe i guess?
ever since Sandon Capital had a lil chat with bluescope theyve been going very well
tfw i just realised i use google as only source of information to invest in stock marketalls well that ends well!!
interesting.
i've only ever traded crypto.
how do I get into trading bluescope and other aussie non crypto companies?
these are like safer investments but take longer to go up right?
get ur tax file number and start an account online with amscot they got a few different options with accounts etc.
take a look.
its not too hard to set up an account or anything
and yeah they are bluescope when i was got them were considered blue chip they still are i suppose but not so much now
FOURTEEN DOLLARS BOYS MOOOOOOOOOOONING BUY WHILE YOU STILL CAN
SHES TANKIN BOYS SELL SELL SELL SELL SELLBUY MEI.ASX QUICK THEY JUST STARTED THEIR MAIDEN DRILL 3 DAYS AGO!!
