Daily reminder to never FOMO during a pump unless you're using stop losses and stop gainsCrypto is based on hype, so if hype dies the price will dry up and allow a better entry pointsee Stellar and LINK
Not how it worksIf the hype die the pump diesWhy would you want to get in once the hype dies
There was no hype for powr and it kept risingPowr is different and belongs in the 1 billion dollar market cap club
because if you want to enter for a long position, youd rather have more of the item at a lower pricesee you when it dumps like every coin after the news dies
You guys are alright, dont go to hodl school tomorrow...I will shill you a nice discord group I just became part ofWe pump on bittrex, +10k members, active channels on trading/rumors and admins who find a good coin to pump and shill.

Only works until the times it doesn't.Neo pumped and went up 20% instantly and I didn't fomo in..
If i would of fomo'd in I would of still made another 30% before the end of the pump.The better advice is not to get emotionally attached to your coins and remember to take profits while your coin is in the spotlight, even if you really believed in that coin you will probably have a time in the future to buy in cheaper wen the hype dies
don't forget those tight stop gains, it's essential when trading crypto
news here is hype of a new coina good way is to think "how more vectors would this coin have to grow during the pump"but also look how I said "stop gains" which will stop you from getting too greedy
