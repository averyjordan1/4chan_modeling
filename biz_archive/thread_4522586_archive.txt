I, for one, am thankful not to be an Arkie
Well u miss huge gainz, whats there to be thankful of
Started in July year with 6k.
Lucked out with WTC by buying a stash at 0,50 cents.
Portfolio went up to 18k... withdrew 8k to cover my initial investment plus 2k profit.The 10k I still had in crypto is now 16k.
This is pretty much free money generating more free money.
I can't put the feeling of comfort I have into words.Also, I am heavily in ARK OP is a faggot.
