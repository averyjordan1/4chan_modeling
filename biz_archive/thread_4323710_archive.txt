>buy a coin that already x40'dno thanks
People were saying this at 5x, 10x, and 15x
Your loss.
Every coin has x40'd.
The difference is this one still has a tiny marketcap and all it needs is a decent exchange and it will rocket.

What was ICO price again?
0.0001428?

w.e faggot are you a whale?stop fudding you link fag
Yes.
And ETH was $290-295.We told anons here to get on the whitelist.
Join the ICO, it's easy money.
Just one eth will be plenty.>Scamcoin>Lmao what if they ship a rock>It's ethbetSo hardly anyone listened.
And now, a week later, every ETH you contributed to this ICO is worth 1 BTC.
what difference does it makeMy blockfolio isn't adding up and I was wondering if I had put the right ICO price in.
Was in 0.0001428 or not?
There are barely any whales so I don't know what you guys are talking about.
This thing is gonna explode when it eventually hits Binance.
Expect a dip when the new exchange is released and it isn't binance tho haha.
$3-4 end of year no problem.
Then it can be a useless token.
Thanks.
Yeah this is my best buy in ages
 ETH for 7000 token, 1/7000 = 0.0001428571429
Yeah I suck at maths so wouldn't have thought to do that.
I'll remember for next time, cjeers
HAHAHAH someone just dumped 80 eth worth and it was unphased
This thing is gonna explode when it eventually hits Binance.classic
please stop posting about confido, i sold at $0.65
reason it's x40 it's because the ICO was 400k or something.
still super cheap
