I'm one of the anons who told you all to buy BCH the past few days, congrats to those who ignored the core shills and listened.
DO NOT PANIC SELL.
expect BCH to dip over the weekend, because most of the volume is from S. Korea and they are buying with fiat.
banks don't wire transfer on weekends, so volume and price will likely drop short-term.
REMEMBER, the fork upgrade is scheduled for this Monday.
all the Koreans will have fiat re-loaded and ready to pump again.
target price is $2000.
good luck

I saw a thread after s2x was cancelled saying "if you dont buy bch right now you deserve to be poor" so I went all-in on bch, up 3000$ because of that call.
if it was you, thank you.
if it looks like people are treating it as a sell the news event, I'll look for a selling point and then look for a bottom later.
otherwise I'm holding long-term4297182lol, if I was nervous I could just sell now for a 2x on my money.
you guys can still get in over the weekend if you don't want to miss out again
