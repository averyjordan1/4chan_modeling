REQ or NEO?I don't want to put my monies into very risky shitcoins like DCORP or NULS.
he's not a NEO naziyikes, fomo will kick in as soon as we moon
We might pump req here: https://discord.gg/Yh96D8v
REQ easily- it still hasn't properly mooned yet compared to NEO.
Kyber will set you free.
Kek, I created that.
Glad you like it.Also, REQ is the flavour of the week (not saying Kyber isn't a good hold though)
Nice one lad.
Oh ok.
But I've made my bed with NULS and I'm riding that moonshot to infinity and beyond.
Good luck though lads.
NEO has more opportunity in the short term, I'm sure REQ will pay off too but NEO will be $100+ by the end of this year and who knows how long REQ we'll be waiting for REQ to become relevant.
I've been in the dcorp slack/telegram the past 4 months.
the team is solid and the coin is just starting to pick up volume
