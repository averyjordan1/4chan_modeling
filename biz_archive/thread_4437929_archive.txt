found a wallet.dat file on my old pc from march of 2013 and wondered if I bought some bitcoin and forgot about it.
Was up till 6 in the morning trying to recover it and finally got it.
I was thinking I had 8-16k in there.
Got it open.
A whopping .00009 BTC.
About .78 cents.Anyone else think about killing themselves for knowing about bitcoin and not getting in?
I've been in a constant state of poverty my entire adult life.
I think I always will be.
Get in and start making some money now you goofying doofus
I bought .03 BTC at 6800 during the dip and am now just educating myself on the different markets and the best way to make money.
I guess i'm just accepting that I won't be making life changing money, but just supplementing savings with interest really.
I can only afford to invest 400 a month, so i need to maximize that and not lose it all.
This.
You can still make a ton of money with crypto.
I knew about BTC since 2011 but finally decided to buy in 2017 mid-june and I've made some big gains already
Well that's a good start.
If you want life changing amounts you will need to invest in alts not just BTC
>Had a computer with 3 BTC on it from a tip I got for a forum post>Ended up losing my job and home >Get back on my feet and completely forget about bitcoin>checked the price a year ago and raged hardIts okay though I'm pretty smart and can program, I think I'd be safe involving myself in this ecosystem if I become a developer.
Gotta self-teach though.
I feel you anon.
