What happens to ETH when BCH becomes #2?
i love that meme, pls make more
This image and its variants make me laugh like a fucking retard every time
ETH will creep into first place after cash kills BTC and then people realize BACH has no devs or roadmaps.Basically 3 months of BACH going to ~5K, then ETH coming through, unless Monero or something can pull out the clout to get normie and Chinese behind them
Hard correction is imminent, Korean pumpers sold and are sleeping.
Sell now buy back at 0.05
no devsWrong#>or roadmaps.Top kek, roadmaps are for unfinished projects you faggot nigger
what devs?And roadmaps help show promise for the coin.
In its current state it is barely an upgrade to BTC
Isn't there like 6 or 8 distinct dev teams working on BCH?
