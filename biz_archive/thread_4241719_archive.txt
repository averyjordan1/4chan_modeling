ONLY ONE MILLION EVERXBCThis coin will be huge in the future /biz/ hates XBC but you shouldn't write it off, it's worth looking into, far less shitty than it seems at first glance and definitely underappreciated for its potential longevity and network strengthApproximate Total Coin Supply by Year (Inflation fixed at 20%)Year Coins Minted Coins2016 90000 180002017 108000 216002018 129600 259202019 155520 311042020 186624 373242021 223948 447892022 268738 537472023 322486 644972024 386983 773962025 464380 928762026 557256 1114512027 668707 1337412028 802449 1604892029 962938 1925872030 1000000 0
You want to be rich get the fuck in here

I'm still here OP.
Nice volume today on Poloniex.
XBC wallet really does run well.
Roaming folder is 556 MB as of now, so very light and can be run by almost anyone.
This is after almost 4 years.
The coin is continually on the top few for connections on cryptopia and the network is very stable.
Also it runs on tor without any problems or setup which helps the network overall.
With that level 3 outage yesterday I couldnt load internet sites for 3 hours but XBC didn't lose any connections.
This is unironically my favorite coin OP.
Don't give up.
We already have made it if you consider where we were a year ago, but we are going to make it a lot more IMO
How/where do I buy/mine?
Poloniex or cryptopia (poloniex recommended for smaller spreads).
It's a hybrid coin but the mining feature is not actively pursued and is a failsafe to move the network if staking weight is ever insufficient.
This hasn't been the case in the past year to year and a half with consistent/growing network weight that keeps everything moving regularly (apart from periodic spikes when a large holder who hasn't staked in some time will come on and raise the weight until they stake enough to lose it).
so to "mine" the coin you just leave the wallet open and unlocked like any proof of stake coin.
I have had experience with many proof of stake coins and xbc has not had any of the typical problems they face over my year of watching and using it.
it's very stable.
it has hardly any adoption (shoutout to pexpeppers and the VPN sites that can be found on bitcoinplus.org) but its supply and staking fundamentals as well as network strength, general ethos, and simple recognizable branding make it a good dark horse store of value IMO.
adoption in some form will have to come, but it has favorable characteristics as is.
you have to have patience though.
it's probably better to set a low bid rather than just buy right now.
you may miss the boat if this is really the moon but you should be looking to get in for a good price slow and hold for a long time rather than fast money.
I will hold it regardless of whether merchants adopt just for its properties as a hedge against btc.
If you cost average it as a btc holder I think it's a better hedge than even bch or other alts because the network is very reliable and the holders generally seem mature and long-term oriented from the price action in the past.
people think unit supply doesn't matter but it does in the sense that a smaller supply gives the price action better "resolution" in that the market cap varies less with the price action than large supply coins.
that aspect combined with network strength, place on polo, and the other factors I mentioned are all reasons I think it's a good hedge against btc and worth running wherever you have 556 mb free
Fugg, when the BTC hits my Coinbase I'm buying one full XBC a week for at least a month.
