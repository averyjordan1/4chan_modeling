>Got an interview for an operations analyst for a F500 tomorrowI have no idea what this job entails.
What should I say?
tell them you are good at analyzing trends in crypto coins
You're going for a job as a Formula 500 racing driver?
Cool!
Must be exciting.
Just turn up and do some handbrake turns in the carpark and I'm sure you'll get the job.
tell em you can analyze their wifes and girlfriends and you can get them faggots cucked.
because you got 4chan alpha male experience in making other guys into cucks.
tell em you can analyze any female properly to teach her to cuck her males
tell them you have the sauce for pic
>At the end of the interview when they ask if you have questions>Stare intently>Do not say a word>Concentrate all willpower to defecate in pants>Refuse to get up or leave>This is a demonstration of your resolve
tell them u got a big cock and will impregnate the first female employee you see there with your potent seed
>operations analystSounds like a load of shite, just throw a bunch of buzzwords at the wall and see what sticks
Ahahahahaha
Seductively tell them you'll "anal-ise" their "operations"
Say the word synergy.
You seem like you know what the fuck to say in an interview.
Any more tips?
Share all your rare Brittanys with them

This is obviously a meme job, so you need to act like an ubernormie to get it.
Try too hard/act too autistic and you will not get the job.
