You just cant get that kind of service with blockfolio.
Coinigy automatically keeps track of your balances across almost all exchanges.
iOS app coming out this year.
At least that will make it easier to be a phone slave.

Coinigy is a trading platform.
You link the api to whatever exchange you're trading on.First month is free but it's well worth the subscription if you make any kind of money trading.
