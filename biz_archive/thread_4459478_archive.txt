I've done research.
Maybe too much.
I've read news and white papers.
I've followed shill patterns and ignored coins.So much potential, but I can't choose where to park my goddamn money.
It usually comes down to "fuck it, I'm going back to ETH", but real moons will happen elsewhere.
Help me choose, because at this point it's a gamble among these:- Komodo (Smart Privacy)- Cardano ("Gen 3" Coin)- Aragon (DAO well done)- Monero (The King)- NAV (?!
)- AEON (The Prince)- VOISE (New unpumped coin)SOSO?OSOS
invest everything in civicIt is going to be the Peoples Republic of China's go to crypto coin.shit is so cheap right now but soon it will moon.
I'm not moving outside of my coin list.
I've looked into CIVIC and I'm not sold.
Monero from the list you gave.NULS if you want to look and take risk
I'm really leaning towards Monero.
I believe in the 1k+.
