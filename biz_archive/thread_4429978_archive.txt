What does /biz/ think about Waves?
Will it become a multi-billion dollar project?
Will it become a top 5 project?
bumps
I don't see much interest in Waves Platform except on Bitcointalk forum.
I like this coin.
It never had Whales manipulating prices.
This might be one of the overlooked crypto.
It's great for trading because of its predictable dips.
It also looks like a good longterm hold.
It does everything ethereum does but worse and without smart contracts or the rich dapp ecosystem.
Smart Contracts will be introduced soon though
How about you stop talking about it op.
Why?
why are you posting this?
for what reason?explain, do it, because reasons
Waves went up by +/- 50% since a few weeks.
Good gains today as well.
Because I want /biz/ opinion?
Hold waves before the smart money roles in.
feel like big things are coming niggas.
$10 soon
