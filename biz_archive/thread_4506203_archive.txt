What does the new mining hardware mean for Bitmain and BCH?
I was a long term holder but I sold because these will make ASICboost obsolete and thus disincentivize BCH for the chinese miners.
I get the feeling this will be a pump and dump for them.Thoughts?
Agreed.
Bitmain will probably try to come back with some upgraded miner, but it won't be competitive.
And the new hardware is being made available to other competitors with the aim of further decentralising mining, and that's the polar opposite of what Bitmain stands for.
I'd say, long term, they're fucked.
