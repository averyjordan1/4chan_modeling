I say the NEO news turns out to be something retarded and pointless.I say the market reacts negatively to it, and a dump commences as all of /biz/ screams "those tricky chinks got us again!"
wasn't bch like a week ago?anyway, can't wait to buy up all your cheap NEO.
remember, an announcement of an announcement is pure faggotry scam tier shit.
I sold my bags already at 41, will reenter at 36-37 tonight.
max it can go 45, and dump back to 30.
I cant take risk with this shit.
4456754You know in you're hearts NEO is the one.Believe.
Yes you are the only one, you're a unique little snowflake
Part of why its at 30 is because people believe the ban will be lifted in the end of this year.
If the announcement is really just 3 new devs, then i can see people dumping this to 20-25 dollars since people start feeling like the ban lift will not happen.but if it happens its moon to $100 in 2 days
No, I did too.
I sold 1k NEO at 46.
Waiting for at least 35 to buy back in.
Only idiots think the announcement will actually be anything ground breaking.
You people still exist?
The NEO council themselves said the news wasn't about regulations or even China.
Dear God if I have to explain this one more time.
IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE MORE GOD DAMN TIME.
then it will have a slow and painful death starting by next year.
each month the ban doesnt get lifted its -5%
Neither its the 3 fucking new devs u dumbasses
WRONG
chinese speaker here saw streamIt is true that the announcement was 3 new devs
Proof?
I can't find it anywhere.
I'm so excited for these cheap bags lol.
