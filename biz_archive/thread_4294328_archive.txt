There is something inherently wrong with this world when one man can make more than another in a matter of seconds by simply clicking a few buttons, than the other can by slaving away his entire life.
There isn't going to be a patch for this
only thing wrong there is the slave being blissfully unaware of the button man
They're taking the risk of losing their money in a matter of seconds as well.
>Button man here
Slave away life>Guaranteed payment>Button clicking>No guarantees whatsoeverPretty fair.
And the wageslave can participate too
We nees a real life hard-fork
they have the money to lose, while some other jackoff can work hard his entire life and have nothing to show for it
Think of it from another perspective.
It's just wealthy people gambling.
Nothing more.
Is just money nothing more, pieces of paper we created so we dont have to kill each other to get a bite of food
scared money dont make no money
Where does the first man get his money from in the first place?
There's nothing stopping the wageslave from investing.
Life aint fair son.The sooner you accept that the better.
do you know how much money bill gates spends on therapy?
I'd rather be broke.
I know I surround myself with people who would help me.
There's nothing wrong with this.
It is called survival of the fittest.
Poor people look for a new job.Rich people look for a new opportunity.
