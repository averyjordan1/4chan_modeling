Is it gonna moon too?
$100 end of year
Sweett dud
thistop buy right now
Would ETH be a better invest?
Were about to moon get in!
Nahh, LTC has better chance of doubling short term.
There is a psychological aspect to it.
Most normies rather hold a full ltc, rather than 0.01 btc.
Also, its a silver coin, it's an L instead of a B, it's like a Quarter and a dime haha
Will LTC ever be 7000 like Bitcoin?
It might one day, but it wont ever be more than 5-10% of 1 BTC.
Eh still good for making some cash, i just need that really good deal, guess i missed 2012 and im fucked LOL
also helps that its actually functional
LTC feels pretty undervalued
No its will never moon.
