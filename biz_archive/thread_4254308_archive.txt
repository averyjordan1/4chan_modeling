pump n dump trying to jump on the ASIC trainsorry FTC, you missed it.
The train is owned by GRS and VTC.
nope there's always a pattern vtc gains some steam grs follows and lastly ftc gets some attention but compared to its bigger bros its half % vtc and grs gain
yeah.
its happening now
first VTC and GRS, then comes FTC.
I agree OP
I told you to get out yesterday Asian Whale Club scamming faggot.
You can't hide.
Fuck you.
that's not me bro.. lol
That was me and I already dumped my bags for vertcoin.
I'll get back into.
Feather coin tomorrow or perhaps later tonight depending on how the chinks feel about vtc when they wake up.
Don't have much stake in crypto, but I have some BTC and a few alt coins.
Honestly, should I just trade my 82 XRP(I bought a little just in case it took off) for feather?
