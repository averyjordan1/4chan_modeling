I warned you guys about this yesterday.
It's accumulating on an upwards trend and buy walls are forming.
Again, this isn't even formally listed on ED yet, but is online.
If you're chasing after ED shitcoin pumps, this is the best time to get in.https://etherdelta.com/#0xea097a2b1db00627b2fa17460ad260c016016977-ETH
OH SHIT BOYS WE JUST GOT LISTED
UP WE GO!!!
MOONNNNNNN TIME!!!!!
Doesn't look like a good time unless I wanna bag hold
It's not listed, it's just the custom contract.
Someone is trying to sell useless tokens.
Don't fall for the scam idiots.
Check again, it's listed.
Here's the problem.
To use the network, and download from people you have to pay in Upfiring tokens.Here's the issue with that.
Nobody pays for jack shit on the internet.
The only way to get tokens is to either share (illegal and most people don't do it) OR pay for tokens.Sorry, but I'll stick with PirateBay bros
Oh yeah this is a shitcoin for sure don't get me wrong, but it's mooning right now and definitely isn't going to stop at this rate
God I fucking love arbitrage, finally an easy 2x
The devs haven't even burned all the coins yet and it still hasn't listed on a centralized exchangeI'm debating whether or not to pull my 15x gains rn or bank on potential 150x moon gainz when it hits exchanges/coins are burned.
I wouldn't wait until after.
I always sell the hype to be safe.
being safe didn't get us to the moon4k vs 40k is a fucking monstrous difference
aight well be careful dude
Pull it.
It has like a 5-6 million market cap.
It's not that special of a coin.
You and I would never use it.
That's still got room for sure.
It'll probably hit $8-10mil now that it's listed.
how much was ICO price in ETH?
take out profit 5x, then let winners ride
UFR price dropped like 50% in the last 30minutes, time to buy!
Why
