Pros and cons anons??
Pros are priced in and cons are btc
i legit have no idea what this does but I bought 2k worth of it because it logo is a fucking moon missionso theres that...
the absolute state of /biz/
It's like XRP without the SHIT.IBM is somehow backing it, they have ATMs for it in Asia.Looks promising IMO.
I have ~14,000 of it gonna hold
IBM >we got blockchains n shitbuy XLM
it's comfy as fuck,big partnerships and real use cases in october, supposedly more in the works,still has plenty of room to expand, currently market cap is on the lower end for something that has so much rapid development and adoption, i heard theres more coming up at the end of november, but i don;t remember exactly whathowever, looking as chart, idk what to do, if btc rallys, we'll lose value compared to btc,we're also above 600 million marketcap for the third time since (not including) the moon mission that came with the IBM announcement, and it looks like we might actually hold 600 mil this time around, and if we hold 600 mil, and we keep doing well into end of november we could see another nice move up, so I'm really not sure what to do with my 50k lumen, I really want to sell a big chunk but I'm not sure we'll see another strong dip relative to btcanyone else want to chime in?
fuck it I got 300k I'm holding at least a year, I think it could grow to rival XRP
will also buy any big dips if I still have any purchasing power with my big BCH stack after this bitcoin civil war
why not swing trade,toss aorund even 1/4 of your stack and you could really start to accumulate,especially with those wacky dips we had around the 10th to the 12th.
could have made some really easy +10% trades
It is also much faster than BTC/ETH/Ripple and the costs of transactions are farrrr lower
desu, I play to my strengths which is identifying something undervalued and investing and holdingif I start trading instead of investing I'm just going to wojack myself somehow with emotions
This is much bigger than you expect, to give one reason it is part of SWIFTs answer to Ripple:Hyperledger + Stellar + Chainlink
