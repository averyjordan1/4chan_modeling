I just made 40k today, cashed out 15k through coinbase already.Trips decide where I take a two week vacation and what I do.Quads gets .3 BTC, but only if you give a valid response and not some half assed bullshit.
iceland, its really comfy during the winter
You take a trip to Iceland and check out ÞingvellirNational park and enjoy nature in its purest form.
rolling then answer
What kind of tourism do you like best?Nature?
Urban?I'd say go for Italy, you can have both, and weather is pretty good, not that cold yet.You can make a really nice tour, starting north-east from Trieste, moving to Venice, Verona, Garda lake and surrounding towns, Milano, Torino, and then head south towards the liguria.That would be a very interesting trip, good food, lovely cities.
Iceland is a great place.
Super expensive the the geysers are a must see.
Also saw the northern lights which was awesome.

If you dont like the beach so much maybe go for greece or italia trip?
Portugal is also nice, but its better on the summer.

Don't do anything extravagant.
Do a poor mans holiday while actually having a lot of money.Inter rail, backpacking or hitchhiking.
Meet locals and befriend people without having a clear schedule.
Don't flaunt your money but help those who need some financial aid.
Especially if you're after love; finding an uncut diamond among the poorer class can be very rewarding
