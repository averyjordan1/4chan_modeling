I want to hold this for a year.
Is that a bad idea?
Should I go with Waves instead?
3 digit potential by then desu desu
this desu desu
4407406Why?
That market cap looks rough, and like I said it has faced some competition such as Waves and Segwit.
why do you think that waves and Ark are competitors?
Go with Ark, no question

competition such as Waves and Segwit
I plan to hold Ark for at least two years.
See you on the other side, brother.
Senpai
everything long term!
It is an unwritten rule
Same here man.
It's either Alpha Centauri or bust.
But I could see Ark taking off to ETH levels within 2 years easily.
