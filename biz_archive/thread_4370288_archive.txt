biz, if you've had enough crypto fud for the day, can someone please offer a solution to this unusual problem?1.
need to buy movie from british itunes store.
(can't be found anywhere else, believe me.)2.
payment's billing address must be in uk.3.
i live in the us, all my credit cards are us-based.best i could come up with is purchasing an egift card and registering with a uk address, but i highly doubt that would be permitted.i realize this sounds like a launder, but it's just 7.99 gbp.how the fuck do i solve this, biz?
any ideas bros?
