Do you regret buying Chainlink?
If you could go back would you do anything differently?
Obviously
Nope.
No regrets whatsoever.
Yeah, would sell when it was dipping back from SIBOS.
i bought at 37 and hold it all the way down.
Could have tripled my stack if i didn't fell for the HODL meme.
Lesson learned, i still believe in chainlink though and atm accumulating more.
I've lost 65% on this shit.It's killing me just thinking about it.
no
Been in crypto for a long long time.
Into the 6 figures now.
I have no idea what the ticker even is for ChainLink.
Tried to look it up on tradingview and couldn't find it.I come here every week or so to find some good tidbits but the chain thing got me curious.Are you all fucking retarded?
of fucking course,LINK is a long term investment
dont regret it at all, bought about a little more than 100k @ 25c.
only wish i bought at 15c lol, but im fine with it, as im sure i will make a shitton of cash with it
No because I was buying the XBC dip and staking like a madman from my laptop loving the 20% staking Rewards and having a sensible chuckle at deluded linkies
Nah, I bought the 1800 dip and feel comfy so far.
Would have sold on ath and picked up that much more at 0.20
Buying now is comfy, but some fuckers bought at 51c and watched it drop all the way.
Fkn linkies.
Sell at 10K and buy back in at 1800.
I have no other regrets.
I still think it's going to the moon but now I have 1/5th of what I could have.
That was harsh.
I also had some losses there, but I sold early and waited some weeks until the downtrend was broken.
Then I scooped up 51k in the price range of 1800-1900.
Nope, I have gains from other coins.
I'm either along for the ride straight into the ground or I'm buying a fucking ChainLink lambo.
I would have sold at 0.5 and bought bitcoin,then i would have sold my bitcoin today and bought back in.
I could probably have trippled my LINK holdings if i had done that..
I made +450% thanks to this coin.
