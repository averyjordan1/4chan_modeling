Why aren't you buying the dip?Ardor is like eth/neo except without gas.It makes these worthless dapps you love actually useful to normies
i bought some at 11 cents but sold it at like 17 or something, i should get more its an undervalued lesser known cc that is super cheap rn you cant really go wrong, then again, you could buy LINK for about the same price, probably best to have some of each
