You've got to be comfy af.
I missed 0.0029 yesterday due to transaction confrimations.
Not really, I don't get "comfy" with coins, I buy and flip them for quick but big profits.
comfyAt least for the following few days.
Not much is gonna go wrong for you.
Market cap is insanely low considering what we've seen from other dex coins that are far away from releasing a product.
Not only does this coin have the dex angle, but with derivatives included which is huge.
Also the whole VC aspect gives DCORP a little bonus over the other dex coins.This has potential to be a $500 million market cap within 365 days, as long as they can deliver a quality product.
Finally someone with brains.
4chan get in now or cry.
