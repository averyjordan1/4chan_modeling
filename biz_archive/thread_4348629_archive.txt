Bought Astro on etherdelta at 0.0067 and it crashed to 0.004 and currently its at 0.0047, its been staying out around this range for a few days now but the thing is it gets its official listing on etherdelta on the 15th this month so it MIGHT go up again.Do I sell or not?
Reason I'm thinking about selling is because I'm afraid I will miss out on moon missions, if I sell I could probably make back what I lost but knowing my luck if I sell it would probably moon anyway.Wut do?
bump help u faggots
dude the shit was like .003 at ico price why are you panicking?
after they burnt the rest of the tokens this shit will moon for sure.
just chill brainlet
