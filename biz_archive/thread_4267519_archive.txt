I'd like price predictions for MONEROBATLINKSTORJARK But mainly Monero what is its future
$250 eoy easy.
year prediction?
Pic related is an estimation of monero's inflation rate.
It's going to be significantly lower than Bitcoin's during those 5 years.
Monero's fungibility makes it a great store of wealth, and more DNMs are going to adopt it soon too; it is going to be the main currency for DNMs.
Monero doesn't have any problem with forks or a split community.I think (assuming crypto doesn't get fucked) that $10k in 5 years is a very modest estimation, almost too low.
All I can say is that it's going to make great gains, but it all depends on how well crypto in general does.
time for another BAT pump
does this mean monero gets a flat inflation near 2022 or the chart is goofy and makes it look like a straight line?also, wasen't the last "ladder" of bitcoin's inflation this year and not lasts?TL;DR, what's the source for this?
Monero at least 200 eoy, probly 250
4269547It's not a straight line, it just looks like it.
(Look at LTC)The block reward is going to be fixed at 0.6 XMR around 2022.
So the amount of coins mined per year stays the same, but the inflation rate (very) slowly converges to 0.
Those are great coins with the exception of BAT and Link
