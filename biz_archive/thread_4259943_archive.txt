I have 20k REQ, 3.5k COSS, and 5k LINK as of now.
Trying to scalp my way to 10k LINK, 50 LINK a day for a 100 days basically.
I started 3k LINK.
Is that enough to make it?
I just need 300k USD to make it in my shitty country.
I'm not expecting anything out of COSS, only REQ and LINK is giving me hope.
Fuck I hope LINK goes $20 each, REQ $5.
I run out of money in 3 years and 5 months.
I don't want to touch my savings anymore, too risky.
If LINK and REQ doesn't reach those numbers I'm gonna kill myself.
I don't wanna go back to working guys :(
make it 50k REQ and 15k LINK and youll make it
chainlink is trash
Sounds like you're gonna make it mein nigger
