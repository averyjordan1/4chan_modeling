Can someone explain to me why anyone even cares about blockchain tech when there is DAG tech.Is 2018 going to be IOTAs year?
Yes.
It will be listed on Bittrex after POWR and MERPic related: Richie is the guy who runs bittrex
The IOTA Foundation took balances into custody over the last months, mine including, hence why there's a reclaim tool.
I still don't have my balance back and I haven't seen it in months.
tfw 60% IOTA portfolio
Everything else but BTC will die in the long run.
Alt-Coins are the biggest waste ever.
BTC will dominate in a few years and habe every problem they have now solved
If they could make a fucking wallet that worked it would be a start.
Balance 0 what a fucking joke.
No.
Centralised garbageBtw.
One of the next coins on trex will be NSR.

Store of value is the only thing that matters in crypto
