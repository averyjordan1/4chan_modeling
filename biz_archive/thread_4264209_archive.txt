I'm new to all of this entirely, how do I get into crypto currencies?
I have around $1200 AUD right now I want to invest until I go on holiday in February, I'm not expecting to make an exorbitant ammount of money, but I was hoping to maybe make another $100-$300.I was thinking of investing in some alt coins like ARK, Is it possible to just buy a bunch now and sit on them or will I run into fee's and other bullshit, and how do I go about actually purchasing/selling coins?
Any tips or advice would be handy.
put all of it into link
Don't listen to this man.
Link is a solid project but won't do much for another year (but when it does it'll moon).ETP or WTC.
All into POSW.
Releasing updates through till December.
Links dead.
You might make a bit of money if you bought it and waited a year, but you could be looking at at least 300% returns with POSW in the coming weeks.

do this and you'll make 2-5x by Feburary... way to over your budget of $100-300

go read up on POWR, a very successful Aussie coin so far.

Nigga it's called google.
Buy bitcoin, send to an exchange, exchange for those coins.Considering you're an ausfag, a good place to buy btc is btcmarkets or localbitcoins usually.
Don't buy from coinspot
Also don't listen to  you most definitely will not 2-5x by Feb. LINK is good but not when you wanna fuck off on a contiki in Feb and need the money for then.
buy only bitcoin and nothing else.
you are not ready for altcoins
Tbh it sounds like he's not even ready for BTC.
He doesn't deserve to profit.
