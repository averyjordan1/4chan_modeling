Want to buy more ETH, which is undervalued at this point, but not sure if whole market is about to get JUSTed by tether bitfinex scam.
Should I wait?
I still have my eyes on re entering at 305
I cashed out because of the Tether situation months ago, then rebought at the dip to 3kâ€¦I guess it still might blow up at any time; but when?
Wait for what?If you act like this you'll wait your whole life for a series of things.
Just be aware of the risk and act.
How about holding 40-50% cash so you can act if something happens?
