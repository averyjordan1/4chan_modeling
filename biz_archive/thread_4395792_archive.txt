AAAAAAAAAAAAA
just what a sham market--- ripple surges for literally no reason on the 3rd to 4016.
Then the rumors that have been speculated for months turn out to be true and ripple can't even breach 4000 lmao talk about rigged to perfection
Jesus christ, it's only been 6 hours lads, relax.
Wait until Korea/Japan wake up in 6 hours
It better go back up when I get home from wagecucking up put 90 in it in order to make some quick funds to buy more LINK
>chasing candles>buying ripple above $.25 everThe fuck did you expect?
This.
You're supposed to buy when it's going down, not up.
If you buy when it's high then you need to just stop trading right now because you are literally too stupid and will never make it.
You can only lose money if you sell for a loss.
So, basically you FOMO'd and since you didn't make an instant profit you sold for a loss?You're a retard, that's what you are.
Guys can someone tell me wtf happened with Ripple today?
I had a sell order at 0.00085 ETH which went through but I have no idea why there was a pump.I thought the sell order might go through in like a month at least.
