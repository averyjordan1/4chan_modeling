Not too late to get in still.
10%= parabolic
I hate those sell walls though.
Time to tear them down.
it might go up a bit but remember to sell quickly when the miner oligarchy stops hashing for the bitcoin chain because BCH is going to rocket and BTC is going to freefall then.
Bought in early at $2.50.
Feels good to almost double my stack in under a week.
NoSalts are clueless.
This shit will hit $10 in the coming weeks.
What makes you say that?
58200 is where it will dip.
If my math is correct.
It's a really good coin and it will hit 20USD at minimum within a few weeks, but there are more pressing matters that divert attention from it.
Namely, BTC vs BCH.
Alts need to step aside and wait for a while.
I bought a lot of salt, it was 2/5 of my portfolio, but I sold at 4USD to buy BCH at 750USD.
BCH will go parabolic and salt will drop down towards ~3.5USD area.
I expect steady rising until people realize just how much of a clusterfuck the BCH vs BTC war is going to be.
Just wait 'til the chinese wake up.
58200newfag here, 58200 what?
They said big news is coming this week, so probably tomorrow.
Also product is launching December, they have confirmed.
I wasn't that clear, I think SALT will rise a bit more before BCH shoots up further so don't dump yet.
But be ready.
buying at ATH
Platform launch will present the opportunity to spread the FOMO of 1 SALT = $25 (granted the value of the coin depends upon the success of the platform) but it'll be SO easy to spread around the fact that SALT is worth that $25 on the platform but "only trading for $5 on exchanges."

I'm changing the dip to 49, 750 sats.
Flash dump style.
