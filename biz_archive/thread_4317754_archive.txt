BCC IS DIPPING?
IM SURE IT WILL CONTINUE TO RAI----AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
give it 1 hourroger will take care of it
will be back in an hour
This is literally the calm before the storm.Wait until Roger dumps all his BTC and the Koreans are back at it again.Don't sell now.
Don't sell at loss.
That's the best advice I can give you anon.
Pretty much this.
Hold, there's no way BCC is going down longterm.
At the moment it looks like BCH is absolutely railed.
Guys you need to buy Bitcoin cash now, you can still get like 4 bitcoins for your old CoreSegwitJewCoin if you catch my drift.
Please, I went in all on 0.26 and belive in the floppening, thanks for showing me the light biz it really made me think and even the logo is green so it can only go up.
Just get some Bitcoin cash guys you got the pole position in buying it before the "normies" have to get in at a 2:1 ratio, yes 2:1 you will see so if you wanna be rich get in now
nice copypasta
We need to talk.
