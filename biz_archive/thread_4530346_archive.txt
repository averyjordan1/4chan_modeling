who else cant sleep well when they are keeping coins in an exchange?
does not feel safe at all.
I dont know how people can do it.
I haven't had a good night sleep since I started.
I've also gained 20 lbs and have random chest pains
Heart attack incoming
I have 40 BTC on Bittrex and 15 on Polo.
No fucks given
major exchanges are more secure than most wallets which are poorly coded to begin with
I have withdrawn all my funds ($800 btw) to my wallet.I cant sleep either as now I cant sell the highs and buy the dips easily.
dont get why people are this paranoid.If exchanges make commission from trading, theyre probably interested in keeping their customers and getting new ones so they trade on their platform and thus making them money.so tell me why the fuck an exchange like binance is going to steal your coins when they fucking make a shitton on commission in the first place.
why would they steal from the hand that feeds?
