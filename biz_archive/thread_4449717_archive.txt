I had about a dozen bitcoins in an online wallet in about 2010, how should I find them?
Check your email, try to find old emails related to this.
Which online wallet?
Vast majority of crypto services existing in 2010 aren't here anymore.
Is it MtGox?

Also I just opened the Bitcoin client for the first time since then, how long will it take the blocks to update?

What litecoin pools were big back around 2014 or so?
I remember mining some, but never cashed out.
you have to change threshold to withdraw, change it to like 0.01 BTC and it will withdraw automatically to your new adress if you set one.
