Okay biz, I know this has been said before but I would like to give it yet another try.Can we have a normal, non shilling or fudding, discussion about Loopring $LRC?
I found a bunch of articles praising it, here are two:>https://medium.com/@joeykeeton/the-new-trading-economy-of-loopring-60eaeed77610>https://medium.com/@rackytwo/loopring-is-the-hidden-gem-amidst-the-neo-news-b1969de76c7eReddit is also overall extremely positive.My question to you all is:1) What do you think about LRC and why?2) Should people go all in on this one?
Yes, no, why so?
this is going down before it goes up
The BTC push is not helping any alt atm I must admit
also the news was shit and you'd be lucky if the bittrex listing took you back to 2500 let alone 3000+
I think it is a solid investment for future returns, but you're not looking at any major gains in the NEAR future unless it does get listed to Bittrex.
Then it'll do the typical pump and dump, then slowly rise again to new ATH's.
Never go all-in on a coin no matter how confident you are in it, because anything can happen.
They could come out tomorrow and say that shit isn't what they wanted and they'll drop the project to work on NEX only or something, IDK.
LRC is my #1 investment and it is only ~20% of my total portfolio.
Diversify helps soothe the pain if you get fucked by a failed project or a scam (see Confidio).
Yeah I really had the idea that the news would push the price to higher levels.
Too bad the integration of LRC protocol into NEX is not gonna happen.
It will happen, just not right away.
LRC is nothing to NEX at this point in time, but it will be the gateway from NEX to ETH in the future.
True true.
It's just that my portfolio is currently around $130K and I would like to turn it in 1M next year.Idk I just feel like I should take on some more risk.
