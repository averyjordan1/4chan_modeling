why is BTC going up
Bitcoins does whatever bitcoin wants.
Don't try to understand it.
all uncertainty around the fork has left the market, btc remains the core chain.
People invested in it, why would it dump outside of the initial noob panic on news release?
the good thing is alts are back in the game now
