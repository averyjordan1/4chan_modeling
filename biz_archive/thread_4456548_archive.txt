Everytime I try to sell on Bittrex new sell orders exactly lower then mine immediately pops up.I keep doing this for minutes and even significantly decrease my sell order everytime BOOM seconds after new sell orders exactly lower then mine.Fucking bots?
No matter how low I decrease the selling price
Anybody any perspective?
Not happening to me, have you tried to use the immediate or cancel feature when selling?
bittrex is the only exchange I always have a problem with selling, I have to wait a ton everytime.
Any other exchange and it goes by fast.
Nice quads.
90% of the action is bots trying to trick the 10% of manual buyers and sellers into making emotional decisions, once you realize this you will have a much easier time
Happens on other exchanges too.
It's the bots.
Really evident on binance
Couldn't you tank the price theoretically?
Gaming the fucking bots
Yes, when I see the price going down I cancel and then set the price way lower.
Happens again and again.
yup, just another day playing their game
market making bots buy and sell within ranges so they will only go to predetermined points but if you focused your effort across multiple exchanges you may be able to make a dent.
typically you're just tightening a spread that was initially more than enough for them to make a healthy profit on in the first place.
Alright thanks
