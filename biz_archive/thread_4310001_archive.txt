What's the safest coin to put my e-shekels in to weather this storm?
ETH?
USDT?
ALL IN BCH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
ETHUSDT lmao it's not even backed by anything.
LINK
HShare seems a stable bet, has barely moved these last few 'fork' months.
Rank 21 marketcap too.
Probably USDTTell me one cryto that is backed by anything besides that one from Burger King Russia that's backed by a hamburger lmao
eth or ltc
yeah since ETH gets manipulated daily to stay at 300, it's honestly a better 'port in a storm' than USDT which could evaporate at any moment.
XBC is doing amazing One million total supply
