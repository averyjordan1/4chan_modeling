Guys I have been waiting for this Doge to drop to 1 Satoshi as I have ton of limit orders to buy it cheap.
Is this thing ever going to drop?
If not why won't it?
as I thought it was just a meme coin.
It's a meme coin, but it's an old meme coin
Dogecoiners are moving to Chancoin.
1 doge coin will always equal 1 doge coin.
that is all that matters
ChancoinStill too expensive.
memes never die
