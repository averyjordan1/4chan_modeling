Hey /biz/ do you draw your wedge and pennant meme triangles from the candles body or from the wick?Im a retard trader but meme-triangles are one of the most reliable ways of making decisions - absolutely retard-proof......
no comments on a technicaly relevant issue....so /biz/like
i use whichever one fits better... if you use the candles and not the wicks and then switch to 1minute candles usually they spill way over the meme lines though.
you should ask how much of a difference it makes.if the difference is so big that you are stumped about the pattern then maybe you just fucked up
 triangles.
