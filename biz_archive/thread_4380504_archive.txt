Got in at 80k sats, not disappointed at all.
Thinking of hopping off at 200k.
Any idea when?
Yep im planning to switch to Link and repeat the cycle
I bought at ICO and have 120,000 Lisk.
Many of my peers in Lisk sold at $1.
I just turned crypto off from my mind.
You have got to detach from all feelings.
