Has /biz/ ever been good to you?
Told me about DNA, happy to be holding those bags over the next month
Of course Biz has been the bestest estest everestest
They told me about ETH and Ark.Turned my $1500 into $100,000 in a year.
When did you get in on ARK?
Right now it's doing nothing.I went in on XMR at $140 thanks to the many shilling threads.
Definitely happy about those gains.
Same here
I remember in the pre-crypto days when I was in HS /biz/ showed me a website full of pajeets where you could write blog posts and got 1 cent for every open/like and comment.
Netted me some 300-400$ each month working from home after classes so that was nice kys
I own my store to /biz/An anon lent me the money i needed to open my store.
I sold XMR at $7 and i had like 30 of them.REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's the only place where I find Pepe and Wojack actually funny for some reason
