Korea just bought so much Dash so quickly they shot the price up to $964 (from $350) in less than 15 minutes.Korean "investors" are the biggest idiots.
Dash is the real bitcoin.
DASH embodies Satoshi's True vision of a centralized shitcoin
why though, why would you pump dash like that?
looks like dash just made a DASH UP
Amazing times!
Korea is going through all the major coins and just pumping them.
If you don't know what a "major" coin is, anything on Polo with a USDT pair is a good start.
Jesus I have godly luck today, sold BCH at $2400 and put half of it in dash half in monero, then this happens.
so next is Zcash or Monero?
