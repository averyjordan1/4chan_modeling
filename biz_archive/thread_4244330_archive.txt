I was wondering if theres programs that could detect key words (bitcoin) in news articles that are receiving high volumes of traffic on the internet.
obviously theres a trend with the value in bitcoin and the the media attention it gets so maybe if you knew a news article was gonna blow up you could buy before all the norms get there.
sorry if this is a fucking dumb idea i have little knowledge in trading but I'm slowly learning.
All you have to do is watch for "Oldfagbiztard" posts.
Why would you need a program?
Just type bitcoin on google news and bookmark that shit
This.
Oldfagbiztard is an Intelligence Asset that has proved repeatedly he knows whats up before anyone else.
He appears to be a real life Reddington from Blacklist.
