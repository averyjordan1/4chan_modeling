Who a confy ReQ holder here ;3
not yet, i'll buy some after the fork
Fiat is ready for the pre fork dumb :)
4246559I already have my share now I just have to wait for a few months.
Also bought some 0x and ETH since it's going to be using those.
i'm waiting for the fork because i'm already holding btc.
i may as well wait a week to get them /free coins/.
i'll definitely buy some req after though because i think it has high potential.
Req is on the list of coins I'm dumping my box stack into after the forkHopefully it says below 40m
 Not holdingi'm sorry for your loss
no cunt im not comfy, i bought in during the ico :(

4246629hmm yeah I actually lost a lot of profits buy selling out during drops.
I would have had more money if I just held through the drops.
Ah well.Lessons have been learned.
k reporting in - wish it was more but that's what happens when you buy 100k during the ICO.
Nothing left to average down with.
meh holding just a bit over 100k 10x would be nice but who knows how long and if that even happens
Bought 40k during ICO, 10k between .00012-15eth.Should I buy now or wait?
Buy high sell low, you did well anon...
Wish I bought some a week ago when it was at its lowest, would improve my average cost.
30$ is 8k$I mean I get his logic but that's a really bad comparison.
projecting this hard.
My last trades have been profitable so theres that.Only been in the game for 3 monthsI bought REQ bags from 477 up to 800 sats.Don't think I did a bad deal.
I hope we dont get all the pajeets back into this coin with all the shilling on biz.It would probably be better for the coin if we stopped posting about it.
Nah It's going to be fine from now.
I think ...
Yeh, bitdice actually performed way better when there were no 4chan posts
