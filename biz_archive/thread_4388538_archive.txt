What's with these alternating buy/sell walls on BTC?
Are the Chinese manipulating the market at the moment?
My, would you look at the time.
whales spoofing the market in both direction: set buy wall and push the market up into the whales sell orders than put up a sell wall to push the price down into buy orders and then repeat until the whale is done feeding.
Is there even any money to be made by buying at 7225 and selling at 7250?
That's 0.3% gains - i'm pretty sure gdax will take 0.25% or something too.
maker fees are 0 on gdax so it's still profitable to do
It doesn't even matter because 99% of the time the wall never gets touched.
Buy, sell, spin around it doesn't matter because they have full control of your psychology.
The wall is not meant to be touched.
The whale sets small sell order(s) a couple dollars away.
He then puts up a buy wall.
Those who want to get executed now naturally jump in front of the buy wall pushing into his sells.
He then does the reverse to close the trade.
