Assuming BCC takes over BTC, what does this mean for altcoins?
Means the market is kill desu
Hopefully a bull run.
Profit taking from bch and the more ideologically inclined investors won't want to put it into btc
total destruction to pre 2011 level within 12 months.
BCH is going back up now and will disrupt BTC through the weekend
Markets will open up for bch
Look again, friend
this, alt coins only got market share because btc was crippled
It really won't...
It's over...
Enjoy the bags anon...
So how likely are exchanges to open up BCC pairs in the near future?
