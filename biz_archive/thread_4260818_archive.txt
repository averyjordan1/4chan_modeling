Why the fuck is Noone talking about Raiden network?
It's a direct platform upgrade for ethereum.It's the lightning transaction for ETH and allows off chain payment settlement.
You bizcucks are going in projects with no whitepaper or website or team.
Ridiculous.
It's sitting at a measly 50M market cap, test net is out, main net about to launch.
The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution for performing ERC20-compliant token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.
It is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling near-instant, low-fee, scalable, and privacy-preserving payments.The Raiden Network allows secure transfers of tokens between participants without the need for global consensus.
This is achieved using digitally signed andhash-lockedtransfers, calledbalance proofs, fully collateralized by previously setup on-chain deposits.https://raiden.network
We only care about pajeet coins here.
shitcoin
it has it's own token, vitalik doesn't agree with it, and so he's funding a competitor directly, which will obviously end up being the one that gets mainstream usage.
Btw anyone wanting to go in on this do note that this is not a longhodl coin as raiden will be absolutely demolished by less jewish general state channel projects.
There's stuff like plasma coming out.
Fucc this useless ICO shit Vita1337 was right, devs of this are greedy fucks.Might be a good pump and dump though if it gets hype.
: Plasma and Raiden are complementary.
2: State channel project has just been announced whereas uRaiden is going to be able to realize use on the mainnet in a month.3: For all we know Raiden may be looking to develop state channels in the future.
1 million transactions per second, this is still a legit product.
it was hyped back in the day but the eth foundation is probably better at scaling now 2bh.
we still got time before we really need a visa-tier scaling solution.
The raiden network is very promising but th token itself is useless.
