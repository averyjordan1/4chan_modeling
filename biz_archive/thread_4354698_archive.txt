Etheruem, light of my life, fire of my loins.
My sin, my soul.
Eth-ee-ree-um: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth.
Eth.
eer.
ree.

She was Eth, plain Eth, in the morning, standing four Green Candles in one sock.
She was Etty in slacks.
She was Reeba at school.
She was Sunny on the dotted line.
But in my arms she was always Ethereum.
Did she have a precursor?
She did, indeed she did.
Without bitcoin, there might not be an Etherum at all had I not loved, one summer, an initial child coin.
In a princedom by the sea.
Oh when?
About as many years before Etherum was born as my age was that summer.
