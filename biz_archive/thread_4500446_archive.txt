I have been seeing a lot of posts about GVT.
I see Charlie Shrem is advising.
It seems a bit pumped do you think the price will dip?
Terrible idea.
shut ur mouth boiii and get some gvt
Price will go to 20$
considering that they were listed in 4 exchanges within 24 hrs of ico...theres bittrex rumors due to the CEO of Changelly as an adviser and Charlie Sherm as well.$12 mil mcap is still fairly low but if there is a dip...buy in asap.
I'm not sure if there will be tho
It will dip, everything does, but not now as it's gaining traction.
Once volume picks up it will spike hard
