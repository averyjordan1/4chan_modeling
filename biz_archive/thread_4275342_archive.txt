What alarm or monitoring systems do you use?
On pc or Phone?
I want to start running the way I trade off alarms.
use pissbottles and shitbowls, never miss a moon ever again.

I want something that blasts full volume no matter what and never fails.
I want it to go full volume until I shut it off.
Buy laptop fool, take shit while trading....

This can't happen again.
