The NEX whitepaper release today revealed to the world the bumbling imbeciles that run this scam.
Price has already fallen.
Once it breaks through the 2200 resistance the panic will set in and sell offs will begin en masse.
Once it shoots through the $0.15 mark, unabated PANIC will rip through all LOOPIES.
With all those who dumped at 3100 laughing hysterically as they refresh binance.The $0.06 mark will be met, the largest sell in history will ensue.
The vaporware project will eventually be revealed to not even be utilized on NEON exchange, and wagecuckers with their engineering salaries loaded up in LRC will enter true terror en masse, dumping their massive stacks for a some chance at at a return.The price WILL dump at this point to below $0.01, and most probably reach confido levels.From that day forward the deluded Loopie wagecucking engineering nerds who bought this coin thinking it had fundamentals will go back to their jobs, slaving away day after day leading depressing and unfulfilling lives.Ecstatic Loopies will hold bags FOREVER, with no income, no hope, and no chance of ever recovering.I warned you Loopies.
There's still time to get out.
Sell NOW.Don't be deluded, don't be a Loopie.
