Request Network is literally a ticking timebomb ready to explode.
*Backed by the #1 accelerator in Silicon Valley: Y-Combinator, (same company that brought us Reddit, these guys are legit so Request is obviously not a scam coin)*Competent and Transparent Team, with already has 3 years experience in Fintech domain with another successful startup(Moneytis)*Beta release is due probably next month.
News coming Friday*Still below ico price*Medium level Market Cap of 30 mil.
*Poised to cause disruption in B2B transactions, Auditing, Peer to Peer Payments, etc.It had the worst possible timing of an ICO this year, releasing between BTC Gold and B2X, so it never got a fair shot.
But this is a golden opportunity for investors to get in that missed the ICO.
