I sold my ETP for $2.8 and now it is going to list on a chinese exchange.. should i buy back??
advice pls
> buy high sell lowThis board is full of idiots
lol why'd you sell...didnt you notice that Binance didnt list MOD and ETP on the voting ballot when they were both very "hot"?MOD was added right away because its an easy ERC 20 token.I am pretty confident ETP will be on there soon as well.
exactly this erc20 is simple to addown blockchains take a little more work thus etp wasn't listed at the same timewhy would you sell for 2.8 wtf
Just why... ETP will be atleast 10x in 2018, by the end of 2018 its probably 50x
buy high sell lowOP is virgin trader
May I ask why?
Never heard of it before and thinking of investing.
Buy $NULS like a fucking chad or listen to other people and miss another moon mission.
Buy EDO op don't listen to anyone else trying to get you to buy their bags
Bro this team is realistic and the real deal, when they say something they do it right away.
