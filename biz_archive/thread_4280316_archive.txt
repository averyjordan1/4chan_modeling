Take your computer downstairs to the bad place with no windows where mommy takes you when you're short on GBPs.
myetherwallet and just copy paste your private key when you wanna deposit or send coins
Binance almost definitely won't gox you.But if you're worried about that you can use myetherwallet.

I use a Trezor (works with MEW) to store my long term crypto.
