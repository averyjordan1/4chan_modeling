Anyone here a Credit Analyst or know about the position?
I want to know if it's a career worth pursuing and what it takes to become one.
I have a Bachelors degree in Finance, but currently work a dead end job that is essentially repetitive data entry.
hey anonCFA hereCredit analyst jobs will be obsolete in the foreseeable future as banks move converge towards fintech in consumer credit and business banking.
I would learn some coding that is relevant to fintech and try to make it in that industry because legacy finance is dying a slow death.
I used to work abroad in corporate finance.
I moved back to the US but haven't applied for any jobs yet.
burning through my savings right now.
Thanks for the input.
you're probably right.
