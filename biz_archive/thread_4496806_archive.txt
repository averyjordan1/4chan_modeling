Who else pumped up about BCH?
It looks better and better each day as it keeps holding its 1200 position despite all the FUD, Tether tantrums, Buttcoin rallies and other ridiculousness.Moonboom imminent.
Pathetic
I'm all into BCH right now.
This isn't because I believe BCH is superior to BTC though.
The big players in this space want to make money...
I will not be caught on the other side of their moves.
I'm not idealistic.
