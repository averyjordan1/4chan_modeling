k for Tiffany engagement ring, 18k for 2013 bmw 335i, the rest loss in stock market doing penny stocks.
My car probably worth 30k only.Got kid coming next spring.
Sadly I fucked that up and didn't learn until 2 days after I moved my BTC into Coinbase from my cold storage, I learn quick, but was looking to cash out 2 really fast.
:/ I know it was a $5,000+ lesson but in my mind I try to look at the fact that it was a $30,000+ gain for a few bucks I had from trying to buy Shrooms online but got to scared to ages ago.
pretty gud i would say.
i hope you hodl link

So how did the split work exactly?
Trying to understand how you missed out since I'm not too familiar with it.
good plan
k for the Tiffany ring.
It was either that or she go for abortion with my son.
How long after graduating and not finding a job does your degree basically become useless?I graduated 6 months ago now and haventy found any work, and am getting worried that soon enough I will have been out of the field for me to be considered.
I've been thinking about going to grad school just to fill the gap
when I made the first Transaction they treated as two transactions - you had to move the BCH out of X wallet first (I Believe)I didn't realize I had BCH I had a wallet on my old Macbook computer (Thankfully still worked even though my kid was using it watch cartoons and shit) I never even saw the BCH in the wallet, but I didnt' look either, just went straight to BTC and moved to Coinbase to cash out.
You deserve everything bad happening to you, and more.
Holy shit.
What did you do at the wedding?
I can totally 100% imagine myself doing stuff like that.
I had an alcohol psychosis four times now due to extreme intoxication.
In case you don't now what that is: in my case I start hallucinating bad, change into a completely different person and just literally get a psychosis (insanity attack).
Not pretty.
Actually got a Chinese wife, those fking hitches won't demand anything less than a Tiffany ring.
abortion was the right call you idiotnow you have a son with a diseased gene pool.retard.
virgin, never had a gf>Slave in crypto>live with parents>NEET college dropout>ugly manlet
Do you know any Dutch people in NY?
If you don't provide another tiffany ring at least every year (or something equal) you'll never see your child again.
That's a promise.
well thats a nice collection of fuckups op but atleast you're still 20. abort the kid and you'll still have a chance.
srs
I called her a whore and tacjled the groom on the dance floor until a few guys pulled me off and threw me out.
Good thing my wife has that corrupt Chinese money.
Her condo is paid off.
Her grand parents is gov official.
Her parents house in Beijing worth a few million or more.
Her bank account has 50k cash.
I have a good job.
But still fk.
I got to be a man and get rid of this debt I incurred.
guide me in CPA please.
it is my last chance.

Your dog would get depressed without exercise as well.
Most introverts need to exercise because we are just sitting on a computer all day and our emotions fluctuate hard, whereas regular exercise keeps you mentally strong.

Read Schopenhauer.
It will make you feel better.
Money is the difference between happiness and misery.
The only time money does not equate to happiness, is when you didn't have it when you needed it.
Then it becomes useless.

I litterally get in the shuttle and get off for some reason.
I have a feeling that i am self sabotaging myself.
Something in me doesn't want to be successful and wants to remain a loser neet living with my parents.
Honestly, I don't even think about it because I know that it will make me emotionally unstable so I just keep moving on.
Been doing this for 3 months or so.
i also have tinnitus.
it's not so bad for me since i play a lot of vidya with headphones on and sleep with a boxfan next to me, i didn't know that it gets worse over time tho fuggg

You are very clearly self-sabotaging.
Fuck sake, literlly just buying and holding a top-10 coin would be better than what you are doing.
It doesn't have to though.
Could take decades.
But mine probably will get worse because I have the correct symptoms let's put it like that.
I divorced her.

I'm hoping to transfer to a different 4 year school and put all of my aid money into crypto.
How do I help myself ?
This is my current portfolio.
If I don't reach 100k by the end of 2018 I will simply off myself.
My parents already hate me and staying in the same house might literally give me cancer it's so filled with negativity; I think this is also the reason I self sabotage; I never really believed that crypto could help me change my life and every-time I get close I freak the fuck out; I am not even afraid of losses and can deal with holding a losing position.
However, it could also be random because I have no real system and make trades with YOLO mentality.

this is shit adive though, we both know that the crypto market is too volatile for that and I also want to learn to make trades instead of being a passive no risk faggot.
can you elaborate on what you mean?
i would like to know if i also have those symptoms.
unless you're referring to outside stimuli.
i also have static vision which apparently comes in tandem with tinnitus.
do you have that as well?
you are literally retarded.On the year long scale, the crypto market isn't volatile at all.
If you sit on your ass, you are virtually guaranteed to make very solid gains, assuming you invest in a solid, top-10 coin.Where real volatility enters is when you start doing exactly what your dumb ass is doing, which is trying to day trade.Your results speak for themselves, dude.
Keep trying to do what you're doing, I dare you, I double dog dare you motherfucker.
Anon, why did you put dick in crazy?
Disappoint.
My parents are very traditional.
I've had my gf spend the night a few times in the past because of leaving for trips early in the morning and what not.
My parents make her sleep in the guest room.
Yeah are you fucking new or stupid?
Nearly every altcoin is halved in satoshi value.
Holding a shitcoin means you are assuming it will beat bitcoins performance.
Look at what happened to those that held the past 6 months
how do you college without a high school diploma
That's why I said top-10 faggot.
Can you read?
Are ETH and XMR shitcoins?
Or have they gone up massively and predictably in value?
4363747If I were to do that 6 months back it would have been profitable.
However, doing that any time in the past 3 months would have been terrible in most cases and you would have halved your initial investment.
Also, I haven't lost significantly in trades but my overall performance has been sub par.
If weren't trading I wouldn't have missed these opportunities because there weren't any opportunities to miss.
Get it ?
dummy
im sorry to hear that :(
That's why I said to fucking hold on to it for a year or more, retard.If this is a hard concept for you to grasp than obviously crypto just isn't for you.
thanks but no.
I would rather keep fucking up and learn than sit back and go to sleep with a good chance that my coin would have forked and now ETHCASH is the KING.
you realize that you would then own said ETHCASH, right?Probably not.
Good luck continuing to do what you've been completely failing at.
43603324361013humble bragging in a JUST thread>JUSTFeeling like your life is mediocre is the worst.
My mom said some time ago that "it's sad to realize you had a mediocre life" and that really struck a cord with me, though I actually do nothing to avoid this path.
Yeah, I have floaters in my eyes but highly doubt that is a product of tinnitus.
Maybe it is stress related though.I have high pitched (18 kHz) bilateral tinnitus.
The high pitch makes it always audible I cannot supress it.
Even at a concert I can still hear my tinnitus because it respons to sound becoming worse in loud environments.
I can manipulate it by moving my jaw or my neck etc.
Because it is extremely highly pitched it will probably get worse, in the sense that extra noises will be added, because the higher pitched regions of my hearing will fail eventually causing "extra" tinnitus.Furthermore, it constantly fluctuates, bad and good days, which is also a symptom that eventually one of the bad days simply sticks.
Also, it started as unilateral, became bilateral later and now I hear it in the center of my head.
In short, it is spreading throughout my head, another symptom of worsening.

spend some time traveling and hiking after school.even if it's not a severe case, cancer is some heavy shit.you have plenty of money, I'd suggest putting a fair amount into some safe bets, maybe a mutual fund, you don;t need a big emergency fund at this point in your life.depending on what you're into, try some psychedelics, and go exploring, get outdoors, take some risks, and get new experiences.figure out how long you'll do this for so you have a definite end point and don't start drifting, come back home, reconnect with senpai, and then try to find a [professional direction that lines up with how you want to live your life, try to sort out your priorities and a few goals in life while traveling.
meeting new people experiencing new ways of life should help with that.
try to spend time with good people, and see if you can pick up on what they've got going on that gives them purpose and meaning in life

It's the worst.
What's worse is if you're not black, you don't really have anyone in your social circle to relate to.You don't develop as fast as everyone else because you can't emulate a man's behavior.
I didn't fee fully developed until I was 25.Also, your friend's fathers holding you at arms length since they don't want things to get twisted, fucks up your relationship with other men and authority figures.
Things will click for you.

Look at myself in the mirror every day with disgust.
>my only sibling died as a young boyI wish I had a pepe to post but I deleted all my reaction images in an attempt to quit 4chan.
Obviously it didn't work.
Are you talking about the same thing as this?
How is this kind of job?
How often will I be around the doctors and nurses?

most devs are very bad, as soon as you start getting really invested in learning programming you'll quickly be way better than the norm (protip: don't spend too much time on OO, focus on FP).work hard at your first job to build a narrative of young genius around you, then learn some negotation skills to make yourself appear even better, and slowly climb up.oh and don't join too big a company at first

Everyone always talks about Java n shit.What do you think of trying to specialize in something like solidity?
Smart contracts are likely to really take off and there will be a huge gap in the market for smart contract programmers at some point.
