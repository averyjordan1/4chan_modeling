Anything on r/btc is pure bcash propaganda.Anything on r/bitcoin is pure bitcoin propaganda Lots of people don’t know that and end up on one of the subreddits and get a completely one sided view on everything.Make your own mind up and don’t listen to dumb fucking rdditors
I bought bch because I like it more than btc, I believe it in as a coin much more than coreshit.
My condolences then anon, you’ll learn a lesson not to trade with your emotions tonight

Resisting chink propaganda = leftism
Everytime I come here I'm like: Guys, can we please tone down the racism, sexism, anti-semitism, homo - and transphobia, xenophobia etc.But this is 4chan, so most people don't tend to listen to reason around here.
*sigh* This is why I mostly use reddit these days.
There the mods actually do something against racism, hare speech and problematic opinions.
Maybe you should just stick to reddit as well until the government has found a way to actually enforce hate speech laws effectively on the internet.
Otherwise you're just fighting an uphill battle against the neverending tide of problematic internet-racists.

What matters is that BCC wont be worth shit soon.
Can't you make a better comeback?
china>patent>exploit>available to all players>segwit>anything to do with blockchains or bitcoin>high fees and transaction times>currency of the future
What subreddit do you visit?
Maybe im just mislead and can become a better person on Reddit.
What matters is that BCC wont be worth shit soon.???

Wow you must be full retard.

ThisRoger ver is the top moderator of r/btc so obviously it's his own personal propaganda toolr/bitcoin has been a core cult for yearsReddit is just a shit website in general.
Information is far too easy to control but it's presented in a such a way that the trends appear to be organic.
They are not.
Every subreddit is a separate echo chamber
it's the same type of people: pro-propaganda, pro-censorship, "sell bch it's going to 0 first day!!!
", believing fake polls and going to r/bitcoin for their opinions
