Sure is comfy sitting back and anticipating the BTC/BCH collapse while still in the green
Are we going to last in the green for long?
Something smells fishy to me.
I'm in the same position.
Just looking from a safe distance, I will not take sides.
alts are denominated in bitcoin.
if bitcoin keeps falling the alts will fall too.
so wtf do I buy then?
Except ETH is very close to being seperate of btc.
I already trade it as it is.
ETH
BCH is denominated in bitcoin and it's doing pretty well right now I'd say.
are you an idiot?
get in bch and make money and then go back to alts
Im the same but having really bad FOMO :(
index funds
Largely all in on monero here, I'm reasonably comfy.
Let the bitcoiners fud each other into the ground
tfw monero>just watching this shitshow from the sideI have no clue if this is going to be the moon mission or the kingda ka drop once it goes into 2k territory.
