Because 92% of tokens got burned after ico, each coin will now earn a much larger share: $0.125 for every $1 million profit made by the crypto hedgefund per quarter.

They are in a mess and they need to sort things out.
They pay dividends fgt

They didn't spend any money on marketing and buyers kept quiet to get larger shares per coin.

So does ARK.
Stay deluded
 →_→ Damn, rekt before we could even buy
Is Ark a crypto hedgefund that pays each token 12.5c for every $1 mill profit per quarter?
Will Ark even make a million in a quarter for that matter?
I just have this to say%
"Link" storefront>The "N" is a chainwhat did they mean by this?
Whitepaper timeline says app release and first dividend next month.How much do we expect their profit to be?
2 mill would get every token $0.12 in ETH payout.
