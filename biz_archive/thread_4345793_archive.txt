Who here wants this mess to kill off both BCH and BTC so we can over time move onto better coins as the defacto crypto of the space?Neither really follows 'Satoshi's vision' anymore and are shit technologically compared to a whole bunch of other coins, so we might as well kill off the dinosaurs and start anew
Me.
Btw nice pic op.After BCH btfos BTC, the psychological game will be completely different and people don't think the biggest can't fail anymore.
The next flippening to an actually useful coin will be much easier.
It will be ethereum and the latest point it will happen is when it launches proof of stake.
DUMB BETCH, BITCOIN WILL NEVER DIE.
ONLY MICROCOIN HAS EFFECTIVELY DIED.
THIS NUGGA STUPID AS SHIT TOILETS AND SHIT TIN FOILETS.
PoW will end us.
Kill off PoW entirely while we're at it.
It's not sustainable
The ADHD-riddled retards here don't have the patience for that.
They just want money now.
They also don't actually care about 'Satoshi's vision' and will just spout it to make their cases seem more legitimate.
Even then, Satoshi doesn't have to have been right about everything
There's gotta be at least a few more of you out there that aren't soul-bound to BTC or BCH
