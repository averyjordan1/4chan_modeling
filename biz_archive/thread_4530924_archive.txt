I'm a retail drone and the company I work for fucked up.
They've failed to pay me.
Twice.
I've contacted my direct supervisor who contacted her direct supervisor - is there even a point in going over their heads and calling up the company itself before I file a complaint with my provincial government?
no point, go straight to the department of labor for your state and they will be fucked, find a new job (one that pays you)
How long you been with them?
Like three weeks, but this is a seasonal three-month gig too so they should really be more on the ball considering they're a pop-up shop.
Labour dept
Happened to me a few years back.Are you in a union?My union pretty much handled everything and I ended up settling out of court for 20x what the store owed me.
Now I'm banned for said store lmao.
why would the fact that they are transient/ethereal possibly mean they should be more on the ball about this type of thing?
if anything, they probably just aren't paying on purpose and will disappear in 3 months...
Never had a unionized job.They're back every year and it's a small town; I could easily track down who owns the place if I felt so inclined.
