What's wrong with staying 100% in BTC right now?
I'm not making money but I'm not losing any either so what's the problem???
It could go down and leave you fucked in the ass
Bitcoin is the only crypto that'll stay around.
All other shitcoin will be worthless in 6 months.
Screen cap this
ETH is about to have a great bullrun.
include me in the screencap saying thisbch will be the real bitcoin
What makes you say that
Give me one fucking good reason
You might have missed the boat to actually make gains that would change your life.
My portfolio is weighted heavily towards bitcoin also, but it's nice to have a few whole coins in another crypto that might go somewhere in the future.
If nothing else, I just won't rely on them and hold them long term.
I'm not making money but I'm not losing any eitherOn that statement, why not just do nothing.
The result would be the same.Ideally, you want your returns to be as high as possible.
I actually have a full BCH
bagholding is not a reason
yes it is
