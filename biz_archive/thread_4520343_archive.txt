The POWR dragon is about to take flight
congratz, youve identified a descending triangle which usually means theres more downsite potential than upside, support at 9k, then 7,5k, then at 6k'ish
Fuck your triangles nigga, you think triangles mean shit to a dragon?
triangles are realistic, dragons not so much
at least hes using rsi like a good boy
Beautiful, OP.
Patterns > indicators such as RSI.
This is a descending triangle and looks like it's going downnnn
Well, it has leveled out for the past few hours and looks like it will head up for another moon mission the same time it did yesterday 4-5 GMT thanks to all the EU ppl getting home from work.But hey, triangles and dragons are cool too.
Oh plus, there are a few POWR threads appearing getting ready to shill for the P&D 'omg POWR is mooooning' threads in a few hours time.
One last P&D before this kitty bounces.
Seriously.
Get in and sell at the new ATH.
You'll be lucky to get in at low 9k.Don't kid yourself.
thanks for poiting that out, however different strategies work for different ppl dont u agree?4521517my rsi suggests that 30min and up timeframes are okay right now, so im not saying youd be dumb to own powr
if you wont pump it my stoploss of 10 btc worth will hit, so you better get to it
