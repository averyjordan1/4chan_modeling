https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-bch.html#3mHash rates have switched to BCH's favor over BTC in just the last day.
Jihan said he would move his mining op.
if more miners made the switch, this may be the case soon.https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions115k Unconfirm transactions and growing everyday, this is nearly 2x what it was 3 days ago and peaked at 175k today.https://www.coindesk.com/confusion-euphoria-bitcoin-cash-30-billion-2000/ A billion dollar pump and dump, unlikely, this is the market sending a message.
Tired of the FUD around Roger Ver, the guy is strong believer in cryptocurrency and I have no reason to doubt his intentions.And it's that people want the faster transactions and lower fees of BCH
amazing conclusion
So what are you saying?
we have noticed already BCC has lost more than 30% and is now trading at US$ $1120.96!!!!
it is loosing value and bit coin is up again!!!
the hash rate graph dates back to 5 Nov!!!
yesterday they mentioned 200K unconfirmed transactions so it has gone down to 115K well that is an improvement....if the price of BCC were to increase beyond $2000 then I suppose the hash rate calculation for BCC would have proven and become more difficult!!
