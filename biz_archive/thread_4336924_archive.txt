Her left nip has what appears to be the two telling bumps left and right of it, but I can't 100% tell if that's the case.

I'll have a guess at this one;NULSDBIXKYBER or 0xXMRETH (obviously)How did I do?
Someone redpill me on substratum.
Noone wants to shill or redpill anyone cos its kinda longer term coin and biz is all about pnd-s bro...Do your own due diligence, long story short:-huge problem solving;-but in stages so its not hit or miss;-supersolid team acually doing shit and all transparent;-its not shitty token, competition is week and way behind;I called ETH and Antshares, i call this 2 digit coin minimum and its 0.1 now lol.But it will take time 6-12 m to get of.So go and chase next pnd like chink nuls and shit -fuck solid investments.
KNCETHAMBOMGThe 4 main growth spots for blockcbain industries are in these 4 coins and they will be the winners in each of their respective areas.

Nobody listed my top 5 coins, definitely a good sign.
Ardor and prolly ignis
REQ, OMG, SUMO, ETH, CND
