Is this thing just gonna slowly bleed now or what?
This is no bleeding man, we are back to the same sats we were yesterday this hour.
It's still nice uptrend since November 17th.
LEARN PATIENCE baka
simple retracement due to BTC elevation.
Wait till BTC decreases in value and see what happens.
Also volume is 150 BTC more than it was 12 hours ago literal whale games at this point.
good idea to short with them obviously if you have the autism to monitor the chart but otherwise HODLNOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY BTW
This is a coin that'll hit $500 mil.
market cap and everyone will be like "what the fuck is this" and asking themselves how they missed it.
This is going to $1.00.
