Seriously, people are complaining about CHEAP LINKS.
But it's just a fucking bot that keeps on selling and buying from itself.A normal person can't even buy 50 k of links without making the price jump 10-15%.Link is fine, just wait for some news, you can't even buy shit on the price shown.
yup.
it's all just chinese shenanigans.
the usual in this space.
just crack a beer open n chillax.
Conditional orders aren't allowed.
But bots are.
Really gets your almonds tingling.
Seriously, my blockfolio showed me it was 1980 satoshi's so I wanted to buy 100 k, turns out the real average price for 100 k is around 2200 satoshi, and you can't even accumulate slowly without a fucking bot one upping you every nano second.
just market buy
Yup.
If you can't get your limit order filled due to the bots, just eat the lowest sell order.
