Dip is overconfirmed ICO buyer sold 90% of his bags, now we are setting off for stage two, get in before you cryhttps://etherdelta.com/#EPY-ETHhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/emphy/
what the fuck is wrong with etherdelta?
this shit exchange is so hard to use.
I'm trying to buy my epy but i only have the option to change the quantity and price..I want to just put in the max about of eth that I have deposited but it wont let me.
is this how it's supposed to work?
you should check for some etherdelta toutorials, this shit has awful ui
and easy to make mistakes on orders if you don't check everything twice
I honestly cant imagine being such a brainlet and not understanding ether delta right awayholy shit
Use your brain you IQlet.
You need to start thinking in satoshis/wei sooner or later.Buy <some random value>Price <whatever the lowest ask is at the time, adjust to your desire>the cost they will automatically calculate and show you, from there just adjust the values until you're happy
ready for this 10x so comfy
