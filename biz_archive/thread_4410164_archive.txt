Someone tell me why rise isn't the perfect long term hold.
because it doesn't risexD
xDDD
I said long term nibba
Its a wannabe coin
>RISE>falls instead of rising>topkek
Nobody has ever heard about it so I guess IF they have a solid team it could be good to get in.
I'm probably not going to, because of ark and link but can you shill or redpill me on it?
I'm gonna make it with this one just u watch
I dunno man my frien said its a good buy and they looked cool, i brought some like 5k worth cause she's cheapy cheapy atm id reccomend it good tech good team come on in we're heading to the MOON
I just read up on it and looked at the charts and holy fuck does it swing.
You could 4-5x easily whenever it spikes.
I also read that they plan to have physical copies, which is interesting to say the least, but they are overreaching probably, it seems like they almost want to turn Rise into a world currency that normies actually use to like, pay bills shop with.
I'll go look at their whitepaper though
hehe xd
I skimmed through the whitepaper and it honestly looks like it could be a decent coin, but are you voting for delegates?
5k worth should provide a decent passive income, but I dont have time to look up on the delegates and how much they share atm
