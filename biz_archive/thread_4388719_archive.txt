The more population & pop.
density goes up, so will the value of land.
Its gonna be triple impossible(whatever that is) to buy land in places like CA in the not so far away future.

Blockchain smart contracts are gonna be huge too.
My brother's betting on another housing crash in the next couple years and that's when he's buying
holy shit... BUY CHAINLINK
It's much more complicated than that anon.
Chain link is just the next step from what ethereal created - a crypto that offers a service rather than just a store of value.
