Why are you people so fucking stupid?
It's never enough to give you a subtle fucking hint that you're making a clown of yourself, you always have to make me rub your fucking noses in it.https:// z.cash/support/zig.htmlADDRESS TYPESZcash transparent addresses, aka T-addrs, are very similar to Bitcoin addresses.
Zcash also provides Z-addrs which are used for sending and receiving private funds, with transactions cryptographically protected with Zero-Knowledge proofs.
T-addrs all begin with a t… prefix whereas Z-addrs always begin with a z… prefix.
