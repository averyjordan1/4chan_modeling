Hello, /biz/!
I have an acces to free energy in my uni and about 6-21 CPUs (1-6 core) and about the same amount of GPUs (sometimes way better than cpu) in comutper classes where I work as system administartor.
They used in education for 2-6 hours a day.We decided to mine some shitcoins on them and save at least on pizza in next year because so many computing powers stay unused.
So, tell me, /biz/, what shitcoins should we try to mine?
Any advice would be useful.
BTG
Tether
CFD
4481603Any more?
Monero, the True Criminal Coin!
First and foremost, you can only afford to mine if you live in China or any other third world country.
Otherwise it isn't worthy
