If it breaks 6700, buy instantly though.
>If it breaks 6700, buy instantly though.it probably will, but it'll be a headfake, then it will move lower.
can someone explain to me why i keep hearing 4900 as support line why not 5k for example
there's usually a strong resistance at the round numbers, like how it dopped to 6100 a few times today before falling through to 5, if it reaches 4900 it's game over because a BCC/BCH will be worth more USD than a BCC.
is still "around" the 5000 but yeah.
My guess is that it will stay there though and only move upwards, basing it on market memory.Also it's probably already happening.
>tfw bought at 6100 on the way down>could've waited and got it much cheaperWhy do I always mistime the dips?
How do you buy at the bottom?
Just look for the formations.
Crypto is an incredibly forgiving market there, most of the time it behaves exactly as TA predicts it will.
You wouldn't be able to do shit with Bollinger Bands on FOREX, but in crypto it's a golden ticket to the sky.
So it's safe to say BTC is going to surf down now.
