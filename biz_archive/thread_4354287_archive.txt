Over diversifying a small amount of money
What should I leave out?
Just wait for one of them to dip hard to go all in.
Sell when you have some profits and keep doing that until you have enough money to diversify
OP with that kind of money you shouldn't diversify into more than 4 or 5 coins and even that's pushing itJust wait for one of them to dip hardhe missed his chance to do that, literally all of these dipped hard within the past month because of the forks
All pretty good pics, op.I would say also dance with xmr and waves
omg.ark,neo,eth, already mooned, so they dont give you more gains, so move it to new stable coins, once you get gains, then diversify to stable coins.
that woman is too old for you to be investing in ETH, fuck off LARPer
didnt buy lsk but bought ark instead
look solid.
maybe put something in to btc/bch
dont be pussy with that amount of diversification.
