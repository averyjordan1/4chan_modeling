Can anyone honestly give me one good reason this coin won’t hit $1 tomorrow ?
300 + million marketcap .
not happeneing
No
It won't, it'll hit $1 in Jan. Get in now.
Nobody can, its not gonna stop
It'll tank hard after PBC comes out.
It'll probably hit 60 cents and come back down.
Remember walton?
It rallied from 30 million to 217 million marketcap, this will also do the same meaning it will hit 60 cents and rebound.
Though $1 does look tasty...
TOTAL SHITCOIN
4454257“Good reason”I think you guys didn’t understand the question
I forecast a 1B+ marketcap by Marchpeople are underestimating how valuable energy is
I think tomorrow $1 is very wishful thinking but by EOY $1 is a very reasonable prediction
I agree maybe sooner desu if any partnerships are announced such as Tesla
are you an expert on the value of energy?
lol goy
tesla partnership lol!!
!goyyyyyyy
POWR is fag shit garbage
Mmm maybe 50 cents, though I hold powr still and took some profit, I kind of feel it might start a downtrend
because it is trash getting shilled by biz
