Can someone ELI5 me what will happen when BCH's difficulty jump 400% in an hour?Does that mean that it will be more difficult to mine BCH, and miners will leave BCH for BTC?
What about the BCH fork on Monday?Will these factors affect the price?
If the difficulty goes up, miners will move to BTC and all those hanging transactions will start to clear.
Only then will the true whales begin dumping their frozen BTC for BCH after realizing their money can take days to move if some retard decides to spam the chain.
But BCH difficulty won't go up because China
it's a bear trap, the flippening will still happen, BCH will be 5000 USD by monday, hold
And these whales also lost 70 percent of there money lol guy on twitter bought 7000 btc he has held since 2012 for bcc at around 2400 lol
Can someone ELI5 me what will happen when BCH's difficulty jump 400% in an hour?People will stop mining BCH and resume mining BTC.
Everything will continue as normal because the market doesn't actually care about BTC's scaling woes.>What about the BCH fork on Monday?This is not a contentious hard fork.
Nobody will mine the old chain.
There are no dividends to be had.>Will these factors affect the price?You missed the pump.
You missed the dump.
If you're still holding now, you're about to lose it all.Now kill yourself please, leddit nigger
