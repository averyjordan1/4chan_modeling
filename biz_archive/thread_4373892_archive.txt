I miss the days where investing a coin wasn't hard.
We haven't seen a solid moon in a while.
By which I mean a moon that guarantees gains.
Remember NEO, it took a solid week for it to moon, whereas now it takes 5 minutes for BCC to moon and crash.
Next one is ETP, check price in one month and screencap.
don't blow it.
