YESSSSA150 sats get
Dead coin.... nothing here folks
MOON-SAN ONEGAI
FIX THE ELECTRUM SERVER, YOU CUNTS
FYI, those are fake buy walls, just like last night as the bullshit of this whole "project" was exposed.
Touch that 20+ buywall and see how fast it drops 10 sats
Sorry the money is flowing into real alts not PnD shitcoins
RIP my 56K verge coins bought @ 115, the coin is dead AF
Sold my XVG at a loss while BTC mooned because I just didn't want to deal with this coin anymore.
BTC drops ass back down.
Fuck me.
This coin is a fucking joke.
Ill keep my bags for now but I dont think ill be able to sell with profit
I bought at 117 and sold at 100.
To be fair I didn't have THAT much into it but it still pissed me off.
Can anyone explain why everyone is calling it DEAD / fucking joke coin?I don't hold any verge.
Just wondering
They never have met deadlines.
They lie about things that will be done.
Their stories on twitter do not add up - a fucking 4 year old could figure out these guys are fake
none of this shit is real.
do your own research kek
/biz/ fears what it doesnt understandbegin a vergen will make a comeback
holding since 36sat not selling til at least 50 cents
its a /biz/ meme.
we pump it up on announcements and then dump on reddit bagholders when the news ends up being fake or delayed.
its amazing
kek still believing in this shitcoin.
Managed to profit off the wraith protocol hype tho
This will MOON in the upcoming days.
I live in Japan and people are talking a lot about it.
Get it at 39-40k sats, sell for 70-75.
Easy profit.
