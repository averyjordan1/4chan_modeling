So I've seen some people who shill BCH here and claim they only do it because they believe in BCH, have actually started shilling Bitmain.Why would anyone shill a mining equipment company unless they are being paid to do so?
we're all shills here
Dragonsmint is coming and jihan is shitted
retardsI'm just in it for the next pump
-> 
You know Bitmain moved into AI development recently?
What if all these shills were actually a program that they've developed to induce fomo
The funny thing is I don't even care how good or bad Jihan's business is unless he tries to undermine a financial revolution that's well underway.
Give them a break, cashies are simply brain washed.
Although, they are arguably stupid as fuck, too.
That's actually not as ridiculous as it sounds.
I hear complaints about how weird the shills' language from time to time.
At least they look really weird and out of touch on /biz/, don't know about reddit.
I've noticed the same thing.
But I think it's because they are foreign.
Occasional grammatical mistakes, but with uncommon spelling mistakes, mixed with strange metaphors that don't cross over to English well.
Anything is possible these days.
Especially when 10's of billions of dollars are involved
a lot of people who support bch are miners so they either buy from bitmain or one of the 2-3 other competition companies.
Bitmain is just a successful company you should try to control your anger and jealousy over that.
