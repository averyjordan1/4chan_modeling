IM NOT CALM IM NOT CALM I'M NOT FUCKING CALMWhat the fuck do I do with my alts, /biz/?
Is it all over?
Don't watch charts/open biz for a week or two, enjoy life, come back by the end of this month, and by then your alts will be doing great compared to usd.
alts will come back after btc and bch stabilize around 4k each.
They'll be competing with each other for a while.
During that time ETH and alts will see renewed interest as the "Safe" havens of BCH and BTC are relatively stable.
Screencap this.
Hold.
Don't sell a god damn thing.Your alts will be fine at the end of this.ONE of the bitcoin chains is gonna get rekt though.
buy bch then go into alts after everything has smoothed over.Btc can not recover from this miners are leaving already and there are already 100k+ unconfirmed transactions they will all be buying BCH
Thanks guys.
BCH is dumping now.
