Whats biz experiance with localbitcoins irl exchanges ?
Btc2cash
cashing out>everjoking, of course.
Well, its localised by country so i can only talk about my expiriences in Croatia, but i had no problems at all, guys at only such service here in Croatia were friendly, accessible, told me everything i wanted to know, and deal was done in few hours, me sending them btc and them sending me cash on my bank account.
But like i said, i guess it depends on country, here they are completely trustworthy, however that doesnt mean in other countries are as well.
Most of them IRL buyers are undercover agents of Tax Departments that will bust your ass for tax-evasion and money laundering.
