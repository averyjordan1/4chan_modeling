RLC MINIONS ASSEMBLE.
Strap on your seat belts and enjoy the ride full of comfyness.

Still rising.
Why not invest into a solid coin at the bottom at the very start of a moon mission for a change?
Funny how the average /biztard doesn't care about something really good for a change.
Anyway, chase pnd of scamcoins.
Screencapping for reference.
trying to fud RLC is like trying to fud MOD or XMR, never works becouse there are no arguments.
going all in on these.
also, not sure if a moon mission, there haven't been any news recently.
this is just fluctuation, it will go to 0.90 at best and then drop to around 0.50 worst.
NO PR
I think things are a bit different on this one.
More long term holders, much slower movement.

PR is only good for PnD, afaik most good alts that made it didn't have PR.i hope you are wrong becouse i can't buy more until the day after tomorrow.
I hope I am right!
Need to get rich!
