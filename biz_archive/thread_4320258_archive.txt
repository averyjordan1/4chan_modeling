How many of you are going to take a break from crypto?
This shitstorm seems to never end and I'm just tired of it.
I am as soon as I get my fucking btc back, going to leave it on my ledger and never come here for at least 6 months.
Why?
I am making money flipping internet coins.
What a time to be alive!
