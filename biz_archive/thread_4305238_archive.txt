Bitcoin seems to be bouncing of pretty gracefully from $6200 despite the update still rolling out and spam clogging the Blockchain.Is it over?
no you need to buy bitcoin cash this is true BITCOINdo the needful sir, sell buy this one today for big gains
I think so.
62 was the floor for the collapse.
It might sink sub 6, but that'll be slower.
I'm buying now.
Nope.
I mean, it might sputter a little bit, but the definite direction is Bitcoin Cash surpassing it.
You're going to need more exchange support to allow fiat to head directly to Cash, but give it 3-6 months and that's inevitable.

remember when BTC was $600 at the year ad you missed it?, dont let it happen again.
As long as we don't break 6100, things look survivable
Yeah, it seems that we're nearing the moment of truth.
Market definitely is very uncertain about its future direction.
