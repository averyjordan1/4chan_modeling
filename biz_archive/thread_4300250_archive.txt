Nice just bought 100K.
You make fun of Factom now, but you will not be laughing in a few days.
I hold Factom since I bought it like 0.0112.
I must be holding for a longer time but I feel horrible for not selling sooner.Looks like it's recovering nicely though.

Funny.
Factom has already gone up 30c since you last wrote that.
