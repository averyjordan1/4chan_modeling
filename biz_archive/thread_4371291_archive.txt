Any of you anon have access to multiple exchanges and can confirm whether there are large buy walls spontaneously popping up on all or some of them?
Bittrex shows a 10k BTC buy wall every few minutes pop in and out.
Wondering if this is being done on all exchanges or just Bittrex.
That's the signal.
there was a 10k btc buy wall on bittrex last night too but then it went awaymy take is that roger or some of the big miners are going to make sure this doesnt drop below 1kknowing that ive just been using my 30k stack to swing trade the minor fluctuations between 1200 and 1300 for a few days.
Made a few thousand which is cool.
Pretty much just waiting for a breakout on BCH to go all in.
Clever.
Yeah i've been watching it and it seems, like any good PnD, that they must be in collection phase.
Was the PBRC release telling people to buy BCH and store in the wallet real?
I wonder if the intent was to then lock access to those wallets while the big pump happens so people dont dump early.
Just a theory.
PBRC release telling people to buy BCH and store in the walletwtf, sauce?
You mean PBC ?The buy alert was real with a buy up to 1400$ price and no stoploss.He always recommend subscribers to store their coins on a wallet rather than exchanges.
He also said he would notify us when to sell.
Just hang out on /biz/ there's always someone posting the alerts in the first few minutes
that street shitter tells people to buy a few hundred dollarydoos worth of things.
you give him entirely too much credit.
yes it was a PBRC pick but everyone ignored it because we only pay attention when it is obscure shitcoins no one will ever use
Probably because obscure shitcoins have no context, therefore sky is the limit!
sir i am not sure the concern we are only looking for lasting success in business desire
