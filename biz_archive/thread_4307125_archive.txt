Okay you got my attentionShill me this shitcoin
It's just a snapshot-fork of bitcoin with all the features of Bitcoin, Bitcash, and Bitcoin Gold in one.20mb block sizeSegwit->Lightning capabilities (also masternodes hinted)CPU+GPU minableWas premined, but in the last year the premine has been handled extremely professionally.
The idea was to distribute the airdrop in a way similar to how the forks worked, granting people with BTC private keys first access to BTX.
eventually this was expanded to allowing BTX holders in the wallet to get a weekly distribution from the supply.BTX is essentially a virtual fork of bitcoin with a combination of the philosophies that make all the current iterations of bitcoin good.
I'll admit this one has been a good trading coin, scoop below 100k sats and sell at like 150k has tended to be a reliable strat.Sold all mine at the pump to 200k sats recently, so I have no skin in the game.
Is the airdrop still going?
What do I need to get in?
HitBTC manipulates the prices hard.
I don't even use the exchange because of it.
They wanted to be given 25% of Confido in exchange for listing it.
if BTX moves like btg or bch did then I don't give a shit if they manipulate it
you just need to put 10 (?)
BTX in your wallet, and register your address using a private message function in the wallethas an explanation/tutorial in the website, keeps out the pajeets basically
>tfw I claimed "muh free money" 2 hours before that they closed they airdrop.I don't give a fuck if the manipulate the price, hope it moons.
keeps out the pajeets basicallyWhen airdrop dev pls bb no scam
