Dont need to be an insider to know that
good , the entire planet is waiting for a dip
hum... why?
Can't wait to finally get into btc once its done dipping.
literallythis
already priced in
I don't even understand how tether can cause this, even if it went to 0
Level 2 insider here, It will bounce to 10k within 24 hours of this event
What is the purpose of these posts?
Even if you managed to FUD half of biz into selling all their BTC, it would have all of about 0.000001% impact on price.
And that's probably being generous.
>You don't short a trend like this>Wait for a bearish sign to get back>We are going to 20K on the corpses of bears
and this is why bitcoin wont drop any significant amount.
because everyone and their dog is waiting to buy in at every single round number along the way
this, oh no some shitcoin got scammed lets pull out completely
im waiting for a dip its go to happen....then there will be a buying frenzy.....
You do know the definition of a trend is that it's temporary right?
We've had a week straight of the bull and now have undeniable reason to be bearish.
You're not looking at this logically.
this is why I went all in bch.
What happens to the shitcoins within BTC if BTC dips way too much?
I don't want to shoot myself in the leg so I'll shoot myself in the dick instead.
