WTF is this garbage and why is it top 5

Probably the best currency coin out there.
It tends to pump every time there is a BCH/BTC battle.
It gots them masternodes so a lot of people never dumped it.
If you have 1,000 Dash, you would be generating 3,900 dollars a month right now.
sounds like a flat pyramid scheme to me
Jesus.
But is this coin legit or some stupid masternode scheme?
It's a price manipulated premined scam coin that no one uses but somehow they wash traded the price up over $500
Launched as a instamine premine scamcoin with 1000 blocks a minute and no windows wallet, then they cut the total supply down to 25% after they had enough, then fixed it, made it legit, and renamed it.
One of cryptos greatest scams but noobs don't even know because of the name change.
