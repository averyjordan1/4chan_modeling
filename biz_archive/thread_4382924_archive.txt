Will this slanted eyed faggot ever get arrested in the future for this gigantic P&D?I'm not affected because I didn't trust BCH, but I'm still angry.
fuck your mother if you want to fuck
if Bithumb didn't crash that night, BCH might have landed the killing blow right then and there.
it blew past .5 on finex right before the Koreans shit the bed.
this tells me that there is significant strength backing BCH and they're going to inevitably try again, and from an even better position now that the upgrade was successfully activated
deluded bagholder lolllll
Because it already almost happened, it has a large chance of actually flippen now.
you know he's right.
Ahh, the ultimate chad.
1200ng/ml testosterone levels minimum.
congratz, seriously.
I'm more pissed off at all the dumbass who though BCH would really replaced Bitcoin.I guess we reached the point where the flow of new investors has an average IQ inferior to 100.
