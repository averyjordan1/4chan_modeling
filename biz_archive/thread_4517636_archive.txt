Buy IOP now if you wanna make it to lamboland.
Thank me later.
How about fuck you later.
Quit spamming the board with shitty bitch coins, you ass fart.
bluepaper is released >nothing happensYay such ebin gains
I'm convinced this project is going to explode soon.
I don't mind holding bags if it means I'm in before the normies.
What makes it different from other coins?
You can run nodes on raspberry pi's or cellphones.
They want to decentralize entire communities and will be having ICOs in the future that will require IOP to participate.
The team is active and has good devs.
The volume is 1 million a day right now and the market cap is only 4 million.
No premine of coins as the circulating supply is the same as total supply.
It's honestly a joke this isn't atleast 20 million market cap.
What is the coin for?
Also i have the feeling you bought into bluepaper hype and you have bags now.
I bought 2 days ago, sold 50 min pre bluepaper for a good 20%.. i like the project but dont know if i ahould reenter
Likes the project>Doesn't know what the coin doesDo you know how retarded you sound there pajeet?
