I'm sorry I fucked up please let me back in please
You had months to accumulate
I sold yesterday at a 1k sat profit to try and get more BTC to get more ark.
Fucking bought at 60k sats and held all the way.
Now I've missed the boat and I'm devastated.Don't be me, guys.
So right now you have no ark?
No.. DESU hoping btc goes on a bull run and gives me a better entry point.
If that doesn't happen I'll buy back at 49 anyway
Tonight's moon will be glorious.

days, loyalty bonus starts over on the coins you get tho so say you get 1new coin you get 90%on all your others and 80%on that one new coin
implying it will still be that low when you finally buyAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAH
