10hours ago anon made a trade about this shit I knew it was risky but went in and it paid well, thanks a lot anon you made my day !
nice one
you're welcome.
I’m not shilling it, don’t buy it now.
It was a lucky buy yesterday but it’s late to buy now.
Should I put my profit in confido ?
What the fuck is it?
Holy fuck, we need a mass extinction of this shit.
The first time you hear about something is when it spikes by 63,598% for no fuckin reason.
tfw went in on RCN because it was lower riskfeelsbad
No, my tip is to have a look at the recently added on cmc it had not even 1mio marketcap befor the pump it was something like 1.4 cent.
Maybe I’ll buy back later when it dips more and buy confido before it hits an exchange.
Confido is dropping too.
Bought it at 37 cents, reached 60 cents now its 55.
Just spent 10 bucks on it so i dont care.
1 dollar at least or bust ( althought im fairly confident it will reach 15 mil market cap which would put it at 1 dollar.)
I’ll buy if it dips more but i’m Scared because of the previous pump
Thanks for original nio anon.
2,5x my coss with this
