2018 begins the war on Crypto.Massive kill offMassive corporate power grabsGovernment intervention (a lot of you know what paperwork I'm talking about)
Crypto is international and designed to resist being destroyed.Unless the entire internet shuts down, it will remain and continue to grow.
literally the opposite of what will happen
implying the 'elite' are not stocked on cryptos already Dude, even Sean Spicer deleted his wallet address tweet, THEY ALREADY KNOW The normies will be the ones to suffer the most...good riddance
just because it's decentralized doesn't mean that UN can't control how it's used.This is going to usher in globalization extremely fast.They will try to shut down a decentralized reserve that's currently designed for massive crypto & decentralization adoption
My theory is exactly the opposite.The elites want a one world currency however they knew that it would be the mother of all shitstorms if they tried to force it on people.
So they unleash bitcoin and after a faux struggle we the people adopt it of our own free will.
That's how they get us to accept a global currency.
