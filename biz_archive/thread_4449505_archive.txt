hmm.looks like one of those 32bit integer type of phenomenon...stuff like this -1 is common in videogames once reaching high scores.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problemhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,147,483,647
>AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
In computingThe number 2,147,483,647 (or hexadecimal 7FFF,FFFF16) is the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing.
It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as integers (e.g., as int) in many programming languages, and the maximum possible score, money, etc.
for many video games.
The appearance of the number often reflects an error, overflow condition, or missing value.
[9] In December 2014, Google initially claimed that PSY's music video "Gangnam Style" exceeded the 32-bit integer limit for YouTube view count, necessitating YouTube to upgrade the variable to a 64-bit integer.

AND HOW DO I FUCKING FIX IT !?
USDT EXIT SCAM


you brainlet.
Buy 1 omg coin using your exchange wallet and move it to your margin wallet....LMAO you opened a long position ; D
OP, calm down.Click on "Exchange" on the order form, buy one OMG, click on your OMG exchange balance, click transfer, move it to your margin wallet.You opened a margin position for OMG, that won't work.
idk my only personal experience with this bug was in mmorpgs.. try finding some sort of email or support.you need to get your balance reset to 0.000000000000then it will start showing correct values.

>using a french scammer's exchangeThey do this on purpose so you have to do another trade and rack up more fees.You have to do the minimum trade order to clear it which is $5.
Then the remaining of the $5 is left in the exchange, there's no way to withdraw it so they get to keep your money.There's a reason it was closed in the USA
