Is it too late to invest in nintendo stocks or does it still have room to grow even further?
All the upcoming hits (Pokemon switch, Metroid) are already priced in IMO.
The sales of the 3DS will disappear as they stop producing games for it and no one know if all those users will make the transition to the switch.
It is a big question mark IMO.
Nintendo has a few good ERs ahead of them imo, At this point you'd be betting on their deals with universal pay off and the switch gains even MORE momentum.
I think their mobile venture is pretty much as good as it will get.
If Animal Crossing can't blow up nothing can.
