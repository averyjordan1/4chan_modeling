I just moved all my BTC to ETH when it was $7950.
DUnno man, the sell walls are preventing it from going over $8k.
going to sleep is never a good idea.
Take some addy and stay up all night worrying.Honestly though I would buy BCH.
It might not be great long term but at SOME POINT IT HAS TO SPIKE AGIAN RIGHT?
I fomo panic sold and lost about 1/80 of my btc.
Hopefully it moons.

Hard to explain.
Just try it and find out.

You thought ARK was going to keep diving too?

Why short BTC?
Are you writing a book titled "My Path to Insurmountable Losses"?
if you have unsettled liabilities the big jew in the sky requires you to come back to earth as a filipino ladyboy until your debts are paid.
