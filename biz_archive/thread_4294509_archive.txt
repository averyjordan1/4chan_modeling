What was the biggest pump n dump in crypto history?
Bitcoin cash in a couple minutes
Shitcoin 6000 percent yesterday and now at the same price as it was 3 days ago
Within 3 years DGB will be trading quite higher than its ATH.
This coin is literally just getting started.
Minereum maybe....It fell from 480,000sats to 3,800 sats and I fucking held with a large position.
Bitcoin.
Bitcoinit's just a VERY long pump
Was anyone here for ReddCoin?We pumped it from 2 satoshis all the way to 137.
Literally the worst one.
Which one
Easily Bancor
Damn.
You could have made $2 mil in a month if you knew the megapump was coming

I dont understand what you just said.
In terms of shitcoin and profit, it has to be Mooncoin or SIGT handsdown.
Bancor never pumped in the first place it just dumped straight from ICO so that doesn't count as a pump and dump

The ICO was the pump phase my senpai
pump and dump?
nolook at fucking SIGT, it was way worse.
