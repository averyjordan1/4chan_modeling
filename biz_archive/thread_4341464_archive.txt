He thinks exchanges run all software in a simple windows machine.> He thinks multiwallets are implementing any code from bitcoin gold people beyond the path and a few more shitLol, nice try, but /biz/ originally came from /g/ so we know a thing or two more than you about servers ok?
Dumbest larp I've read in a while.
steal almost all the cryptocoin on the world MUWHAHAHA> then cryptcoin values go down and now they are worh almost nothingWhat a great and perfect plan..... now seriously, I just dont understand /biz/, its probably the most autistic board on the entire 4chan.. wtf... usually people like to be complete delusional about shitcoins but when they go further than that then people on /x/ start to look more sane than us...
% are not delusional, they are just lying and trying to lie to you to get something out of you.To get you to buy their bags, to get you to lower the price so they can buy more, etc.1% is deluded and believes what others told them and just repeats it though, those are the poor souls that /biz/ has taken
ima steal all them coins and cash em out before they lose their value and nobody will notice
