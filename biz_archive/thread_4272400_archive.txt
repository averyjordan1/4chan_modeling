Not by a long shot.
AMIS went up +4728.90% in the last 7 days, and NULS is on the start of a +40000%.
wow i love crypto now
It is the PROPHECY.
4273729What coin were they referring to?
NULS
Think about getting some NULS... right or wrong?
They haven't gone away, it's just that less coins are getting concurrently pumped, and for shorter periods of time.
Think musical chairs, with half the chairs, happening in 4x speed.
high risk high reward right now, there is a lot of questions around the team and their development.
if you have balls and want to take a risk NULS could be the next NEO
They're on coinexchange
One Belt, One Road.
