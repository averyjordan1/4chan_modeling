whats a reddit?
Good.
The mods are doing their job.
Do you expect them to sit by while people violently attack Bitcoin, clearly pushing the inferior altcoin Btrash?
Go back to r/btc and leave this board alone pleb
Why are white people so thin skinned that their only course of action is nuking?
r/bitcoin is a bitcoin church.
r btc does the same with pro core posts
Reminds me of /r/dogecoin during their peak hype.I browsed /bitcoin back then in 2013 and it seemed fine but now its just retarded.
I cant tell if its mostly full of actual shills or typical; reddit teenagers because their community is just herd mentality, take top upvoted posts as the word of gospel, and brigade anything not bitcoin related.Everytime I make the mistake to check it out its either one of these three posts:>Bitcoin mooning, told you guys!
hehe buy even more, hodl boys>Bitcoin dip, hehe we're veterans been trading ~2 months now, dips are normal, hehe buy even more, hodl boys>Our transactions would go faster but fuckin Roger Ver wont let em!
[citation needed]
That's nice.
Also>you have to go back
This is any subreddit for any coin.
The OMG subreddit was even worse than this a couple months ago.
Reddit is filled with the biggest faggots on this planet.
Really unironically wish death on most of the userbase.
The only upside of crypto collapsing and me losing all my money is that I'm taking these insufferable faggots with me.
don't need to because coretards get smashed without needing to delete them
r/bitcoin seems like the most nigger t_d tier redditscum.
r/btc is pure butthurt bcash shilling.
what are some legit high iq btc forums?
irc or death?

The pajeet and shills invasion is fucking annoying, good.
Keep these shitcoiners away
