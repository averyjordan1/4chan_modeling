if any of you faggots have any patience while holding your shitcoin bags you could just trade this pair all day for the next a couple months and make substantial earnings.
its so fucking easy - when one goes up the other goes down instantly

No way!
How did you figure this out?
They've only been inverse for the past week.
On BTC's last bull run BCH was gaining even more than BTC.
all ive seen on /biz/ lately is some bullshit btc vs bch.
fuck it, embrace it and exploit it to make some money.
who gives a fuck about who endorses what coin
Fuck your mother if you want to fuck

It's scary though.

Are you converting to fiat?
Keeping them in crypto of course.
