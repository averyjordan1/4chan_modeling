Just wanna know who bought Factom yesterday when I told you to.
Just want to get to know my fellow crew members on this rocketship to 4X land, you know?
This is what free money looks like
better hope they gain customers using the service in large quantities before they release M4, or the value of a Factoid will drop like you cant imagine through them releasing 84000 new Factoids a month......with pretty much none being burned as it stands now
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
All I understand is $$$
suggest you start trying to understand...no factoids being burned, 84000 factoids a month going to be released into the market = what does that mean for the value of the token....
let me help himcoins burning=value of a single coin increasescoins being release= ..?
All alts are pumping; wake me up when FCT has really gone 4X, because then Iâ€™ll be up 2X from where I bought in at least.
:(
4262729The only understanding of "$$" you'll be doing is it fucking dropping as the supply goes up and price goes down.
Retard.
wait, do you guys actually HOLD alt coins?
nice try but your still a retard
