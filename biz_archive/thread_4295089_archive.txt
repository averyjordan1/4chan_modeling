So....dump to zero?Plus it's BINANCE, the literal GRAVEYARD of crypto.
Enjoy the Binance Kiss of Death.
Can't wait to buy in after the dump.
.5/10
Hahhahahah wait a minuteThey're not only coming ti DEATHnance...they're also pairing up with CHAINLINK?AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHHAHAHAH what a comboBinance + Chainlink.Will Confido be the first ERC20 token to drop to literal zero sats?
Binance is only the kiss of death if itâ€™s overbought prior.
Confido = Dumpido
DumpidoKEK
It's already 10x gain... wait until it hits binance for massive sell offs
What's wrong with binance and link?Binance is the best exchange and Link the most promising, interesting project in crypto right now.
If it dips... im going balls deep.
The psychology of "I made 10x I have to get out fast to protect my gains" never fails.
It's pretty much the reverse of sunken cost fallacy.I'll refer to it as risen gains fallacy.
Btw I already have a chunk of confido and have gotten nice gains.
It's still super undervalued though.
It's not even priced into the hype if it is a vaporcoin.
You buffoons don't realize that once it hits Binance it will be dime a dozen shitcoin listed there.
Nobody will care.Sorry.
ICO folks won - no more soup for you., move on.
When???????
ThisI missed the ICO but keep accumulating on dips.
IN my opinion its relatively underalued and will shoot up again once protoype is released.
