I've been making video games on the side for a few years.
My most recent one is actually gaining some traction.
It's made ~$14,000 so far in 2017, I'm expecting more in 2018.I recently incorporated a company and transferred everything to it so I have some liability protection.
What else should I do to cover my ass?
How much should it make before I quit my job (currently 42k/year)?
this is absolutely the wrong place to askthis is just a crypto containment shit heap boardAsk AGDG on /vg/ if you want to ask anyone on 4chan, specifically see if you can ask the people there who have actually made it and may have some insight like hopoo (the risk of rain guy, dunno if he still posts)
shit then.. /biz/ should be renamed /crypto/ lol
Buy STEEM
no shit son, fucking crypto gold rush, getting tired of this shit
Are you a bot or something?
