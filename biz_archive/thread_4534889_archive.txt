Did Binance stop working for anyone else after the 1.3.0 Android update?
Yes.
Shit does not work for me.
Garbage.
Ahh there was new update 1.3.1.
Works now
I like them for that.
They work fast
Nice.Binance is one of the few exchanges that seem to give a shit about fixing problems fast, be it customer service for specific customers or more serious issues like this.
Yes, top service.
