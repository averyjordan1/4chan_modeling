anons were making threads saying to buy cash for days now, you didn't fall for the paid core shills and their low quality FUD did you?
The flippening is very much a real possibility still.

What did he mean by this?
The flippening lads.I implore you all to understand that BCH has a tremendous amount of support.
You will see this.

Why did massive amounts of Korean volume poor in?
Do you look at these things?BCH is going to make moves in these next 7 days that look absurd.
Please take note.
