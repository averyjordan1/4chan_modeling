It looks like BCH is recovering ohhhhhhhh shittttttttttttttttttttttttt

LOL RECOVERINGliterally dropped 1 thousand dollars in 20 mins
Bitthumb is back
The largest exchange with 50% of all transactions was taken offline momentarilyI thought it was a whale or group of whales dumping all his BCH on the market, but it just turns out it was 50% of the fucking buying power coming inI expect more pumps, this bull run isn't over.
It's your time to get in at this low of a price
already made 20k off this scam today bud, i'm not risking making more I just did big trades.
with bitthump back online its going back up
Just look at how fast BCH dumped due to Bitthumb going offline, imagine how fast it will dump once the whales deem it so.
