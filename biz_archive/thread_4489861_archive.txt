I'm thinking of putting $5k (roughly 25% of my portfolio) into ASTRO because in my limited research, the team seems legit and not another Confido.
But I want to be certain I haven't overlooked anything, so if any of you have any realistic reasoning why ASTRO might be a scam please let me know.
I put some money in last week.
No blog posts since ICO.
I can't find a link to their telegram even though they post a screenshot of it.
Their subreddit is semi-active.I'm holding out until the dividend.
t.me/astronautofficial they posted it ages ago on their twitter or so, they should pin it somewhereFounder is also pretty active there
Just over 1000k Astro here.
Pretty comfy hold.
t.me/astronautofficialAwesome.
Thanks!
It's a solid buy m8

I got 300 at $2.31.
Its lost like half its value :,(
I got 1050 at an average price of around $1.90, so I'm at more of a loss than you.
No biggie, the total supply is 4 million and it's only on ED.
It's going to be way more than $2.31 within a few months (unless we get a royal JOOSTING, of course, but that risk is present with all altcoins).
if it dips below a dollar i'll consider it
