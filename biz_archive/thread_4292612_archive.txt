Does anyone here plan to become a Chainlink node operator?
Interested in getting ideas for what data to provide aside from data returned from existing APIs.
What kind of data do you think will be in demand early on?
self bump
bump for you
Sage for everyone.
Fuck link threads
This is not even about the fucking token, we're talking about blockchain usage you fucking knee-jerk spazz
t.not gonna make it
I have already got everything setup to be a chainlink node operator.
Finding a niche of what data to provide has been something i've been thinking about as well.
I've thought about doing something with e-sports.
But i found there are already some decent API's for that.
