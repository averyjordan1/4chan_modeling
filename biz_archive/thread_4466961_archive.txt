So I have about $110,000 dedicated to invest into real estate.The cheapest home in my county by $100,000 just popped up...
It is in bad condition, 30-40 minutes away from an amazing job center (Tesla, Google, Apple) head quarters, but the problem is it is 455k....I can buy it and rent it out, but I would have no place to live.
I think it could rent out for about 2000-2500, but the market is VERY high.This is a cuck shed... Not a nice home....My dad is moving up to Seattle area.
Should I just move up with him and buy a decent home, or a city home, or buy my cuck shed in bay area?
Bay Area real estate is in a bubble.
Buy in an emerging market, not at the peak.
Just see if you can find something with a better potential ROI in the northwest.
The shitty house will probably need more repairs and maintenance also.
"Bay Area real estate is in a bubble"No it's not, because there are 3 factors keeping the prices up...Lots of high income jobs, highest cost of construction (permits), and they dramatically limit development, and it's very popular with chinese/indian tech workers due to jobs.It is artificially limited housing, but it has been like this for many years.
Median Seattle home price is about 750k.
And there are no houses to buy in Seattle.
kitsap/bremerton/port orchard/port townsend area included
He is correct.
Live long Seattlite here.
your saying don't buy seattle property?It is still cheaper than bay area...I have to spend my 110,000 on property...https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/WA/apartment_duplex_type/23398043_zpid/59_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/47.542266,-122.691407,47.493342,-122.772174_rect/13_zm/https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Boulder-Creek-CA/house_type/16159259_zpid/17128_rid/globalrelevanceex_sort/37.228073,-122.051754,37.112624,-122.213288_rect/12_zm/
compare and discuss....I am required to invest 110,000 in one of these two properties, I will be borrowing @ 4.5% for 30 years.

The shed has potential.
Forest everywhere, nice big windows, I love it.
Must be a bitch to heat, but looks liveable.
