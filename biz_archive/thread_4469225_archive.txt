Did the alt market peak already?>muh long term investmentsAre we just not gonna make it 2 years from now?We were too late to hope on the crypto bandwagon weren't we
You sound retarded OP.
>Did the alt market peak alreadyThe alt market is still at the floor because the normie wave is just starting to finally pick up speed for BTC thanks to the mainstream media.
Where do you think normie investors are going to go once the BTC train slows down?Alts are still super fucking niche and most people you ask won't know what the fuck you're talking about if you even mention Ripple, Dash, OMG, ETH Classic, etc.
2 years is a long fucking time in crypto.
You are guaranteed to make it if you take profits from the BTC rise and dump it all into a few very strong alts for 2018.
alts time is 2018
