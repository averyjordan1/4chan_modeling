Any suggestions?What should my next move be?
Stop larping and show your ttrex account

You have much faith in /biz memes

Suggestion: unfuck your decimals and commas.
You're using faggot numbers.
Utter garbage, buy ETH with all your holdings.
nice folio but where are your links bro
im to lazy to type in everything after the comma desu
Its missing Dubaicoin.
just wait and do nothing would be your best bet.Maybe add some more REQ
Are you retarded?
That's a perfectly sane portfolio.
Although I would split that BTC into BTC/ETH
