I've made so much money buying this around 0.03 and selling around 0.06.
I don't really understand why somebody is accumulating it, but can't complain.

Literally the reason.
Surely nobody with the money to do that is actually that stupid.
It is tethered to gold though.
Each BTG can be exchanged for one ounce of gold via Apmex.
shinny gold, people will accept it more because they will relate it to gold
