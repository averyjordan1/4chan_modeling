>Missed ANS>Missed rebrand>Missed first dip>Missed >Missed>MissedJust bought news I couldn't even read, trevon fucking made it though right goys?
Still time to get in , its early.
This coin will reach 300$ by the end of next year.
Are you a fucking indian what did I just say nigger
It will be $100 end of this year provided you are not another one of this panic faggots who sell when the price drops a few dollars for an hour.
Where is crypto king these days?
I though for sure he would be coming back for this run.
Yeah honestly it could pay off or it could lose you a lot of moneyIf i was online when the news hit and could of bought in now I would of got in but I'm just gonna stay out of this one now, I've had bad experiences with NEO in the past.
(apart from the ans to neo rebrand that shit was cash)I would look into some solid alts that are low right now and out of the spotlight that neo is hogging.
Stuff like ARK thats always been a popular alt and has news coming literally within a week would be a good bet, but id encourage you to do your own research and find a coin you actually believe in yourself
Seriously dude you are going to be kicking yourself for not getting into NEO at this price, I made the same mistake with ETH and I am still in pain.
I sold 1000 ETH at $20.
can confirm not those faggotsnot sure which king you mean
could pay off or it could lose you a lot of moneyI think most likely lose a bit on news selling, but more room to go up than down.
Dips on paper don't phase me though
I sold 1000 ETH at $20I literally warned you anon
bald headed dude always posted selfies.
no shit i am here all day every day and have no idea who this guy is
>be me>be simpleton>buy antshares at $4>ignore it until rebrand and sell at $45 >haven't been in NEO in 2 months>after BTC hit 8k I go almost all in at the nice dip ~360k sat.
>next day that tweet comes and the pump aswellwho else /blessed/ here by their gut?my gut > ur TA
u mind sending me 1000 bucks
nice work, i neglected ANS and after the first pump i chalked it up to a miss.. this method has held me down this year but could get caught out on fomo here.
i'm not all in or anything though so really im setup for regret either way
goin up =)
You're right, he's been MIA.
Surly he still believes >>neo $100 by December
