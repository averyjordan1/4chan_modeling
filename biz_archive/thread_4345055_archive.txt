 Go cry in your socialist circlejerk.
I'd make more money investing in Bitconnect than Bitcoin Communist
Obviously the answer is REQ.
People are civil>Nobody insults the guy who said BCH>Insult the OP for choosing to go with BTCGreat job
BCH if you want to earn money, BTC if you want to lose it

chinks>civilized interactionsPick one anon.
I wanna get rich fast thats all
Stay out of the space until it's known if BCH or BTC will be dominant.
Then keep your eyes out for promising alts that could one day usurp the BTC/BCH throne (no PoW coins though).
ARK
ARK, no question
XMR
BCH or ETPnot subtle at all
ETH.
Monero is a steaming piece of shit
Uhhh can you decide on one?
Go all in on RPC
