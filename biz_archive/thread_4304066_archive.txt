Do you guys really pay taxes on your coin gains?
Bitcoin Cash fork on the 13th, that's why it's shooting up now.
Congratulations brother
Only if you cash out.
In the US the IRS will be up your ass.
Keep good records.
will there be free coins for bch holders or will that shit lock erryone out?
yup, not really interested in spending time in jail.
IRS dont fuck around
What if you just withdraw it from ATM's?
Or open a bank account in another country with a lax government and cash out there?
I always think this when I see these threads.How dumb is /biz/ to blindly believe a LARPer with extremely easy-to-fake evidence?
Nice one Felix W. Since you can't still in the discord you've been banned from you go 4chan.This dude is well known for constantly posting his blockfolio all the time.
Holders of BTH get the forked coins yes.
imagine being so stupid that you pay taxes on your crypto
BTH = bitcoin cashBCC = also bitcoin cash on bittrexcorrect?bcc holders also get coins or is it just specific to a few exchanges?
4304505No there's no forked coins.
This isn't a contentious hard fork.
The emergency difficulty adjustment is getting ditched.
That's it.
What if you just withdraw it from ATM's?Withdrawing from atms is cashing out.
>Or open a bank account in another country with a lax government and cash out there?That's shady.
