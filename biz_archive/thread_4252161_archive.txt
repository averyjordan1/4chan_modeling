Tell me, anon, what should I buy now?
BTC ofcourse, but what else?
I think it could be walton, VTC for example.
But I don't know how to buy this shit.
Buy some EMB on cryptopia LTC markets, it's dirt cheap and there's a big coin burn coming at the end of the month.... Small market cap, lots of room for growth
The 'free Bitcoin' threads are LARPs 100% of the time bro.
hmm, i always thought this but some random anon sent me 0.02 bcc the other day
Is there any way to actually BUY shitcoins in cryptopia?
