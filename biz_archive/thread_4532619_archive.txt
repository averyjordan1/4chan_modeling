I work on average 60 hours a week at a movie theater and my foot is fucked.
My life isn't hard but my foot is fucked and my main source of income is from walking and moving shit all day and running around making orders and running shit (which I can't do now.)
How the fuck do I afford a doctor?
Or could someone give me the most sound financial advice to make money to get me through school now that I can't walk for shit?
I've been relegated to tearing tickets in a chair for 3 weeks in a row now, I wanna neck myself.
I also drive a manual and my left foot makes driving it feel so fucking awful I can't even begin to describe, it stresses out whatever muscle or tendon that's fucked to the nth degree.
Any financial advice?>tl;dr>foots fucked, need advice on how to pay for fixing my foot or just getting a job that i can do without walking or moving my left foot thanks, /biz/
Google free clinic near me
probably sprained or broken toe, nothing major but u will need to deal with it otherwise it will keep hurtingand potentially get worse
Take some strong ibuprofen not Tylenol, soak it in some ice.
Stay off of it.
I work in healthcare, that's probably what a doctor is going to tell you after he assrapes you with X-rays and other bills.
Also you might want to think about wrapping it.
You can get air casts and splints from walgreens
I treated my shoulder like this.
Job involves a lot of lifting.
Took a few months but it's fine now basically.
Get a gym membership too.
