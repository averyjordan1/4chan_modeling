Wouldn't allowing ISP's to charge websites and services such as Facebook and Google for the heavy load of bandwidth they requires using the assets of the ISP's, which Facebook and co. would pass costs onto the consumer, giving actual/more valuation to these companies?
What if the next government changes the laws back to what they were?
Not likely ISPs will take the risk.
ISPs are slow like fucking snails to change anything about them.
I would also think that by allowing to charge more for the usage of their assets, the ISP industry would be able to fund more R&D while also being able to expand/upgrade their assets.
This would provide jobs while attracting more investment capital as their returns might actually become worth it to actually invest in the market, drawing even more money to build jobs with.
The costs passed onto the consumer would give sites like 4chan a possible way to finally monetize, bringing in a second .com boom.
But the ISP already pays more for it's server bandwith.
Shit websites already have bandwith problems because they can't afford the big numbers: case in point kraken.End of net neutrality would only cuck the consumers.
Imagine shit websites being doubly shit because on top of them not being able to afford a lot of bandwith, you're being throttled on your side as well?
