Can’t tell who’s a shill and who’s dropping actual knowledge.
Ask people questions.
What's the use case?
Is the token necessary?
What creates future buy pressure on tokens?
etc etc
Is the token necessary?This is the biggest fucking question that always should be asked.
So many tokens are actually fucking useless and monetary value shouldn't be a large factor in their existence
Hahaha.
We arrive at this point again.
Where another poor soul finally realizes that crypto is a scam because you can't cash out.You LITERALLY can't fucking cash out.
Seriously, try it.
You wasted all your money on internet bucks.
There is no way to convert it back to fiat.
All those "exchanges" that claim to deposit your money into your bank?
Those are scams, the deposit never goes through.
All those people saying it isn't a scam?
They're shills for the scam "exchanges.
"Anyone who tries to refute this post is a scammer shilling for scammy exchanges.

I always say 100% what I think.
There's too much shilling as it is already.
Dude I just press "withdraw" and it goes right in my back account (in 5 days, but whatever).It works lol.
I do not believe ANYTHING I read here.
The only way to learn is by studying, and hard experience.
Most of us do things the hard way so we get burnt before we learn.
If you are here long enough you'd know this is a copypasta
