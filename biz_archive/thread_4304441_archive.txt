Biz seriously pisses me off.
Y'all promised that LINK would never go under 20 cents again, and I believed the lies.Now I'm a fucking bagholder because of you cunts.
A note to others: don't fall for the LINK memes
EBET (https://ethbet.io/) is the new /our coin/, OP.just started today, hop on before it's too late.
good luck.
hodl strong anon.
Literally no one was saying LINK is NOT going below 20 cents again.
People said it might be the new home but the general message was that 20 cent is still fucking cheap for the gains to come.
You're still going to make mad profit in the long term.
Some days Link is on sale more than others.
