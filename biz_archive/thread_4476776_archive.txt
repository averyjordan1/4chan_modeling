Quantstamp on binance
Binance really is where coins go to die.Look at the all time history of 70% if coins on there; they just plummet
Only shitcoins, QSP is not, ETHOS is not, POWR is not, many are not.
Only the shitty coins plummit
What if binance is just a giant whale group that dumps whatever icos they buy out?
LINK plummeted too...
That's cause the ones who got the coins first had a huge bonus and sold.
They're gonna buy back at the dip
I know HITBTC does this.
I can tell you're new.
Any time a coin is freshly listen on a major exchange, ico holders can find buy orders to sell into, and it nosedives for a while.
Do you not remember when Poloniex was really the only big exchange, and the first Zcash were sold for ~400 BTC to bait people?
Or when BCH was dispersed and everyone was an instant bagholder so we scrambled to sell asap, and newbies at that time dubbed it "bitcoin crash"?
Have you never mined a new coin before it was listed anywhere (pascal for me)?
This has nothing to do with the value of a coin, just the size of the exchange.
Lots of people only see what shows up on their home exchange.
This is normal.
Part of it is because binance has such low fees that it encourages bots to continually bid the price downward, this is made worse when it's the only exchange for a coin.
Look at graphs of stocks before and after algorithmic trading became commonplace.
