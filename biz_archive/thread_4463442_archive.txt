Alright figs, you memed me into a small LINK position.
I actually like the project and it seems pretty stable at the current price.Still going to FUD it though, LINK memes are too funny not to.
You have to FUD it.
All of us are still accumulatingLINK is the next POWR.
That shitcoin has a similar circulating supply to LINK, but expect LINK to do 30x
All you need to know about LINK is only 3% or something like that are getting traded, everyone keeps it in their wallets.
anyone who has 10k+ LINK will make it, that's a guarantee
Sheeit I have 112k LINKI wont forget you 4chan for letting me know about this coin so early on in its lifespan
446346770k here, we're all gonna make it.
Better watch out for Sergey.
