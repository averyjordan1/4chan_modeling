Anyone else here waking up at night and feeling like they ran thirty miles?
My body aches and I am sweaty.
However, I am cold.
Feverish chills run through my body.
I get up and look out at the trees outside my house.
They are all dead and withered.
It makes me shake.
Something is happening I just don’t know what yet.
I feel like I am hurtling towards a precipice.
I will either fly or fall.
My feet leave the ground.
I begin to descent into the abyss.
I hear a voice.
“The oracle problem has been solved.” I soar to the heavens.I wake up in silk trappings on a bed whose mattress is feathered with peacock plumage.
Attractive wenches pour wine in my cup.
It was just another dream.
Life is good.
Please be nice to Rory.
You went all in at ATH didn't you?
