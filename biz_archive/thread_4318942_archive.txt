I feel you.
I am kicking myself for just not selling over and over again whenever the shit recovered.
It was literally the best choice to fucking SELL EVERYTHING AS SOON AS IT MOVED, REBUY, SELL AGAIN.
This fuckingm retard market is costing me the last nerves.
No, because you never know when the market breaks out and starts an insane bullrun.
It's better to buy bigger and sell half while prices rise.
So you can rebuy if the sideways trend continues but are not left out if the pattern changes.
You are right.
Overall gains are smaller but you always profit no matter in what direction it goes.
I guess I am too greedy.
But timing this market at the moment is IMPOSSIBLE anyway.
Have to lurk and wait without Blockfolio.
>buy at .290>set loss limit at .240>go to bed>wake up>missed out on .40. liquidated at .240feeling kinda JUST right now.
