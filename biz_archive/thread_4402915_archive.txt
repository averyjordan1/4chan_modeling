THIS IS MY LAST RESORT.
SUFFOCATION, NO BREATHING.
DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF I CUT MY ARM BLEEDING.
Repeat after me:"Buy high, sell low",that's the way we roll.FUD the pumpso, the coin I'll dump.The Lambo I lust,but the wallet JUST.Short the bull,long the bear.Leverage for lull...Dreams into thin air!Even a tiny drop and I fold!No rebounce to my weak hands..."Trend's changing!
Set the strong hold!
",My bad!
It forever descends...The whale is Yellow,the dollar is green.Pink Wojak fellow,hold this bag you're so keen.
stop chasing fomo pumps.
look at fundementals with emotions aside.
bch is a centralized coin that breaks the consenus rules of bitcoin protocol that people invested millions of into for over 9 years.
the infustructure built around bitcoin for 9 years.
u really think 2-3 people in control of an alt will dethrown what thousands and hundreds of thousands invested and thousands of devs gave their life for?
cmon man the whole point of btc is nobody can change the rules unless everyone agrees.
and if everyone doesnt agree then the rules stay the same
