Will XMR go back down to $85 by wednesday?
No it will first rise to .023 btc before a small dip occurs
You reckon?
When shall we start to see this happen
Honestly just speculating my man, I'm no fortune teller.
But when I look at the 3 month chart and what happened In august, I feel as if it is on a similar trend right now.
Though I don't think it will break ath before dipping this time, because bitcoin is on an uptrend again it seems.
I feel like this will happen in the next 1-3 days.
Though I don't think it will dip back 80, maybe like 100 or so, but I'm being optimistic
Maybe selling what i have now and waiting for shit to settle is a wise idea.
My xmr is at a gain, so really dont wanna loss that to be honest
XMR is one of those coins that's going to rise 70% one day and never go back.
It's the perfect long term hold.
If you want to take profits fair enough, there's a very good chance it will drop down near $100 again.
But just be aware that you might miss the train.
