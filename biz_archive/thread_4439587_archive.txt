Anyone here a Certified Bitcoin Professional with C4?
Wondering how easy it is and if you've had any luck getting jobs with it afterwards?
I'd like to know this too.
As an accountant it seems like a worthwhile thing to have on the resume for only $140.
Of course it was silly of me to ask a board that's too busy chasing pump and dumps to actually consider doing something to further their careers.
