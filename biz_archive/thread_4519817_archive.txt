why do you feel the need to shill a shitcoin that has been bleeding forever?
stay poor pajeet
you're the pajeet, pajeet
Only a pajeet can detect a pajeet this fast.
At least put some effort into your daily COSS shills.
Nobody is actually going to buy this shitcoin, the least you could do is be amusing while you try to find a sucker to offload your bags on to.

 COSS> bagstop fuckin kek
My Coss bags are pretty heavy.
Is this thing ever going to do anything?
Who cares.
Its at minimal value.
You are not actively loosing money.
Anything that it does makes it better.
Thats the thing, % wise it could already go up really fast, and you still get dividents if it does not
Shill me this shit and i might buy.
Before you do, try using the exchange, then read the latest dev update.
Can you honestly imaging people using this exchange over the alternatives?
Where are the real decentralized exchanges at?
what dividends lmaothe 1% annually?
just go take a shit pajeet

Fucking faggot scammer fucks, fuck coss, it will likely exit scam at some point or just go under for whatever reason

I can't believe there are people still fudding this coin.
Of those still holding it, there's absolutely no way they will believe your fud.

4522159Do you use COSS for your regular trading?
Been happening for months, check the archives if you don't believe me.
Yeah and it's the same low-grade crap every time.
Ask them about dev progress and they call you a pajeet and run away.
