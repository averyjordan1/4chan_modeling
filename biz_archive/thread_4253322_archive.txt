so I wandered onto here curious as to what cryptocurrencies were.
Is there money in this, how does this work, and where can I learn to trade them?
Go watch youtube
>I want you peope to spend effort and time to spoonfed me personally about things I could just go read the basics of easily in a thread that will bring nothing of value to anyone else than me.No.
tl;dr for this entire board:> If you didn't buy everything, you're a brainlet.
Is there money in this
this and  thisthe spergs on this board wont waste their time being friendly, go watch some videos and stuff, do a bit of basic research then come back.but to answer your question, yes, theres a lot of money in this.
cryptos are basically the new and improved wall street, theres a shit tonne of money to be madew if you do your research and are smart
It's completely worthless as a form of currency for everyday spending.
Its only value is to be traded for ridiculous amounts of money between foolhardy traders.
