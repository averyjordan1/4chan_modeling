When did you realise BTC was king?>Be me in Feb - one of you start shilling on >POL about ETH and XRP, buy 2500 dollars >of ETH and 50 dollars of XRP>Mad gains>Buy DGB (mah 1 dollar by Christmas)>Ride it from 100 Sats to 2600, >get off at 1600 during the bull trap>Get mad, sell all shitty alts into BTC>Hold 90 percent BTC to 10 percent ETHAlts are literally just a tool to be leveraged to make bitcoin.
When I lost a big chunk of my crypto with byteball.I said fuck itI got, like you, about 90% in BTC.Just a bit in other long-term unknown coins for now
After ETH peaked in June, BTC became a very comfy hold.
I didn't realize it until after I made many trading mistakes as a new trader.
If I would have just consolidated to BTC, I would have been much better off.I also should have been more humble with my first trading experiments.
I was swinging too much money around as a novice trader.
I said fuck itDo you hold any alts at all?My only regret is missing 'moon missions' but I'm also comfy with current holdings... My peak BTC value was 21, I have spent three on renovating my house, so I lost about 5 or 6 through holding alts too long...
Hate to think the damage others have suffered.
