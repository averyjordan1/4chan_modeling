is IOTA worth it?
It has a few problems that are endemic to the project.
One of those is the fact that developers insist on patenting parts of the coin.
Otherwise the tangle is actually Superior to blockchain.And the wallet is a buggy mess.
so its a coin to basically wait and see, but not invest yet?
curious myself, and I don't feel like doing actual research.

ZAP > Iota
First of all the devs are incompetent assholes and should be pushed aside to let a better more mature project take the lead.Second has anyone here actually tried to send transactions through the tangle?
It's a horrible, buggy mess that barely works if at all.2/10 would not invest.

comparison makes no sense.

It sounds pretty unique in a good way, but I have some doubts about how centralized it seems to be.
I wouldn't touch that shit anytime soon.
Devs are psychopaths, community is toxic, and no one gives a fuck about it.
The crypto market is too crowded, IOTA will never stand out being surrounded by assholes.
Centralized closed source shitcoinThey get butthurt over internet comments and have even threatened to sue people over themCult-like community, with delicate feelingsThere's no evidence the network could function without their "temporary" authoritarian node hosting the networkIn fact, nobody knows how it works, because most technical questions get ignored or deflected into political debates by the developersI have a better name for it: "pssst" (pansy snowflake safe-space token)My analysis of the white paper indicates it is very very likely to be a scam project targeting tech-illiterate euphoric hipsters, with high effectiveness
