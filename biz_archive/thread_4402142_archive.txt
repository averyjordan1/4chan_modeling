Other coins do make amazing strides and get pumped for 5 minutes then dumpedMeanwhile Bitcoin is on its way to having 395975375 unconfirmed transactions, not even working, and being worth 10 billion dollars
4402162I really hate bitcoin too.
I mean unlike scam ICOs it can literally kill the market.
looks like you guys didn't get fucked hard enough by BCC to understand to put your orders in on the down tick, idk wtf people think buying ATH, its one thing to buy in at early growth but literally waiting until this point to buy BTC as opposed to monday is fucking retarded.
it probably will hit 8k+ by the weekend but you can also fucking guarantee that it will correct back to a flat 7k or less by next monday.
At this point you're better off waiting for a bigger dip.
