>famous Japanese anime writer was arrested for CP>his career is ruined, new films/works are cancelled>Vitalik tweets promoting CP>ETH goes up from $300 to $360 in the following weeksCan someone explain this?
Omg I don't like his opinion and I'm going to shit post in /biz/ about it
No one cares, this is not bizrelated.
I never said that.
I'm asking for discussion of this from an economic standpoint.
Whats expected after this sort of tweet is a drop in ETH's price as investors would be scared off.
But the opposite happened, which could be a sign that contrarian investing is truly the best investing mindset.
CP token when?
No one cares, this is not bizrelated.Were you even on /biz/ when this happened?
There were like 20 threads about this tweet for a day or two.
Vitalik just tweeted his opinion, anime guy actually got arrested for possession i would guess.
