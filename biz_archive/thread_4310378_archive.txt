YET ANOTHER block with 7 BTC in tx fees (!!)
and an hour delay from the previous one.
It's only going to get worse.
Take a look my friends.
Here we have a block where the MAJORITY of the reward is in Tx fees:- 13.4 Tx fees- 12.5 block reward--> total 25.9 BTCAnd it's still more worth it for miners to mine BCH!
Get used to this, it's the new normal.
All your money is being bled gradually to the miners.
