I think the ODN fud brigade is second in sadness only to the DGB marines.
Shit is bordering on outright mental illness.
well how do you ODN defenders explain THIS
It is.
I don't understand why they fudd.
It's not like they were scammed.
It's not like they lost money; the fudd brigade started when we first passed 15k sats on the way upThe only reason and purpose the Fud serves is to keep the price down.The only ones who would want to price to tank is a competitor coin or whales to buy cheaper.
Hopefully it's whales so they can pump it because I'm not selling.The fudding is so dedicated it is just not logical.
Hopefully it stops soon
are you the stalker?
