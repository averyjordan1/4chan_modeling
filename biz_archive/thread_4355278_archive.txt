IT'S OVER, LADS.RIP Core.
With the fork of Bitcoin Core, the legacy token is officially dead.
Bitcoin Gold is the coin that Satoshi originally envisioned.
Bitcoin Gold solves the technical issues that the closed inner circle of core devs arrogantly refused to acknowledged were killing Bitcoin.
I am elated lads.
I sold all of my BTC and went 100% into BTG.
Please remember that it is Bitcoin Gold - not "B Gold".
BTG is another segwitshitcoin, not at all what satoshi intended.
You're just a falseflagging corecuck shitposter.
Wrong, noob.
Bitcoin Gold is here to stay.
It is the real Bitcoin.
Keep your airdrop safe, lads.
It's the future of crypto.
Cashing out all my BCH next to get into BTG.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
this.. the only asic-resistant PoW Bitcoin fork I'd be interested would have to be forked from Bitcoin Cash at this point

Makes sense that non profit orgs would target BCH bag carriers.
Charities need people who are willing to give away their wealth while expecting nothing in return.
u mad?
this thread reeks smell of spoiled curry
so what's so bad about segwit?
doesn't it just reduce the size of a transaction, by removing the signature from the beginning of the transaction and adding it in later?
There is nothing wrong with segwit, a bunch of FUDposters want people to think its a vulnerability, when in reality its not, and just a scaling solution.
Segwit 2X v. 15 was fatally flawed.
Core 14 saw it for the Virus it was.
Get fucked BCashers.
You realize btc has already adopted segwit, right?
lmao, the absolute state of corecucks
