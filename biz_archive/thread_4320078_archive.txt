I was thinking about this.
Is this a legit option?
Almost all moons have a dead cat bounce and it's very easy to spot and seems to be very profitable.
Has anyone ever tried it?
Try if you want, but sometimes it double dips before going up again.
That single trade will kill the profits you got from the 10 previous successful ones.
easy to spotHaha I'll gladly take your money
