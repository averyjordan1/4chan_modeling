Why did it go up so much today?
>he thinks coins need to have a reason to randomly pump heh...
Because of one charile lee post replying to feathercoins tweet about some picture.
Is FTC legit tech-wise?
bump
so some anon with this in his bag will say yes, and you're just going to believe him just like that?
why even ask this?
Guys, invest now.Shit's about to go down...
explain
FTC is pretty legit.
It's fast, it's secure, and it's ASIC resistant.
Kind of like GRS.
It probably has a few more pumps in it.
There is a new update and its a contender to be the spendable version of BTC.
I would advise everyone to invest now.
It seems the whales are taking advantage of this coin's low traffic and high speed to use it as an intermediary in order to move around lots of BTC quickly between exchanges.
This will probably continue for the next day or two before they move on to another coin.
Target is 5k sats.
why the fuk do you faggots actually spend the time to make these stupid pictures?
does it actually work?
so cringy
Now that's a name I haven't heard in a long long time
Keeps going up.
If you aren't in by now, I'd say stay out, but really this could go all night.
