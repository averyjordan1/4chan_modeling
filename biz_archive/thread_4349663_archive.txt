Hey /biz/ETH is going for $290 at Cobinhood and $315 at Kraken.
What's stopping me from buying ETH with fiat at Cobinhood, transferring it to Kraken and sell at $315?
nothing, but you are not the only one, the price will stabilize quickly
kraken doesn't function.
Holy shit dude.
You figured out a hole in the system, hurry up and take advantage of it!!
This is why you utilize multiple marketplaces.
