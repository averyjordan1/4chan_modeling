Holy shit Bitcoin Cash is actually replacing BTC.I sold all my BCH for $40.
What an idiot I was.
Then again, BCH is a shitty altcoin in my eyes even when it's one day worth a million.
The thing is that, if the flippening actually happens bch would be btc and btc would be called bitcoin classic or whatever.
That's just horrible.I spent my mortgage on BTC.
You did what, mate
u gotta spend big to win big..
i hope you are larping.
How much did you make/loss so far?
all in monero, fuck this btc bullshit
Just wait until it gets closer to parity with BTC and trade so you'll have the same amount, or go all in now and 5x your money
i swear i'll never understand this.
"Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose" isn't a fucking meme.
If the entire market suddenly went to zero, never to recover, I would be fine.
Sure I would be physically fucking sick due to losing the money i've invested and accumulated, but otherwise i'd be fine.
I would still have my savings, i wouldn't lose my house or anything like that, because I only invested money that I didn't "need" for anything else.
This.
But only 80%.
Use the rest to trade shitcoins to make more XMR.
"but what if..."
