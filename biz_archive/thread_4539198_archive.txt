We arrive at this point again.
Where another poor soul finally realizes that crypto is a scam because you can't cash out.You LITERALLY can't fucking cash out.
Seriously, try it.
You wasted all your money on internet bucks.
There is no way to convert it back to fiat.
All those "exchanges" that claim to deposit your money into your bank?
Those are scams, the deposit never goes through.
All those people saying it isn't a scam?
They're shills for the scam "exchanges.
"Anyone who tries to refute this post is a scammer shilling for scammy exchanges.
