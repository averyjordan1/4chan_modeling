Meme analysis is showing a nice bull flag on ETH/USD.
Time to make a run at $400.
And then short the crap out of it.
On what basis?
because it'll be very close to its ATHwhich means it'll either dump hard or moon hardand last time eth was near its 415$ ATH, it dumped hard, all the way down to 260$ infact before it showed signs of recovery, and was stuck at 300$ for two months
higher sell pressure meaning people stopping longs which further amplifies the effect
Look at the log charts retard.
This is bound for $1000 by mid 18
