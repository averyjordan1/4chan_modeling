Once ODN goes below .15 cents and ODN is proven to be a scam we need to all make sure Sagemark is sent to prison.
There is just no possible way he should be able to get away with a scam for the third time.
There's so much evidence that I don't see a single chance of him getting out of this when brought to the attention of the FBI.
ODN and sagemark are the worst of crypto.
And no I'm not FUDing you deluded faggots.
