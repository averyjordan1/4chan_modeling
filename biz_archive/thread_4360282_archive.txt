Are cryptocurrencies a pyramid scheme.
There are no transaction records and its a bunch of people buying with hopes somone else will purchase it at a higher price.
Eventually the price will get so high noone can afford it, and the whole thing will collapse.
Stay poor boomer

Im also waiting for heavy government regulations once there's a drug or sex traffickin scandal.
