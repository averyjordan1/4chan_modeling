Amber (AMB) Avatar Binance1 hour agoThe Ambrosus network is a blockchain-based ecosystem for supply chains, ensuring the origin, quality, compliance and proper handling of items tracked by the network.
Ambrosus’ primary focus is on improving supply chains for life-essential products, specifically food and medicine, although the protocol can be applied to almost any complex supply chain.By using distributed ledgers, data processing and sensor systems, the Ambrosus platform can integrate across supply chain flows and enable transparency at every point within them.
These new capabilities allow buyers and other participants in the supply chain to ensure that the standards of their Quality Assurance programs are being met.
Ambrosus also enables the transmission of additional information between supply chain counterparties, as well as the creation of new applications and markets that utilize the platform’s real-time data.Ambrosus is an end-to-end integrated solution that includes hardware, software, a protocol layer and developer tools.
The heart of the Ambrosus network is the Amber token, an ERC-20 compliant token that underpins all transactions on the Ambrosus network.Amber is the world's first data-bonded token.
It is used to bind continuously updated and verified logistical, environmental and biological data from the supply chain to its corresponding product as it travels between counterparties.
It is also used to carry out transfers of value within the ecosystem.
As such, the token performs both the utility and transfer of value functions within the ecosystem of applications built on top of Ambrosus protocol.Total Supply: 361,477,438ICO Supply: 144,590,975ICO Price: $ 0.30
