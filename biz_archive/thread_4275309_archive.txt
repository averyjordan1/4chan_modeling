caused out all my gains from mod evx powr nuls and sub on binance, I'm still in REQ.
What should I do with my BTC now on binance?
Anything to buy for more gains?
Don't say raiden though it has a medium sized marketcap already
You got out of NULS too early anon.
got out with over 200% gains at $1, I'm a happy person with that.
he didnt.
im waitng for the massive dip.
finished product in 5 years.
give me a break sell this and buy back cheaper.
Its already around 40m cap.
it needs to cool off
people were happy with 200% gains at $1.00 on bitcoin too.... just saying...
I wonder how many actually killed themselves?
