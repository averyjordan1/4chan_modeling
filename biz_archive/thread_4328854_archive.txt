BTC crashing, overall market cap crashing, all alts in a sea of red.
I am sad to say folks but the jig is up.
pull out your money and get the fuck out.
The BCC BTC war was the beginning of the end.
We had fun.
Some of us made money, some of us got burned but if you don't want to participate in the biggest crash of all time get the fuck out now.
Old fag warned us but we didn't listen.
This is the last chance.
Peace out bros.
I hope you all make it somehow but it's not here.

Lol.
This just a shedding of the valuation of a toxic asset, namely BTC.
Crypto overall is extremely undervalued.
It's best that this happened now rather than later.
BCH needs to die as well though but the flippening is a good first step.Sometimes you have to hurt a little but the cancer surgery is worth it.
Buy bch
one of the most clearheaded posts I've seen here in a while
Its not over just let any other coin take number 1.This "if btc is not number 1 we're doomed" mentality needs to day asap.
Meh, let the idiots think this.
If btc crashes and takes the whole market down/scares the normies away, fine by me.
Let me scoop up more cheap alts.
Alts are red because bitcoin is going down dummy, most are up relative to the amount of bitcoin
