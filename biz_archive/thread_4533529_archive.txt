Noob question for you /biz/Does the buy wall around 0.2 mean there's over 1,000 bids?
or over 1,000 BTC in bids?no bully pls
God, you're an idiot.
The wall represents bidders who want to buy at around .1 btc
Don't be a faggot.It means there's a sum of 1k btc or more in bids at 0.2
Someone wants to buy 1,000 BTC worth of BCH at 0.2 BTC per unit of BCH.
It's honestly not that big of a wall for something as high volume as BCH and at that price
1000BTC.
Yo why isn't BCC going up anymoreAm I fucked again
No, it represents Roger manipulating the market as usual.
Likely not until the difficulty change for BTC amounts to nothing.
Then money will exit BCH
Yes, and that's what you get for trusting a chink and a sociopathic felon.
I dont trust them, but everyone kept saying BTC was about to crash and i need to buy something safe.
so i bought BCC cause it was going up.
When will BTC difficulty adjust?
You should have just bought Ethereum or tether then.Also, Roger's shills lied.
Bitcoin isn't crashing.
There are institutional investors entering the market and the BTC difficulty adjustment is in 18 hours.
So will Roger remove the wall when people start selling into it..?
Currently estimated at 18 hours, but it'll likely be more than that
better him manipulating than tetherrrrrrs manipulating
Nah, the 'Roger wall' has always been down at 0.1.
This is just some dumb whale
I wanted to tether, but everyones saying that's about to blow up at any minute.
fuck.In with most of portoflio on BCC, and currently at 6% loss, will hurt if I don't get lucky :(
Random whales don't have 1000 BTC.
Also, the wall at 0.1 shrank by 1000 BTC when the wall at 0.2 went up.>i.e.
it's Roger.
