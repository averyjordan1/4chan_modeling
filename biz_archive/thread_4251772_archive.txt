The we implies no but probably.
>even if link will moon now, you could have had twice or even more the amount you currently havefugg

Unlikely.
BTC was the primary reason for the bleed.
It's going to stabilize around 25 or 30 cents as more money flows into alts.
Most people aren't even aware of s2x not happening.
Deluded nolinker.
The fork is over.
People have absolutely no reason to sell anymore.
