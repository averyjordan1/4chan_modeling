JAN 1 BCH APOCALYPSE
BTC is objectively a shitcoin.
muh Satoshi's vision

t. poor boy
literally this, BTC will be updated when needed, like how it was with segwit update.
No need for new shitcoins.
brainlet here, is it possible for it to get the name 'Bitcoin' with out cash at the end
Yes
Yup.
It would take several months of time though.It's name is basically just what the community chooses it to be.
They could even change the logo if BTC Legacy actually dies out.
He's right though.
It's been segwitted
Look, Bitcoin can't survive without centralisation.This is what Satoshi Nakamoto would have wanted.In fact, he never intended to limit bitcoin to 21 millions, we need to remove that silly, artificial limit.The more bitcoin there is, the more of a currency it become.All currencies need to be printable to the infinite to be viable.
*Ahem*Bitcoin Gold....
That is the point of Ethereums inflation: to actually become a viable currency.ETH has a high inflation right now.
About 14% per year or so.
But PoS is going to be implemented some time during the net year.
Vitalik hinted that Casper is closer than we think.With PoS, the inflation rate is thought to become something between 1-4% per year.
