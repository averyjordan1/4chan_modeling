How come it's so hard to convince your friends to buy Bitcoins?
I have been regularly telling my closest friends to buy Bitcoin since it was worth $1000 but they just don't listen.
This is such easy money and a rare opportunity.
Why can't they see this?
Even after I have shown them my massive gains they remain uninterested.
FUCKING NORMIES I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU.
never give anyone financial advice unless they ask for it.
Massive gains thanks to fucking tether.
I just want them to get rich with me so we can do cool stuff together.
stop doing this ffs.just let your friends fall behind they fucking suck
