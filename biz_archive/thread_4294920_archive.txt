Hello guys, I'm a NEET for now.
I recently graduated from a good university but am still having trouble finding a job and have a great desire to start in the world of cryptocurrencies.
I want you to help by giving me ALL free sources of bitcoin or any cryptocurrency listed on the exodus wallet.
I'm willing to claim from faucets all day long if necessary and accumulate crypto by all means possible.
Bitconnect is a ponzi and I don't have enough money to get good investments back so forget about it.
I'm currently using a few faucets and wondering if you got any more tips on getting more free bitcoins or any other worthy coins.

Total trash 9mm Hi- Point fired sideways by a goblin------> a random ant on the ground might be in danger, but I am not.
Goblin would be double tapped before the weapon was close to level.
Make multiple coinpot accounts if you can to take advantage of the moon faucets.
If you want a good place to gamble your bitcoin, i'd recomend satoshi mines.
