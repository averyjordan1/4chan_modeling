G-guys, was away yesterday for the alt moon....I-is it t-too late to get back in into a-alts?Also dont shill me your shitcoins, im asking for alts in general....
No This month alts will crash 50% while btc crashes to 2.666 dollar its all a p n d now cause everybody helped with the pump yesterday with the fomo of missing out
fomo of missing outDon't listen to this fucking pajeet
4264344ahhaha i kekked so hard
Go into ETH and your favorite alts NOW.
BTC crash is literally taking place as we speak, down from 7500 to 7000 today.
Once it breaks 68-6900 it's going down to 5k.
if btc goes down to 5k alts are going to hell together with it... (except for eth maybe)
rip in peace
3 vs 1 one man army:) their is no reason for btc to be this high and if btc crashes people cash out:)which means sell off in altsJust keep this in mindBefore segwit got cancelled ALL altcoins were going down in a falling knife wonder why?P N D buys in and waits for the FOMO to hit the people to so whales sell on top and you keep bagholding or sell low while they prepare for another round
not they wont...a lot of new normie money has just come into crypto, they see bitcoin down and all alts up what do you think theyre gonna do?
cash out after 2 weeks?

You better call yourself the normie cause when you jumped in crypto all the normies came:)and if you think im wrong well them me than mate WHICH money you see entering crypto?
