I'm moving to a new area for work, $60k a year.
I'm a penny pincher so I found an apartment with roommates for $600/mo including utilities, which is awesome.
It's also 5 miles from my work.Since that's not really walkable, I'm wanting to bike there, but it's a half hour ride and I'd like to get there a bit sooner.
I'd really like to avoid firing up the car for a measly 5 mile commute every day though, so I found an ebike on craigslist for $550 (retails for $2200).Here's the other thing.
My Nissan got recalled for the Takatta airbag debacle, so I'm currently driving a rental that they provided for free - meaning I'm essentially putting no mileage on my own car, for free.
Only real cost for me is gas.
So considering this ebike is a good deal and would provide me moar exercise but is still nearly an entire month's worth of rent; should I buy it?
My brother has an Ebike, they are awesome.
And they sell easily if you need to get rid of it.
Vastly superior to just a regular bike, because with the motor you just gently pedal and you can cruise uphill.I would consider all the situations where you might need a car though.
And consider that alternative.
You can get a decent shitbox for $2k.
Never buy ebikes with used battery, Never, that's the nr1 rule.I build ebikes based on shitty Chinese 8fun/bafang, they are solid af.
I ride a 750W bbs02 with a 27aH 48W battery, shit got a top speed at 65 and has a range of over 120km.Don't even need to pedal, got a handy gas button.
What the fuck?
Just get a regular fucking bicycle you lazy ass.
Can't I just buy a new one?I mean I just looked and there's a replacement one for $150.
Considering this is already a quarter the cost of buying one new, is that not still a hell of a deal?
