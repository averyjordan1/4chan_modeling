Kek sold at 800 thinking it would keep going downShould I rebuy now?
it's just really sad that threads like these get created only after a coin has gone up 30% in a day.
Ride 1K tomorrow then dump, less BTC actually doesn't recover, then just HODL.
Eeeh 4chan has been shilling bch for the past 2 weeks
holders gonna shill
Why are you shouting?
Look I've got over 2000 Bitcoin Cash.
I don't think you're going to see that sudden flip yet.
You have way too many normies who are barely aware Bitcoin Cash exists and drop their money into Bitcoin because that's all they know.
MINISTER (You), SATOSHI!
Not new to crypto, but pretty new to /biz/.

Real question.
Keep lurking

Textbook pump.
You're all morons.
only those who haven't bough sub-$600ofc buying now before some correction is too risky unless there will be some major news, like bch pairs on a big exchange
If BCH beats it's ATH of 1090 then the flippening is happening
Why?
Its ATH is a better representation of BTC, not it's fiat equivalent.
Last time it went to 0.2, when BTC was substantially cheaper.
Making it over like 1.5 won't ENGAGE THE FLIPPENING or something.
More likely, we will see another moon to .22 or so tops, and BCH will bleed out for another two months until it pretends to threaten the flippening again.
BCH
