And how do we assist in hunting him down and making him pay the ultimate price live streamed on youtube?
y-you stopped developing your confido a-app... y-you!
owe me a refund, no no no, not the original ICO price, i-i want my potential gains backId like to see him arrested though.
He should have just done a poorly job at everything if it was a scam instead of cutting and running.
Arrested?
I want to see blood in the street just like when CFD dumped.
I did make some nice gains off CFD from ICO entry price, but Joost must be brought to street justice
Joost is an anonymous fraud.Why do you think that is his true photo or name?Joost could be that Chris from telegram too.All these ICO scams are extremely cyberpunk.
Only major could find Joost
