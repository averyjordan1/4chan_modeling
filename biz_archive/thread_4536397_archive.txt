Ripple is a steady coin.... As it is aimed at centralized markets it will be controlled.
Some good news to its achievementHowever, AMEX is on boardhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1XBfsDfPjgIn addition we also seeStandard Chartered, Axis Now, RAKBANK now using RippleNethttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id-AkUV8wrk
2018 will be decent for xrp holders.
Not sure whether we will see a huge price increase til end of 2017.......
AMEX news was a pump and dump.
This coin is going nowhere.ChainLink is where the money's at!
the coin has gained a small amount it is trading @ 0.24US$ modest gains....
But then again this coin is for long term!
HahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahahahahaaahahahahaahhahahahhahahahahahahahahahahWait didnt SWIFT just said they are looking forward to work together with RIPPLE amd XRP?
Eventually SWIFT will make way for Ripple as it could be potentially lethal contender against them!
Looking forward to development in this front.... Ripple to be stellar in the future....

Thats actually pretty biiiig!I cant wait till SWIFT comes out and tell everyone that they have partnered with ripple.
I can see the faces of all delusionals in here and reddit and butthurttalk.

https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-standard-chartered-axis-bank/The good news keeps coming.... https://ripple.com/insights/ripple-powered-instant-payment-services-now-live-axis-bank-rakbank-standard-chartered/many seem to be using ripple net the technology however, we have yet to see when XRP will be used!!!
Can't cripple the Ripple
I like it
Once SBI and Cualix start intensively using XRP and the escrow will take place things will start moving.
It is a little sad that XRP doesn’t make 2x jumps a week, but we‘ll get there.
Patience is key
SBI seems amuch better choice it seems Cualix is a small Co may be one man?
Should have seen biz when xrp took many people on a moon mission.
It was glorious
