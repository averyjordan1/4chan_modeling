Ask him in the Telegram if you don't believe me.
Look at the chart.
Look at the market cap.
Look at the steadily rising volume.
It's a project that fills a niche.
Do your own research.
Only on EtherDelta.

Pilot here, this is stupid.
Pilots not having the experience they say they do is fairly common but it also isn't a huge safety issue since they still have to go through the same company training everyone does.
this might be the absolute biggest shitcoin ive ever seen in my life.
why does the need a token LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODNWLDIWLDKLWKD
Also, from the whitepaper it sounds like they don't have a solid plan for token use cases.
They just have an erc20 right now cause>fund muh idea
Prove it.
Admittedly I have no idea about the merit of the business at all.
But they obviously feel there's a hole, and they have a solid team and partnerships.With that market cap and a guaranteed Binance listing, it's a no brainer.
