anybody have thoughts about this shitcoin?
bought the ico, sold at 1500, rebought at 225
i played the games on their site and they are very fun
Look at the supply and every year their developers will sell 1 Billion FUN.
They will be selling 1B FUN starting january 2018, so good luck.
Is that a good thing
Bought a decent position @ 222
Been holding since ICO and bought some more anywhere from 200~400 sats, although even from 400 sats the value of BTC wasn't as it is now so the USD value isn't down that much.
When it moons in a few months we'll be laughing.
