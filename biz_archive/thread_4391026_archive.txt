I'm dying to put my BCC gains into something.
RNS
Bittrex/Binance only please
NLG & FTC
POWR
Low-cap EtherDelta alert: ELTcoin.
Research and get in, rocket is already on the final countdown.
Easy 5x
VIA.
Segwit, LN, atomic swaps and Styx.
Already on Ledger.
It is Vertcoin's smaller brother.
Once Styx is implemented it will moon hard.
Factom.
FCT is fueling up for a moon mission right now.
It's not a 10x.
But I'll be surprised it doesn't double by next week
