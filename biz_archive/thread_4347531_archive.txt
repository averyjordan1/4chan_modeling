Anyone else really hoping link doesn't pump anytime soon so they have maximum accumulation time?
Shoo shoo pajeetlinks.
The meme is stale.
No one cares about this useless ERC20 token.
I need bch to moon then I can buy all the link I want
Basically yeah.
I watched the charts since it was 10k and this is something that has people believing in it, a sleeper in mainstream but solid.
I have 0 at the minute until I can accumulate
im a tech brainlet so idk if its good or not but I got a bit of this just in case since it's shilled so much
If you want to shill a coin it's probably a good idea not to show a person that looks like the village idiot.
