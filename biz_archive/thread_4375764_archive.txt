Who else planning to kys if you don't make it in crypto?
why would you kill yourself like some dumb pleb when you could move to a spic place where cocaine is like 5 bucks a gram and just die slowly there instead.
Totally.
Allnor nothing for me
spic placeI'd rather kms.
yeah but cocaine would be 5 dollars a gram there, you would only have to deal with 1 or 2 spics at most, then just stay inside getting high till you die.
Yeah, must admit that death does seem more appealing than this sort of half-life where the fruits of your labor are taken away and it's totally your fault that you can't get your needs met.
of course im going to kill myself if i dont make it with cryptoim not too worried, i have more money than my parents at this point, as long as i dont fuck up big time i should 100% be set by 2020on the off chance that this technology isn't as groundbreaking as i believe it is, and it ends up going to 0, then fuck yeah im killing myself, i cant live on this shit planet wageslaving for 40 years to live a mediocre life when i've had a taste of being rich and better than everyone else
Nahbut we'll make it don't worrygame development with unity is also a good way to make money easily (but you need an easy concept when ur a beginner)
Game dev is my plan B if crypto fails.
how is that easy?
game development is super complicated and indie games grows more and more oversaturated every year.
it's not too hard, its all on youtube, you just need time to learn itcome up with a unique concept and it's the only one of its kind in the entire world
It's not.
He probably threw a few assets together in unity, wrote 3 lines of script and now thinks he's a game dev.
I have 5 years to do it or i kms
WTF are you me.
I've 5 years till 30.
