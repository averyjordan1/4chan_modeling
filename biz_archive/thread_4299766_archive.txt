I only have one question.Was it possible before Bitmex to trade Ethereum with 50x margin?
how about Bitcoin Plus on Poloniex?Because back in March when those coins were worth jackshit.
You could have caught the bullrun spike and made your money+100x50 gains.
About 5000x gainsBecause let's see ETH raised from 10-20$ to 380$ before it dipped to 200$ and returned to 300$.That's around 16-38x gains plus 50-100x from the margin equaling a sum beyond your wildest dreams.
Especially considering these are high volume coins, compared to the shit you see on Cryptopia.Did we just miss the greatest chance to become 100-500 millionaires?
or even billionaires?
You have no idea op, were just getting started.Were not even 0.5% there yet.But implying we can shoot to 5% quick coming 2018 though.
How do we master the margin trading, anonymous?
Us poorfags need to eat too.
Dude you can't calculate it like that, of course there are a few moments in time where that 50x could net you millions, but ETH and BTC went sideways for a long time, if they only dipped to 2% below your entry you would have been fucked, also don't assume you wouldn't cash out after making 10x profit and seeing it dip hard the first time.
Yeah but one correct entry and you're scott-free.
The coin will never go back to the floor it once was 3 years ago.
