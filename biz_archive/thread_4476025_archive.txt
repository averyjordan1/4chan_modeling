Bitcoin Gold just hit the Bittrex market.
I'd suggest you guys get in before the normies see the friendly Bitcoin name.
Just a friendly heads up.
I don't want your shitcoin bags anon
made a nice %20 swing-trading this.
thanks anon!
I sold at .04, I missed the pump to .07 or whatever it was earlier.. fuggI probably fucked up right
Its on the down side now, making another climb up.
If you buy some do it fast, this thing jumps about 200 in 5 minutes right now.
