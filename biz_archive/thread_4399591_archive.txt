Can't you see that this is the future /biz/?
Why haven't you been accumulating below ICO price?
Don't you see the appeal of a decentralized, fee-free exchange for big spenders?
Don't you see how Novogratz is going to shepherd his rich hedge fund friends onto this platform next year?
Don't you know an A+ team when you see one?
Didn't you notice the huge price spike when the main Hong Kong exchanges mentioned that they would be implementing an "unnamed" p2p platform to avoid Chinese regulation?
Didn't you notice how the founders always avoided mentioning how their platform would help corporations avoid regulations during the cnbc interviews?
It's almost too late.
Don't say that I didn't warn you.
I love you guys and I want you on the moon with me.
