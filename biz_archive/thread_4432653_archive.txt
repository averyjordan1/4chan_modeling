pretty big, Da Hong is also an advisor, they plan to integrate it in the NEO ecosystem.
While other people have been buying NEO I've been slowly accumulating LRC and GAS.

I know most people don't listen here, but please connect the dots.Read this: https://medium.com/@rackytwo/loopring-is-the-hidden-gem-amidst-the-neo-news-b1969de76c7eAnd look at the NEX website: https://neonexchange.org/Don't you think that the NEO countdown is now obvious?

biz will fall for scams and miss genuine moonies
Is this a scam or a moon
This reminds me of when I saw gas at its lowest right next to its fucking first boom and I DIDNT FUCKING BUY even though I knew just the relation to NEO would drive its price up tremendously.
Never again.
NEO is the future and will surpass ETH eventually and will take GAS, LRC, ETP, and any other shitcoins associated with it to cloud 9 of chink magic.
Accumulating LRC and GAS after the NEO announcement is the best thing you will do.
A bit late for NEO but get your LRC now!

Spics and niggers need to hang from trees.
"Everything you are saying is offensive to me.

After all, we are all one universal race.
