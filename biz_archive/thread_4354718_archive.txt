Why would you want people like Mike in the game.
Now Mike is telling all his hedge fund friends how he makes huge gains every month and they will want to get on board.
Then everything will become regulated and boring and stupid as white Jew money takes over the scene.
but that's when buttcoins are hundreds of thousands of dollars and i get to stop coming here.
By the time that all happens you will have made so much money off of btc and reinvested it in moon-bound altcoins that you won't even give a shit.Oh wait, did you sell your btc for bch?
Or are you not here to make money?Buy Monero faggot.
People don't realize that BTC's price was acting directly proportional to how BCH was doingHow did nobody else get this?
Bullish as fuck.
Wall Street pension funds are going to flood the crypto market soon
corecucks dont give a fuck about this
His firm & Stansberry Churchouse are probably putting in millions into ETH right now too.
What a fucking week.
Penis head doesnt realise that he is the herd!!
Wait, so does this mean that when money moves out of BCH and back into BTC we might actually hit new ATHs immediately?
