The theory here is that people liquidate their holdings in order to buy christmas presents or on-sale items.
As crypto NEETs, you can rest assured none of us have anyone for whom we are buying presents.
The "bachelor sales" of alibaba proves your wrong as millions of chinks neets rushed for online sales.I just make a statement : bitcoin is going to crash badly on black friday, then it is going to recover only to crash again just before christmas
