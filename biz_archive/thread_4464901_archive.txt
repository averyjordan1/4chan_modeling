Hey /biz/ I spent all weekend talking to normies about blockchain.Right now we are at the point where (From what I can tell) normie college students know about bitcoin (and some even know about Ethereum!)
but they rarely know how to acquire it or what the differences between cryptos are.
Furthermore, I have yet to meet anyone who knows what a smart contract is.
This bubble is just beginning :)
I head some normie say he would buy 1 NEO at the gym, they have no idea what they are doing.
Saw a blogger that said: ''how to get rich of bitcoin with €1,50'' And then he litterly explained that all you needed to do was invest €1,50 for the longterm into Bitcoin (made around 2016)
thanks for the blood sweat and tears boots-on-the-ground consumer research field work anon
