If I use a offline wallet to store my crypto bags what happens if my hard drive crashes?
Would my coins be lost to the void?
Is there a way to back up crypto to a flash drive or something?
If your hard drive dies in such a way that you can't retrieve anything from it then your coins are lost forever.
Wallets can be easily backed up, just transfer the wallet file to a flash drive, or CD (the exact files are different for each wallet.
If you have an electrum wallet, all you really need to save is your 12 word seed)
Your coins are actually out there on the block chain, not on your computer.
What you are essentially storing is your "private key".
Your private key is what lets you access the block chain and say "yes, these coins are mine and I can do what I want with them.
"If you set up your wallet with a 12 word seed, make sure you have that written down somewhere that is NOT on the computer (write it on a piece of paper and keep it somewhere very safe)Also if you know your private key, you can write that down too.
That easy?
Just copy and paste the files over to a flash drive and it's safe n sound (provided no one steals your flash drive)
Yes.
Like I said, google exactly which files you need to transfer for your wallet.However, a better option is to write down your 12 word seed or your private keys.
There are numerous ways to ensure your wallet is safely backed up.
For example, you could print out your public and private keys on a piece of paper and safe that somewhere.
Or take a picture of your public and private key QR codes and print that out.
You could also practice on an empty wallet of some shitcoin you have 0 of, if you're worried you might fuck it up.
