Just got out of all crypto holdings, risk/reward gone from low risk/high return to high risk/low return.I'm going to wait till the dust settles.Anyone got any good ideas?Also, will never hold ETH again, propaganda from morons and commies doesn't give me confidence
yeah, enjoy your gains and dont come crying when bitcoin hits $10k
I'll not be crying, I'll get back in when stability returns and on the dip and I can long on my trading account if action looks good.In terms of longer term holding my confidence is down, fiat gives me more options right now
