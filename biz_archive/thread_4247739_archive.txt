Wich exchanges you guys use?
Fucking Bittrex wont allow me to withdraw my money, but the real problem is their absolute dogshit support.
13 days and still no answer.
I've heard poloniex and binance are garbage too, so whats left?
Fucking Bittrex wont allow me to withdraw my moneySame here.changed their verification requirements without notice and wont accept my verifcation.
Support is non existant, so I'll have to file them under Scam.Kraken has not fucked me over so far, so their a bit above bittrex, but generally, all of the exchanges suck.
Use Coss
Oh, and the decentralized waves exchange is quite underrated I think, but they of course have the issue that they only have very few non-waves tokens and coins available.
There's not a 'great' exchange out there considering the massive amount of capital that's running around itGemini is pretty top notch but they only trade BTC and ETH, Kraken has abysmal trade server issues, Bittrex is terribly unpredictable, Binance is a chinese honeypot and Bitfinex is gonna crash the cryptomarket with no survivors with their antics
Yeah, my account has enhanced status, but 0 btc withdraw limit, as if I didn't have stress enough daily trading, now this.
I still can use m money there, but I can't move to other placesI've see some anons recommend this one, I'm gonna take a look
Coinbase and Kraken to deposit fiat.
Had no problem getting Tier 3 verified on Coinbase but Kraken are fucking me around a bit.
Otherwise mostly Bitfinex and Binance.
Wich one do you use tho?
I use Kraken
