I got a shit paying 20 hours job a week I can't leave (because it's not a proper job but a goverment contract).
Thankfully it runs out in 8 months.What can I do on the side in the meantime?
I can't actually get a real part tim because this shit is artificial precarity.I have a car, a large van I can use to transport junk (outdated efficiency so no regular trips for minimal profit), a bunch of gardening and gilding chemicals, some gardening tools and a bunch of woodworking tools, a small coal forge, my knowledge of english (non anglo) and my whits.I probably can't sell on a regular flea market without a permit because the guys in this area are very, very possessive about their spots.
