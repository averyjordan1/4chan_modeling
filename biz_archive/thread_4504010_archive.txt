There isn’t some mystery as to why these fucking orders happen.
Chances are you’ve done it yourself and didn’t even fucking notice.ALL these are are somebody placing order price/quantity in the wrong boxes.
Not usually a big deal if you’re buying but you can lose a lot of your fuck up selling thousands of coins for less than an eth.
Nope.
Someone manually clicked the highest order, clicked the confirm button again to make that trade.
What you're talking about is when someone puts a high buy order and bots take it instantly.
