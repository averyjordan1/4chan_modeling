If LINK/REQ is so awesome, why does the rest of the crypto world view it as poison?
Serious answers.
No FUD/Shill.
Explain good logical points.
My take is that people aren't buying what they are selling in terms of what they set out to do.
These coins will only be valuable when they actually show something.
Why does the rest of the crypto world view it as poison?They don.t'/thread
They don.t'That makes no sense to me.
Because if they did the price wouldn't be this low and it wouldn't dip all the time.
Fudding Link is a meme

I really wish people would watch it.
No FUD just research.
