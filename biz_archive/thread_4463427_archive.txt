Seriously I thought everyone knew this.
What's this rubbish about Solar and such?
Going to be a buy call for VTC pushing it up to $10-12, and we'll see around $20 before the halving, then a drop to $15-16 climbing steadily back to $20-$25 range in the months that follow.If you don't make money off this you're either too impatient to make money off crypto (literally less than a month for 3x ROI) or too stupid to research and find obvious picks.
Either way you don't deserve it if you don't take this opportunity.
Hugely undervalued coin, will certainly be 10-20x in 12 months, and would already be at $8 if there wasn't so much attention on the BTC/BCH situation.Don't get cucked this time anon.
I will fork vertcoin and bitcoinereum: Vertcoinereum.
I had a conservative target of $8 EOY but if PBC gets behind this and the halving I could definitely see this cracking a billion dollar market cap.
Wish PBC would kinda fuck off, I'm not done accumulating this
common knowledge tbqh
Yep, slowly transferring most of my portfolio to VTC, been mining it for the past 3 months.
Feeling super comfy
VTCGRS is similar, yet 5 times cheaper.
THATS the real opportunity.GRS mcap is 40m, VTC is 170.
What is first mover advantage?
Theres a reason bitcoin is worth more than litecoin.
They're both a good opportunity for ez gains.
Why not hold both?
I'm mining with 200mh, switched over from eth a month ago.
We will have to see what the halvening brings.
Dec 12, was it?
