Bagholding from 600 editionSome whale with apparently bottomless pockets is screaming like a madman in binance:>THIS IS THE FLOOR NOW, FUCKERSIt's kind of funny because it's a script and there aren't any walls at that price, but he just instabuys anything below 435.
The candles are minuscule with wicks all over the place.
all that matters is that NEO actually HAS a respectable, solid floor.
it's never going to zero.
where crypto goes, so will NEO.
NEO will ALWAYS keep a certain % of the bitcoin price.
This I am sure of.
So a win for BTC is a win for NEO.
etc.
I dont even check the price.
Just sit comfy 100% in neo generating comfy gas
Yup, last pump made it perfectly clear for me.

Stupid tweet made it go all the way to mars.
When there's actual good news it'll probably stay way up
