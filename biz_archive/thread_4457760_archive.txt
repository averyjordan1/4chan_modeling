Is confido really over?
It was over 80 percent of my portfolio.
I only had about 2k of it overall but I don't ever have much.
Can it ever recover from this?
I just wanted to get out of shitty home situation, and then this happens.
I honestly feel like I should just kill myself at this point, that's how broken I feel right now.
I guess it's just my fault for being a retard and not listening to the idea of not spending what you can't lose.
I'm at the end of my rope here.
