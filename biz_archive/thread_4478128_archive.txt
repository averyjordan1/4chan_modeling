How low is the BTC gonna dip?
is 7800 buy order?
Setting my buys for 7700 and hopefully people won't realize this means absolutely nothing before then
7700.do NOT put buy orders for 7800.
Pre april price.
$700
No dude, not this time.
Sit and wait for a day or two

Nothing has actually happened though.
None of those tethers are going to get anywhere now that they've been flagged in that wallet
not the shittiest meme lines I've ever seen
m is nothing and people are feeding off eachothers panic, give it 24 hours then buy.
Since people will start realising that it means absoluteley nothing to the market
Funny thing is it's so fucking obvious that Tether is going to come back online and anyone who panic sold will lose money.This is an easy "buy the dip" moment if I've ever seen one.
But watch /biz/ panic like a retard and sell again and then post more "what's going on why's it going back up???"
threads in a few days.
The Tether thing is a distraction and is just there to accelerate the correction.
BTC is simply correcting.
It's normal... but it will go down to the level I posted above.
I'm going to be up all night watching the price in case we have a super dump.
Great.
I only trade ETH at this point anyway because BTC barely fucking moves but still carries risk.
Is there any actual proof that this dip has anything to do with tether>BTC goes up>MUH TETHER>BTC goes down>MUH TETHERMUH TETHER
It literally started to tank the moment the Tether news came out.
It's obvious
RIP btc.
Run for your lives.
