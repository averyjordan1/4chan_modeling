fake big T is fakenice try tho OP
POWR is holding up quite well against the current alt drain
This company should be doing government paperwork so they pass regulations by 2020 instead of paying pajeets to shill on 4chan
Check the plates.Powr bagholders acting real desperate.
Scam company.
Stole funds (check for yourself).
Did one of the worst AMA's in world history (via Telegram, absolutely disgusting).
Enjoy your PowerBags.
next PBC CoinI don't think anybody gives a fuck at this point.
I think we've moved past PBC.
What's your point with this picture?
That a Mercedes SLR has "SLR" in the plate?
This picture has nothing to do with the POWR team.
This picture has nothing to do with the POWR team.Sure.Just like POWR has absolutely nothing to do with this month's PBC report.But that pic related has.
moved where tho?
I thought pbc pick was pink coin
Nice desperate FUD.I know quite well SLR, here (in Italy) this shitcoin is known from 2-3 years, they give it to people that use solar panels.A friend of mine has green house powered by solar panels, got this shitcoins and totally forgot about them.
He didn't even know they have a value, I told him about /biz/ shill and he would totally suck you dry to thank you.But we're here to talk business, so stop with this SLR bullshit, the pick is POWR.Now around 3500 sats it's a deal.
