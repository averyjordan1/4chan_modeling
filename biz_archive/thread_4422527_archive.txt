hahahahahahahahaha good luck with that my dude
no, you are not.You are going to wait until the coin hits CMC at which point will 4x in the first couple of days on ED then dump all your tokens, change to XMR and make a quick 100k on the backs of newbies who dont know any betterFuck you, Fuck you and fuck you
Is it even possible to fork an ERC20 token?

Thanks for airdropping, OP.
These /biz/ airdrops have paid well for me recently.
This coin seems like it's got winning potential and I'm glad to have a stake in shilling it.
>not buying eARK instead
Did you try the new token out?
Does it solve the oracle problem?
I'm waiting for it to arrive to 0xD4470F081a5ECC6b6258c3427eF5D1110D38e7c9 so that I can evaluate it.
I think it could be the true solution to the Oracle problem, though.
