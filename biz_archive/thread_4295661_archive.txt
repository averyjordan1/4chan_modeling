Why can't you make money?
Maybe if you joined this discord and worked up the ranks, you could https://discord.gg/NKhHtfU
Nice try Vizard
Because that's extremely illegal, and there's permanent records of everything you're doing.
Now that more and more average people are getting into crypto, regulations will not be far behind.
All it takes is you skinning the sheep one too many times and getting a lot of SEC reports filed about your group.
extremely?
really?
tell me more about the 20 days I will spend in prison.
You're assuming he's telling the truth.
He's the organizer of the group to begin with.
Every single one of these PnD groups are absolute shams.
move your money through monero
really?
then why did I profit 40% in the first pump after joining and inviting 20 people to the group?https://discord.gg/NKhHtfU
There will still be a record of you buying monero
I joined their sub and they literally had no organization or knowledge.Their "pump" was shilling so other niggas buy instead of actually buying themselves which they can't do because pajeetpoor.
If he's the organizer of the group, then everything I said is just as applicable.
I don't think you understood what I implied.It's not the money records that are a problem, it's the records of him engaging in conspiracy to defraud investors.
And at some point he has to transfer a crypto to an exchange to buy some of these garbage coins.
at some point he has to transfer a crypto to an exchange to buy some of these garbage coins.And that's when I make all of my money.
