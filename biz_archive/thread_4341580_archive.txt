Every once in awhile, there comes a project that is so exciting that it sends shivers down my spine.
My hands... Are literally shaking right now...
I just got to know about ETP 3 days ago and have been doing my research on it.
What I discovered was...
Absolutely crazy out of this world potential.
Leader, technology, team, it all checks out.
ONLY thing that didn't check out is its current price.
I just went all in at $3.
There is no better time to buy than now.
I am afraid we will never see this price again.
