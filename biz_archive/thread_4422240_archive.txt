Well what you arkies waiting for?
Buy it all up with all your pay checks
Are you saying the sell wall is low?I might buy another 1,000
Can someone explain to me how these "walls" work?
All I know about these graphs is it's basically a supply (red) and demand (green).
But I don't understand the "walls" terminology.
I'm fucking in the red overall, it just starts to go up and I'm green again, then I see this shit pop up.I'm fucking butthurt.
I bought all I wanted when I thought prices were going to start rising.These cunt whale bastards will put up a giant sell wall no one can buy then keep accumulating cheap coins with the suppressed price.
>only have 3300 Ark>no more disposable fundsJUST
Oh I see.
So basically they put up their coins (a fuck ton of them) for ludicrous prices and then when no one buys, the price tanks then they scoop it up at low price and run a pump and dump?
Yepp.
Fortunately it's on Binance now so the manipulation isn't as bad, but it's still there
I wish I had more spare btc to put into this too.If anyone is interested in ark they would probably be well-served buying this.
It might fluctuate a little bit but any moment now is going to be slow waves up until it's moon mission in a few weeks.
So can the manipulation "ripple" out to other exchanges even if the other exchanges don't necessarily have the wall?
