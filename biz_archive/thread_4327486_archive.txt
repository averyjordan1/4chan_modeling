Weekend PnD asideDos BCH have any long term value?
No but ride the waves while you can
gavin andresen supports bch>vitalik implicitly endorses bch>all segwit2x supporters endorse bch>adam back acting like a toddlerSegwit2x was a lie and a build up to this shitshow.
You're witnessing one of the greatest chess moves in financial history.I am in Ethereum but if BTC Core somehow wins this fight adam back needs to be dismissed
mfw real 144D chess
bch is the real bitcoin.
bcore is trying to use scotch tape to glue side chains and try to get more transactions off the blockchain and fail miserably.
right now it would require 160 mined blocks to clear the mempool and of course that won't happen with just 1 block mined every 10 minutes.with no block size limit, in theory just one block would clear the mempool
Both have big problems ahead.
