Which alts should I buy on Monday?
You're looking at it
Deluded
Everyone should be accumulating ARK.
arkie
this is the perfect coin for HODL memersyou get more just for holding
I don't own ARK.
But this BCH/BTC drama is going to be good for coins that have established communities to make their case in the next month/two.
I don't get it.
Why aren't miners moving to something like ARK that connects everything?They could make at least 1000x profit.
If you're genuinely not baiting:ark can't be mined.
its DPOS as opposed to bitcoin which is POW.Also if everyone moves over to another coin, the difficulty adjusts and they're back in the same boat.
explain plz.
does more ark just show up in your wallet?
first movers would get profit though.
Depending on how quickly the difficulty adjusts, yes.However, more and more coins seem to be going the way of ASIC resistant mining or POS.
Hence you can't really move your asic miner farm over to a random coin and get rich.
That's the main reason large players in the mining scene just keep jumping between bch and btc.
We'd need more "multiple small fish" type delegates, like biz_classic to form and push "few big whale" delegates off from a forging position.
However, it sort of also means that whales, like with BCH/BTC pump & dump, relinquish their mechanisms for mining if they dump.
