How about you mention your USP, or your target customer - ya know, give us something to create a name that actually increases your chances of converting interest into customers?
"nomies" is vague as fuck.
Are we talking" young, old, ethnic, high or low socio economic class?Are you offering fast returns, passive investing, regular reports and consultancy... hell, do you have a logo, or any other brand identity already developed that we can leverage into a relevant name?Hint: if you could express what is special about your business in one sentence you would have gotten responces.
