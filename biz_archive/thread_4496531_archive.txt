how are people predicting that bitcoin will go up to 100k?
that literally doesn't make any sense.
it will be dropped for a cheaper currency well before 50k, because your average normie won't think they'll make money off of it anymore.
the thing about crypto is that the appeal is to make money, so as the price goes up, the buy in from normies is less and less.
this is a simple fact you'll have to face
That doesn't make any sense.
Because the normie only knows Bitcoin.
If they still only know Bitcoin when it's at 50k then they will still only be buying Bitcoin.it's a simple fact you'll have to face
bitcoin has a greater chance of going to $100 a coin than $50,000
No.
The point of crypto is for Vladimir Putin to hide his money from the Americans.
when you're older you'll understand
this sadly people can't see it tho
I'm all in on ETH due to it's the cheaper attractive option on normiebase.
>Shit, BTC is 12k but what's this ETH is only 600 right here next!
If I buy now I will get original BTC returns!
Normie buys ETH thus pump my ETH that I bought for 200.
Rinse and repeat until I sense the bubble and cash out.
bitcoin at 8k doesn't make sense either dummyanything is a guess
People will just start talking in mBTCs instead of BTCs.
