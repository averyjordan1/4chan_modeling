Im about to buy 300 worth of BTC and 300 worth of LTC.
Is $6650 BTC and $59.80 LTC low enough for me to buy or should I wait and save a few dollars???
Dont wanna be holding the bag if BTC goes to 5k or less..
Litecoin sits around ~$50 - 55 usually.
I wouldn't touch BTC, it's dropped $1000 already, it's dead.
LTC
LTC has segwit tho, that graphic is wrong.
fud.
kill yourself
no u
K i just bought LTC at $59.30.
I guess its better than the people who got it at 67 last night kek.
