Bought awhile back, didn't sell when it hit $5.00.
Thinking about selling now and buying back in before the halving in December.
Thoughts?
if you're in profit sell, if you're losing money hodl
Hard to tell when this will moon again.
I day trade to accumulate more but I don't like leaving open orders for too long.
It may go down for a bit, or it may spike up out of the blue... crypto gonna crypto.
I'm banking on this hitting $100+ long term so anything at this price is cheap af
 If there id anythong that could hit 100 it's litecoin.
10 might be a more reasonable valuation.
THESE BAGS ARE HEAVY ANONS
HEY FAGS, IF IT PEAKS AGAIN BEFORE THE FORK, SHOULD I SELL OUT THEN BUY BACK AND TAKE MY CHANCES TO BUY IN WHEN IT IS LOW?
OR AM I A DUMB NIGGER?
i would sell and try to buy back in
it's going up as we speak
It will rise a bit until halving and then it will drop for two monthsAfter the drop you will see a big pump
It is Mooning faggots, BUY BUY!
Just fucking go to 4.30
Yeah good idea, sell low and buy high later on.
FUCK I sold too earlysomeone put a huge fake sell wall and I went out
RSI is under 60 still don't fucking sell god dammit, this could go to 5 for all we know!
I think it's over now soon
Yep, its over now, sell that and wait untill it goes down in the 3.90 range again.
put in a sell order at 55
