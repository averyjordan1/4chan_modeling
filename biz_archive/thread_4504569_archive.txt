I'm only gonna post this once, buy Cardano (ADA) while it's still low, they are only listed on Bittrex but they are mainly aiming for the Asian market.
Basically, this coin will pump whenever it hits an Asian exchange.
calls itself the Ada crypto currency>programmed in Haskell
Sure, it's a solid team of ex ETH/ETC people abd they use Haskell, which is niceBut why would it griw faster than BTC?It's not a utility coin afaik
It has pretty significant potential seeing as how it is building a reputation as being one of (if not the only) "scholarly" crypto with their ongoing research.
This leads to a longer term hold but their content released so far is fascinating.
e.g.
: https://iohk.io/research/papers/#9BKRHCSIRegarding future pumps, if it hits an asian exchange it will grow quickly in value because it was initially marketed and sold to asian investors.
IIRC this was done because US regulations made it difficult and Asia (especially Japan where it was heavily sold) are areas of tech innovation that are thirsty for more crypto smart contract projects.
Thanks for explaining, I'm a brainlet.
