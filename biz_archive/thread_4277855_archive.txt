Is day trading crypto feasible?
If so why don't I see any posts about it?
Is day trading too much of a meme in general?
I used to with Bitcoin.
Tx fees too high.
I day trade alts to accumulateProbably could make more taking 1 good entry point and holding until 1 good exit pumpI feel its too risky though so I take profit as I can, try to get 100k sats every 2 weeks (try to)Im thinking of getting a portgolio as I dont have all day to tradeBut I dont want to be JUST'd by a BTC bull run
Because anyone who's not retarded uses a bot on the major exchanges.
And they would never talk about it here.
And yes, I do know 100k sats is only 7bucksI dont have much in crypto and I dont take much risk
