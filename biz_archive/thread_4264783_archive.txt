Hey guys,I run an eCommerce company.
Its doing good, Its just me and my friend and we pull in 20-30k a month in revenue.
That probably breaks down to about $5000-$6000.00 in profit a month.
Its a good amount considering we are stacking up every month.
But I use $2000.00 for rent and basic needs not to really pay myself.
I am in the process of building another company and working a npo out to get paid but its taking a minute.
I have some free time mostly but I need to make that $2000.00+ a month, so I can make the business grow faster.
What would you guys propose ?I was thinking of an online remote job but I wasn't too sure on how legit those companies are .
Anyone have any experience?
Whats the market?
or can I see the product?
