Put in 1k.
Don't be a pussy.
Bitconnect goes up with the price of Bitcoin.
If you think Bitcoin isn't going to go up any higher, then don't put money in.
If you think Bitcoin hasn't come close to its ATH, put money in.
The ride can't go on forever but why not profit while you can.
There's no trading bot, but if you're black guy with huge amount of subs on youtube, you've got a chance!
this is all on par with what i've heard about it.he said "throw 500 at it and see what happens, i think you'll do well with it"anons are saying 0-1000
ponzi schemejust buy bitcoin instead
I threw $100 in on 10/22/17, I didn't use anybody's bullshit sign up links either.. in less than a month I've made $30 of it back
Throw me 500 and see what happens, I'll give you 50% daily
Top bantz
it's just how this works man the more you put in the more you get back on a regular basis it's nothing scammy just logical.
only niggers shill this OP.think about that.
oh yeah man 1% average gains every day, totally sustainable man

Who gives a shit.
I've doubled my investment already in it and got it all withdrawn to BTC.
Every day that goes by I make more and more money.
Stay poor
