Continuing from my pass 2 threads.
There was an announcement even though it was late..
But it wasn't anything much.
Luckily enough my sell order was hit about 10 hours ago.This ain't going anywhere till late Friday or Saturday morning.
For those buying now, good luck.
You've got balls to buy during a downwards trend.
My balls are as heavy as my qsp bags.
Fuck me
get out pajeets or you'll regret.
the run was fun but time to move on.don't say i didn't warn you
Why take the effort to write this?
Fud all you want during your accumulation.
Nobody'll believe you
But..
But...
But... Visa is going to use qsp.. And it will be listed on bittrex!

I have no clue what you're talking about.
Fudding would require me to talk shit about a coin.Quite sure that news wasn't released by Richard Ma, or anyone in the team.
This downwards trend is gonna be awhile, buckle down if you bought high.It's gonna be a bumpy road.
