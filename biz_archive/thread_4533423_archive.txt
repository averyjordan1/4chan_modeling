BTG has already been deposited into bitthumb account holders.
It's been confirmed on telegram/slack already by a korean user.

link telegram

it just got listed
http://index.bithumb.com/coinsdaq/index.php?coin=BTG
oh shit, dumped 5% in the first hit, should we bail?
Fucking dump.
Btg is kill
its $700 on bithumbjust wait a bit
This is going to be either an epic moon or another BCH grade rekening.BTG is GPU mineable anon, a single 1080ti can pull $4/day.
Shit is going places long term.
Why is that?
How long til this price hits other exchanges?
Redpillme
I don't think thats how it works.
Please elaborate sempai
Check bithumb
so is every other shitcoin anon.
Sooo send your BTG to bithumb and sell for 3x?
or wait for the arbitrage to even the price upwards?
Yeah I'm that noob.
either one
Too scared of using a Korean exchangeI think I will wait til Bithumb shows up under Markets on BTGs CMC price.
Once that happens it should skyrocket on CMC therefore on the other exchanges.
My theory.
Anyone knows how the phone format works for non korean users on bithumb?
need it for registration.
wanna dump gold ASAP.
$4 a dayamazing.
