What's the best long term hold for 2018?I'm thinking of investing 20 grand % BTC% Monero% LinkThoughts?
>btckek
100% BTC
>trying to be subtle with your link shillingvery clever
drop monero for eth imo
HURRR LINK?
DUDE LMAO DEM MEMES DOE HAHAHAHA, LINK?
CMON MAN, LINK?
GIMME A BREAK DUDE LMAOstay poor you cocksucker, just because /biz/ made a meme out of Link it doesn't take anything away from the project potential
no eth?
any reasons why?also, consider investing in the index of the last 10-20 coins rather than a few good picks and rebalance every one or two months maybe.
If you are of average intelligence or above, you would go %100 Monero.
BCH ftw
I meant first 10-20 coins of course.
