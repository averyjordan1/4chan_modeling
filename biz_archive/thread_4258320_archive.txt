That blessed anon made me a nice stack with the hot tip yesterday, but I still have no idea what this coin is.
The website is terrible and generic.Anyone know what its about?
It takes a lot of disparate connecting for a westerner to put it together it seems, but from what I habe gathered they provide customizable backends in the form of side chains to chinese enterprise.
There are aspects of neo in that it can be a platform, aspects of walton, as they provide supply chain logistics, and aspects of ven as they provide an anticounterfeiting protocol.
All of those features are already present in their parent chain.Partnered with inchain already.They have some kind of deal with a huge chinese payroll and accounting firm.
Nuls is unironically Walton coin 2.0
Goddamn!
The gains won't stop!
