I made a fuck up wth paypal and now im $800 in paypal debt.
I just want t know what they will do to me if i never pay them back?
lmao how did it happen?
He got chargebacked probably
OP here, my older brother got onto my paypal and bought a par of shoes from stockX.
He wont pay me back and im not working right now so i cant pay back
report it to paypal and have him arrested for fraudthey will send you to collections, ruin your credit for life, and my friend actually had a detective come to his house over something similar
One thing is im moving to a new house in one week, my old address is on my paypal.
will that help at all?
