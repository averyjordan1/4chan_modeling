Should Indian IP addresses be banned from /biz/?
we just need flags tbqh desu
How will we call anyone promoting coins we dont like pajeets then?
This desuI'm sick of americans and I have a script that lets me filter them if there are flagst.american
YEs.
I bet we'll find out there are almost no Indians here after we put the flag.On flag enabled boards we don't see them.
daily reminder that most pajeet ethnic groups are caucasians and were the first caucasians to develop an advanced society
No one should be banned but I would be strongly for adding flags to /biz/
Wants to ban Indians>Uses Adolf Hitler picGo read more history, anon
Indians have infected the globe.
Pajeets are everywhere and cannot be contained with flags.
