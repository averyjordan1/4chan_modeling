How hard is it to pass the CPA exam?
It's really easy.
If you can't pass it then you are a moron and you should reconsider your future.
The hardest part is being enough of a faggot to take it in the first place.
But it looks like you're well on your way.
Unless you're a Gook, Nigger or Rag Head you shouldn't have a problem passing
Gook, Nigger or RagDo shitskins really have trouble with the cpa.
I don't understand why we allow them in the white man's world.
hey anon, I'm guessing you're majoring in accounting, what's it like?I've been considering doing finance/accounting as my major but I'm not sure yet and I want to know more.
what's it like?chewing glass and staring into the abyss.
Look at what the classes are like on ocw.mit.edu.
If I did that I would have never majored in finance.
