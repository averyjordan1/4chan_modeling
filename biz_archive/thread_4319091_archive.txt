A fortune of $200 lying around to spend.
Which coins (except BTC or BCC) should I put it into?
Daytrade ETH and Monero for a while, get into BTC if it hits 4900 or 6700.
If it's at 6700, then it means the previous value is safe.
If it hits 4900, it won't fall any lower.
To clarify: I already have BTC and BCC.
I'm looking for suggestions to play around and maybe hatch something nice out of it.
