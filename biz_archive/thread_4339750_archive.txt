ARE YOU READY????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I am
Yes please.
I've been a good boy, pls comp.
me 2
Oh boy the things I would do if this hit 1k this year
Yes please!
Honestly believe that XMR will be 0.1 BTC before you know it
price speculation for next few days?
XMR is a good long term currency, i hope it doen't go through the roof too fast.
I like it when it has some natural looking growth and not these extremes that dont last.
Just woke up wtf happens with this overnight?
BTC happened.
Look at DASH too.
Everything is turbulent and Monero is still the most secure way to send money or receive money.
It will probably hit $130 as we go through the next week or two.
Could even have a rally to a new baseline.
The month to month shows the general trend and it looks like it should perform well.
Idk about 1k, but $200 is feasible in the near future.
BTC holders looking for alternatives as the future of their coin isn't looking so good atm.
Of course it's all speculation like always.
Damn wish I would of had my sell order set up
