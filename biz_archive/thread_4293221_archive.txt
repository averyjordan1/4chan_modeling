50k holder here.
Been watching the ETH-COSS pair and it has like 2 trades/hour.
My fear is that if the volume dies too much its less likely big news can save it.
On the bright side no non-COSS pair was ever legit anyway so we're starting from scratch with volume anyway.
Thoughts?
2 New Icos happening on Coss> UI change in November> Free Airdrops> Fee SplitHave a good day.
Beta so volume is low.
1 month old exchangeHow about you wait like 5-6 months before saying its dead?
Shit takes time
k holder here and you should kill your self then sell all your COSS to me, you don't deserve them
