Why are you so bullish on cryptocurrency?Literally we need BIG news in 2018 because these rates of growth are unsustainable.
Something like Amazon accepting bitcoin or some shit.
Unless crypto actually goes mainstream then don't forget you are in a huge bubble and will lose lots of money.
Do you see any game changing big news coming soon?
- CME- Huge fee drop when segwit goes live- No more forks
For amazon to accept BTC it would have to not be an insane and volition internet funnymoney>whoops I just spent $500 on a phone case
unironically, its a disruptive tech to the jewish monopoly on human exchange worldwideeven if some are slow and clunky, they far outway having to be a slave to mr. goldshekelstein
I just don't understand why people are so bullish on BTC, it's just strictly inferior in so many ways to new coins, people saying that they are investing in technology or some bullshit are just plain lying.Gold is at least tangible and has actual uses besides its rarity.Make money on BTC, great that's good for you, but stop deluding yourself that you're some kind of philantropist or wise tech mogul.
Because Bitcoin was the first and it is already legendary and there is cult around Satoshi.
The whole anonymous lone genius who changed the world shit even normies love.
People want to buy real gold not Chinese plastic (alts)
