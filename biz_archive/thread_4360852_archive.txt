Why is literally no-one talking about this new shitcoin?
It was airdropped two days ago and no-one trades it, cares about it, or posts about it.Will exchanges even bother to release it to people who had coins on their accounts?
Seems like nobody gives a damn about this latest tranche of free money.
Found 0.5 of this coin at my broker in my portfolio.
Well thanks for that !
Not sure if its worth anything at all...
>sends hidden transaction fee to the developer
Yea I'm still waiting on my 1.5 btg, I fucking lost $190 trying to day trade bch while it was in falling knife mode lol, I better get reimbursed with that btg
Is there any exchange that takes deposits?
ledger users still haven't been able to get ours.
Because it's literally a shitcoinThe devs are the most retarded ever
wtf bittrex I want my btg
BitcoinCash and BitcoinGold are just shitcoins using bitcoins name to market to idiots.
