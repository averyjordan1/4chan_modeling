hey guys am holding 480 xmr since 85$ , am looking to hold for 2-3 years.
do i have any chance to book 500k$ in 2-3 years from now ?
$500k is too low... $800k is more suitable in that timeframe.
are you being sarcastic ?
yeah probably 500k$ is too optimistic
No clue maybe, I only have 30 myself :/ best of luck
I think that will easily be $200,000
I could see xmr at $1,000 in 3 years.
But I do own a couple...
