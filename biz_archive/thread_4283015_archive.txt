When should someone get in on Monero?
Will it be $300-600 in the next 2 years?
Monero is what Bitcoin should have been.
Private and scalable.So it will have a bright future.
>nigger on the "get started"-videoLiterally a shit coin.
I got shaken the fuck out just now, FUCK THIS MARKET
Possibly right now would be a good time to get in, though no guarantees.It’s a solid coin far less priced by speculators than others.
Instead there’s just a number of people that actually care for its properties.Tends to pump hard every once in a while, but I’m not sure you can time that.
Just buy in at a good price and hold.
You can use it as collateral on polo margins, too, for fueling other trades.
People will flock to it slowly over time.
There should be a small pump for multisig being added to the wallet.
Buy Monero if you want a x3 coin.
Buy Ark if you want a x100.
Pretty hard to time imho but it seems to be related to the development of the coin instead of PnD's.Upcoming events:- Multisig release- Subaddresses- Globlee project- Hardware wallet releaseResearching: faster verification times (bullet), smaller blocksize (graphene, spectre), ...Monero is a bit like an index fund, best if you hold some Monero.The recent rise was the market trying to price in MultiSig and the cancellation and by consequence quick rush into alts now Bitcoin2x has been scapped.I see a potential other price bump at the end of the year/next release.
this sounds like the fucking gold.
Monero at this point no need to be shilled, anyone smart would know $200 for Monero is a sooner or later matter.
