Do you think crypto market will crash in December?Historically there were massive dumps during Christmas time
Right now every BTC dip is bought up by big money.
Only alts are fucked.
nope keep buying high
That's why you sell everything and move your wealth into the heating oil market during that period.
No idea.
I know that accountants of every company and every financial organization make big reports every year.
I think it's good to hide your profits in crypto, so you don't pay too much tax.But I'm not an accountant, maybe, it's the other way around.
I will wait mid december to buy bitcoin.Alts are okay I think (no such wirdraw during this period)
i sure hope so, fuck roger ver and jihan and their loose attempt to take over bitcoin.
my alts are bleeding red and it's just a start fuck
I think alts will probably stagnate, Q1 2018 some of them will pump hard, especially ones that have partnered with major companies, any big news or projects probably wonâ€™t bw announced until after the 1st of the year.
sure, if they meme it.
