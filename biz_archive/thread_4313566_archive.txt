I hope he sold
I recall hearing about some guy selling his house and shit for BTC, wasn't that before that fork?
he bought in super low though I think
At least I'll never be as JUST'D as this guy
If he bought before the fork then he has BCH as well...
do we have hero'ed people in crypto yet?
That's not the point.
i hope he sold at 7,8k kek
Oh god I almost fell out of my chair laughing.
He might still have his split of BCH though.
Thesw articles emerged i think when btc was around 4500Dude was probably on cloud 9 after few months
4313660This was in october, he doesnt have BCC
If he didn't, he might be the biggest bagholder /biz/ has ever encountered.
Just imagine the stress he is in right now
Never bet anything you're afraid you'll lose.
Dis guy dum
Notice how we don't hear from people who sold their BTC at $1.
He is in since 2000$ or so, that is what he said in a Dutch talkshow
just
