Looks like Kraken lost too much on BCH.
Can't login.
Anyone else?
yeah jesus this fucking site is down so often, what a piece of shit.which exchanges stayed up throughout all of the bch madness?
those are the ones i want to trade on
be me two years ago>open up a kraken account>buy eth>move it to offline paper wallet>never log back onto kraken again>open up a binance account>buy link>....
Did Binance?
Bittrex and Cryptopia
any US based exchanges that arent unreliable as shit?
gdax
Binance was down for me, as well as bittrex.
Both unusable.
That site is a technical travesty.
If someone posted "I used Kraken today and was able to make 10 trades without an error", I would just assume it's a troll.
I think only Bitfinex stayed online and it had second highest volume right after bithumb.
kraken always goes down anon, you're only supposed to use it to cash in/out
bitfinex is not for US citizens
