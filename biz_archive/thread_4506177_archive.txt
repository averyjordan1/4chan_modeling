Part of a local utility project now has close to double the market cap Chainlink had at ATH.Let that sink in.
Power ledger: - use case: utility distribution- biggest association: Australian govt.
(indirectly)Chainlink:- use case: mainstream smart contracts- biggest associations: Swift (global network of 11k banks), Sony, etc.
The marketing value of power ledger is greater than chainlink, way easier to hype.
Not sure how that's true, but I guess it is.
the difference is POWR has a fucking viable team and not some autistic fat manchildren
Those autistic fat manchildren scored a PoC and demo for Swift you mong.The only outside crypto dev to receive this honor, no less.
>POWR Actually doing things, like installing power grids and making deals with energy companies>LINKOnly thing they are doing is loosing money.
No advancements and they're even loosing /biz shills LOL
So...buy LINK at it's ATL?sounds good to me
Actually doing thingsLol.Sony and AXA currently have a joint smart contract running with Chainlink.>No advancementsNot that you know of.They're working on the network, plain and simple.
all alts are crashing in 2 daysjust like the last flippening attemptit'll be a sea of redi'd wait this one out and buy it after it goes back down to 6k
