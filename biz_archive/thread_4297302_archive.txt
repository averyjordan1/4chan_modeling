BCH*more transactions*faster> 0.16$ Avarage transaction Fee (1.4$ fee if it reach the Bitcoin's Market cap)BTC>Slow as fuck (2 hour+ now)> 4$+ transaction fees only
Then why is it only Korean exchanges pumping BCC/BCH.Do you really think people will just jump ship and board some shady Bitcoin ripoff when Bitcoin has been here since 2009, get a grip man.
If that ever happens the whole crypto market will collapse and everyone loses.
you forgotBCH>just another altcoin
I wish I could be that girl so much.Instantly sign up to be an escort and fuck my way to my pension.Goddamn why cant I turn myself into a girl?!!
Then why is it only Korean exchanges pumping BCC/BCH.Because people are still under the blockstreams propaganda spell.Corecuckcoin is more shady than bitcoin cash, bitcoin cash is cotinuing the legacy of bitcoin, it is the real bitcoin.
BTC has been hijacked by corporate interests who are trying to centralize transactions via off-chain transactions.
lol good luck with that gonna have to wait at least a few years for bch since bitcoin is a normie invesment now so try and explain that to them.
blockstreams propaganda spell.I don't care about any of that, I'm just sitting in the same Bitcoin I was 7 years ago, not ever am I going to change to some Korean ripoff.
$1.4?
How did u calculate that?Minimum fee is 1 sat/byte.
Standard transaction is 255 bytes = min fee is 255 satoshi.Bitcoin would have to cost $549019 so that 255 satoshi is worth $1,4.
Do the math, son.
What do you get paid per post?
Get the fuck outta here.
Ahhhh, I get it.
You took average fee and multiplied it by BTC/BCH ratio.Well, let me enlighten you - people are overpaying (not their fault tho, probably their wallets).
It's not the same, it is cointinually developed and the team is taking it in a different direction, retard.
lol stay mad Korean boy
Shut up corecuck
you know bitcoin right?>we did a software update to make it faster and cheaper>its called bitcoin cashso hard to explain to normies OMG
stay made kike
Jones is an actual Jew lol
Replies with the overused analvore memeYou only want bch to flip btc so you make money, if bch didn't exist you could just get btc and not worry about shit like that.
Plenty of us who invest based on solid fundamentals and not "muh store of value" have held a large altcoin portfolio over bitcoin.
We understand when something is inflated in value for no fundamental reason and won't be left holding bags when the bubble pops.
So you admit BCH is in a bubble
That's not at all what Bitcoin cash is, and people can see through that lie
He's literally not you retard.
You're right, bitcoin cash is what bitcoin used to be, and bitcoin core is a kike centralization update applied to the old bitcoin.
