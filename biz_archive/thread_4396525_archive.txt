Because they're a blockchain based payment method>muh banksNot an argument
They have a token that trades on cryptocurrency exchanges?
Tfw when adult neet with 13yo mentality canâ€™t grasp the world for what it is.
Ripple will be #1 crypto.XRP is for enterpriseSupported by big businessSupported by govNot invested in XRP because of this?
Get rekt faggots.

Cos retards somehow believe Ripple is XRP.
They actually think anyone would use a volatile currency to trade millions.
Which is why you invest in stellar, essentially ripple but not a scam
i worked for a bank, im aware of our partnership with ripple labsthe problem is that XRP, the crypto related to ripple, is useless.
banks use private ripple platform called rc cloud which has NOTHING to do with xrp.
xrp is not secure at all for banking needs.
normies like you don't understand that tho
ancient fud, larping faggotdisproved time and time again
Because it is crypto.>doesn't rely on shitty proof of work>already has the coveted "lightning network" in place and to scale while buttards argue over 1 v 2 vs 8>people cry that most transactions go over ripplenet, which is exactly what bitcoin needs to do to scale
disprove it fat fuck
so it's not volatile then it is volatile make up your minds fudders
Is this true for Stellar as well?
I dind't buy in because I came to the same conclusion you did about Stellar and Ripple.
