fomoing so hard on LINK right now..
BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY
P-pump and dump??
I was going to buy back like 200k LINK.
My internet connection went out like two minutes after I heard the fork was canceled.
Now it's too late.
You do realise that LINK fudding, itself, is a meme right?You dont actually think that somethign with that much industry backing, shilling (by a 18.2 billion valued bank), headlining at the blockchain super conference, all the additional stuff, you surely didnt think it would fail....did you?Did you actually just get meme'd on the biggest crypto of 2018?
sigh ok so i only have around 120$ in btc, should i buy link or is it not even worth it with so little money?
Dumb fuck it's quite the opposite, LINK is the only coin thats worth it when you so little money.
Think about it: >Invest 100k in BTC>BTC goes to 14k 100k profit, not bad>Invest 120 USD in BTC>BTC goes to 14k120 USD profit, JUST.
USD in LINK>LINK goes 10x1200 USD, decent.
dumb fucksit's crashing againback to 0.17 if not lower
