Here is a project that has been severely overlooked.
I tried to accumulate in the past week but liquidity is so low its hard to get tokens.
This project is currently trading at 2/3 of ICO price and 1 week ago at 1/3 of ICO price.> The project aims to bring mobile internet for free towards people in exchange for ads.
So basically BAT for mobile phones in exchange for free internet.> Project has already signed major carriers all across the world> THey have a working app and product but they are going to rebrand in december.> 2 Major exchange listings in december (unconfirmed)> CEO is 30 under 30 for social entrepeneurs (whatever that means)> Revenue of 600k in Prior year, which is small but they are already generating revenue.> They have already signed over 300 carriers all across the world, so they are ready to go but now it depends on their marketing.Keep an eye out on this project as its close to live launch and is in my honest opinion still undervalued
bumping it once.
They already have a working product, it's incredible.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mgensuite.airfox.browser2
>Let's change all ICO Token terms, after everyone already put money in the project.>Let's allow some friends and insiders to refund for 2 hours, so everyone else gets fucked>Let's give everyone random discounts and don't lock them, because we just want money>Let's reopen the whitelist, because we want more money>And last but not least, ban everyone from telegram who is raising their voice.
