I was looking at other exchanged and found salt on gatecoin is about 5x more than bittrex, ive never used gatecoin and wondering if anyone has and if this works or if its just a buying price
Its real.
Go for high volume xchanges like rex if you can.
So ur saying i could move my salt over again and again and get like 100 grand today?
it's called arbitrage.
