WAIT IT WAS FUCKING DASH?
*breaths in*AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH FUCKING LMAO AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
it confirms what I've been thinking.There really aren't any more easy opportunities left.he's run out of new coins to shill so he goes for old ones like dash and ripple.dash was ez since it was already on a huge bull run.If he shilled something like chainlink, it'd spike up to 0.50 then drop again since there's no news, and his investors would be pissed.
I'm just glad POWR and SLR faggots got rekt
powr has a lot more to fall.
$600 million valuation for a solar coin?what a joke
