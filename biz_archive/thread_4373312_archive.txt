Anon, I...
Here's your pink Wojak
Just set my buy order for 4900.It will all make sense soon.
What...?
If it goes to 10k I recover my alt losses.
I need that money.
if it falls that low it means roger flippened it, so you wouldn't want to be holding any corecoin
and I'll set mine at 6250
4373521>he thinks its going to go below 7k ever again
I bought the dip at 5800 during the bcc shitstorm
>be sitting on btc>boring.jpg>fuck it ill scalp ETH for a few hours>BTC risesEVERY FUCKING TIMEVERYFUCKINGTIME
This happened to me with another alt.
this might sound stupid and i'm new here but if you buy ETH/ BTC for a certain amount of BTC, wouldnt you profit from holding ETH if ETH prices stay stable and BTC rises, since your amount of BTC stays the same ?
4373617Know that feeling, if I'm in on it, its sure to go down.
Fuck all shitcoin hope they all die.
I might be able to sleep again if they do
Fuck you.
Knew i should have done the same but the shit storm put me off, didn't know which way was up or down fuck
It's simple.
Can you get more if you sell it again?
If the answer is yes then there you have your profit..
I don't even trade BTC/USD anymore, no matter how much research or TA I do, 100% chance that I buy the top.
