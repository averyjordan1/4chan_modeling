A cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to sayAbout the things caught in my mindAs the day was dawning my plane flew awayWith all the things caught in my mindAnd I want to be there when you'reComing downAnd I want to be there when you hit the groundSo don't go away, say what you sayBut say that you'll stayForever and a day in the time of my life'Cause I need more time, yes, I need more timeJust to make things right
