So I guess BCC won't be dropping below 0.1....that's a lot of BTC right there....
that wall was there at 0.2 but it disappeared when right near so I wouldn't count on it.
How is a wall at .1 going to help?
We needed that wall at 0.3 not fucking 0.1 fuck that gay shit.Fuck bch.
It's going to disappear obviously
Whales trolling and laughing
