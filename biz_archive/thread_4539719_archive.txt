Daily reminder this fluffy CAT will hit 5$ in December.
That cat looks rather unfluffy to me
Do not look at the outside alone.
It is aa very friendly and nice one.
Just dumped this shitcoin yesterday.
I've lost so much on it.

I've held this shitcoin since it first launched.
I don't even care anymore.
Glad to nit have any anymore!

I hope this coin dies in a fucking fire!
