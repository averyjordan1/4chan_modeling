The Movement DAO will be big.
There are many legendary bitcointalk users working on the project.
Check the Google docs airdrop list if you don't believe me.Current market cap is only $80,000.
This is because it was an airdrop.
This is decentralization the way it was meant to be done.
Why is it important that legendary users are working on the project?
Because these guys are all likely millionaires or great devs.Just wanted to give you guys the heads up.
