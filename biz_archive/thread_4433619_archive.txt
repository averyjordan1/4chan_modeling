>$32 million person team.
Literally, just 2 people.Youre joking right.
antshares guys are doing uber after work
yeah, I don't get it
I could name fucking 100s successful startups that started as 1 or 2 people, pretty much every big company today started as 1 or 2 people, this is a really shit point you're making.Regardless how many people involved doesn't matter sergey worked on this for 4 years and they already have a working product before they even held an ICO.
He has already proved himself capable, capable enough to SWIFT which trades trillions daily and several other banks, some fucking neet shitposting on 4chans opinion doesn't matter.
They hired a third, but Sergey ate him

2 people never made a successful company everdrrrrrrrreerrrrrr
See you on Mars.
