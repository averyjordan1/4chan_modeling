This info on SolarPower Europe website may hint about the partnership of Solarcoin and Tesla.
It may not be fake!http://solarpowereurope.org/index.php?id=963&ADMCMD_cooluri=1
Just download their case study
Some people say fake but I think it is quiet for a reason...something big to be announced.
I'm going to verify these now from my Aunt in cali that works at Tesla.
Not op, but waiting for auntie to verify or not.
It says they performed case studies on those things...
If I tell you I'm going to do case studies on Walmart and McDonalds are you going to assume a merger is in the works?
OP said partnership not merger.
Partnership could be any type of business relationship.
solarcoin>not power ledgerkek, you fags have got it all wrong
forgive me... "It says they performed case studies on those things...
If I tell you I'm going to do case studies on Walmart and Mcdonalds are you going to assume a PARTNERSHIP is in the works?"
Yes, but when they start talking about the "Smart Building Package" that is what you can think of...
there ARE quite a few Mcdonalds inside of wally worlds
still waiting on message right now.
Solarcoin has the potential to become a legitimate currency since it incentivizes energy production through solar panels.
It will have an intrinsic value - more so than "muh ledger"Also, their QT wallet is top of the line
Not me.
I am still waiting too.

the connection between tesla and a solar related company is Power Ledger (POWR)
