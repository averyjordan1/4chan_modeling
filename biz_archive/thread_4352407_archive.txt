krakenit's about 2 min behindit's great for ppl like me though who abuse waves b/c people can't be nimble

Holding bchJesus Christ I don't think there is help for your kind
Don’t know don’t care, gained 49% off that shit, I get off my phone for ten minutes and then I was suddenly down 20.
I’m fucking done listening to the shilling on this website.
Trying to recooperate my losses.
The interest you are talking was pumping fake volume.
Rest of it was people hoping to get rich quick.
Pumping is over, dump has happened so no other than pajeets interest left.
Decide yourself
nice opinion but what about when bch hits .25 tonight?
Just hold.
BTC already lost 30% of the hash rate and climbing.
Expect BTC to plummet over the next couple weeks as the network grinds to a halt while they desperately wait for their difficulty adjustment, by which time Operation Dragonslayer will be complete.
November 25th is the day BTC dies.
Screencap this.
BCH is for fucking faggots!
It's for n00bn00bs.
it's for retards who don't know whats going on.
Anyone who's been here for a while (years) knows that BCH is an attack on bitcoin.
it will fail.
and bitcoin will move on.
LOL.
you don't think core has a plan B and a C which have their own plan Bs and Cs?
BTC mempool is filling up again, another panic could end really badly.
Previous trading highs BTC mempool has at least emptied, but with less hashpower than the previous occilations it isn't happening as easily.Plus, the transaction fees required to send tx during these panics is getting higher and higher each time.
How long are people going to hodl BTC when they worry about being able to get it out during a panic?
