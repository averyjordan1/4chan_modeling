Can anyone please explain to me why LTC hasn't been making any substantial gains
>Gained 15 bucks with a few month period.>It isn't collapsing like every other Alt.>This is a bad thing.
fiat Jesus Christ.
I swear ltc is traded in a way to deliberately leech btc from newfags
It's going at a lite pace
shitcoin
Bitcoin Cash is Litecoin and Bitcoin in one.
ThatÂ´s probably why
it has a terrible name, why would anyone want to invest in a lite version of somethingdo you salivate at the thought of ordering things from the lite menu
Because Litecoin is a shitcoin.
It delivers nothing, it's only value is derived from BTC shills advocating its use because they don't want newfags to use Bitcoin Cash.Litecoin also offers nothing in terms of innovation, it is quite literally a testnet for Bitcoin Core.Pic related.As Bitcoin Cash's market value rises, LTC will be one of the first shitcoins to start to die off.
