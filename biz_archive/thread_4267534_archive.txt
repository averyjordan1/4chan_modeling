REQed again retards.Thanks for buying my bags, so glad im out of this shit.
it just never stopsi kind of felt bad for choosing REQ instead of ARK, but they're both at 50%still down half my ATH
req, link time started, you regret selling them
LOL this is REQ's ATH.
It's a bit over ico.
Good price to buy in.
You're in early OP.
You are gonna make it!!!!!!!!
thanks for ur bag fag.
it's literally at ATHfucking retardwojacks soon
You so dumb OP.
lol nice FUD attempt pajeet
I'm really bad at this.I'd buy at ATHs sell for less because I'd think "moons coming!!!"
Happened with Verge and Digibyte.
Admittedly, I cashed out quit on both because I couldn't handle watching the ticker.So the next time I went in on a scam coin, I bought, and immediately listed the ask for a healthy number.Woke up this morning and voila!
I made money.But my XVG is still burning a hole in my pocket.
XVG is a fork of DOGECOIN and was called DOGECOINDARK before rebranding.Why would ANYONE buy such a pile of shit?
