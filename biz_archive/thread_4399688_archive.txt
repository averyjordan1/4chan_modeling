How can I learn as much as possible as quickly as possible?
you better forget about mining bitcoin
these stairs are fucking beautifulhow much money do I need to get this house ?I already have the girl
Bitcoin/ Altcoin all things are to be considered
I'm saying this as former bitcoin miner: just buy bitcoins, store them good and hold for long time.
You don't pick better coin to mine
Only the stairs I calculate that it's worth a 1,600 us dollars, the rest of the house depend how big or luxury you want ^^
Why is that?
I know its not that profitable, but if you were to mine BTC, would you still not make a profit?
(As measly as it could be)
That's the most retarded design The amount times you'll be tripping and falling as your climbing up because your foot gets stuck in the gaps unless you tip toe slowly
I want this fucking house.
Thank you for the motivation pic
Not unless you buy ASIC.
