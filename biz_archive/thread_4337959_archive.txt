Whats your predictions to XMR after this shitstorm?
Exit Scam in 2023
$250 before the weekend
$500 end of 2018.
$2000 end of 2020.Remember, billions and billions of dollars are made in the criminal sphere.
By 2020 criminals and money launderers will find their way to Monero, and its price will explode.
wait wat?
Whats your predictions to XMR after this shitstorm?Same as they've always been.Monero will keep growing until probably late 2018 when the crypto bubble will pop and everything gets dragged down to near bottom.
After that it's anyone's fucking guess.
As long as the developers don't sudoku I think Monero will emerge as one of the top 3 cryptos (if there are even 3 left) and the price will again rise accordingly to it's adoption by drug dealers.
Yes sir.
Buy monero ,the coin!
$200 by end of month at least.
