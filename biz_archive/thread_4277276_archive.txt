I had some leftover bitcoin in my account so I bought a whole 37 LINK coins.
How rich am I going to be?
I can officially meme now.
Is 3700 at EOY enough for you?
That in itself has made you rich.
Not in any monetary sense, but a richness in spirit
the 14 year olds on this board trading my daily grocery bill always bring a kek
Never selling ever until it hardcore moons.
Like BTC moons.
Mfw even if LINK becomes the same price as BTC I will only have 420,000,000>Not even 1 billionShould I just end it anons?
