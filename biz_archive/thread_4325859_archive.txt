HERE WE GO BOIS.
PUUUSSSHHH
Why is it pumping ?
Is it the official coin of gay homos?
Have you not seen their slip up from last night?
The website was down for a while after.It means they are partnered with LINK
Nothings wrong with being gay, faggot
CAN SHE LIFT IT?
I am not following news from LINKI just invested in it tho and wondering why we are pumping
Could something have been announced in Slack?
whats habbening bro?
Some swift-chainlink shit got leaked
Partnership with wells fargo announced.
They will be implementing a chainlink system into every ATM to confirm deposits and withdrawals.
Post a link faggot is this true is it happaning!?!?!
Yeah 4chan was all over it last night.
Now reddit are too.
GO check out the sub reddithttps://www.reddit.com/r/LINKTrader/comments/7cg9hr/someone_was_asking_for_a_screenshot_of_this_i/
*brap*
WHAT THE FUCK.
The absolute state of reddit.
We were talking about that hours ago and they're only drooling about it now?
No they were talking about it 4 hours ago.
Some people have lives outside of crypto and are holding LINK long term so arent in a particular rush for anything.
Like myself
Just got $100 more eth in coin base and now won't send to etherdelta.
I have $900 in btc locked up on its way to eth from two days ago I only have 2800 LINK will I make it?
TBj its falling back down.
SWIFT wont be announcing till Q2.
ANd people will hold for a while, but asking for 6 months hold is a mosntrous oppurtunity cost (see BCH, confido,etc.
)Just DCA your way in.
This is my chain link there are others like it but this one is mine
There is no link to follow anymore, they slipped up land evidence of testing transactions between Swift was leaked.
Took it down soon after it was found.
Why do you guys care so much about this JSON parser?
AAAAAND DOWN WE GO

deadass serious, no shills
.01$ by christmas screencap this
any reasonable and logical reason why
automated bond paymentswow, ive been getting these since 2003
it might get another pump up to .25, thats its max valuelong term probably below .1, like .05.there are too many other oracles.
there are like 6 oracle ICOs this month all raising as much or money money than link and offering the same product.for example https://mobius.network/its just a json parser so its too easy to recreate and copy
