Nocoiners get out.
There is no flippening.
Check out pic related.
ITS HAPPENING, but its not the flippening.
CRYPTO IS GOING TO DESTROY FIAT.
BTG IS WHAT, $800?
BCC over $1000?What we should be doing is figuring out the next one to crack $1k.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON BCC RIGHT NOW, ITS PUMPED TO HELLI say its BTG, then eth, then dash.
ALL WILL GO OVER 1k, MANY MORE WILL GO OVER 1k BY SUMMER 2018.Stop being such whiners, BTC will be 10k by feb. SCREENCAP THIS
BTX
BTX, hmmm this looks pretty good id say
BTW im not trying to fud BCC, I just think it will dip back under $1k tonight or tomorrow and give folks a second chance to get in
just broke 2k core cuck SEE YOU FUCKERS AT 3K
BYEEEEEEEEEEE THE FLIPPENING IS HEREEEEEE
checked......I will buy in at $800
BTG will prolly beat BTX to 1k tho, wallet isn't even out yet
The real flippening will occur when BTG goes live.
MFW I find out people are still shilling for the fucking stillborn BTG project created for the sole purpose of a pre-mine scam
I think BTC will always be top dog, but there is room for other cool cats above 1k, I think it will be:BTG------>ETH-------->DASH-------->LTC
why is it $800 anon, why?
