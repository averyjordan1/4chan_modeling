Guess what?
This badass motherfucker BitMEX CEO ARTHUR HAYES is dumping every customer's Bcash and crediting them with BTC on the exchange.
Not only that, but they've just opened Bcash futures with 20x leverage so everyone can short that shit to the grave.https://blog.bitmex.com/bitcoin-cash-futures-now-live/So why aren't you trading on BitMEX, /biz/?
Too cuck to handle 100x leverage?
Keep chasing shitcoin pumps on your chintzy-ass bucket shops.
Eli5?
ROGER VER BTFO
Wait wait wait wait.. so youre saying he's selling his Bitcoin, for their Bitcoin Cash?
HMM.
dumping every customer's Bcash and crediting them with BTC on the exchangesource?>inb4 this nigger is "buying" it himself for the flippening
Trusting your coins in the hands of a nigger
When the Bcash fork happened, everyone with BTC was credited an equal amount of Bcash.Unless they had their coins on an exchange, in which case they were subject to the whims of the exchange.
Bittrex credited users, Coinbase/GDAX is still holding them but release them next year iirc, and BitMEX decided not to support the fork and told customers in advance to withdraw their coins if they wanted their Bcash.Since then they've held all the Bcash for those who didn't withdraw, and now they're selling all of it and crediting users with BTC on the exchange.sourceThe link is in the OP, dumbass.
"Users will not receive Bitcoin Cash, rather BitMEX will sell all users’ Bitcoin Cash, and credit their wallet with the Bitcoin proceeds."
>Users will not receive Bitcoin Cash, rather BitMEX will sell all users’ Bitcoin Cash, and credit their wallet with the Bitcoin proceeds.lol holy shit, he doesnt even say what price they are getting.
he's probably making people pay .5 btc for their BCH he is stealing, top kek
bitmex is going to dump a fuck load of bch.he posted a source!
!my god are you people all retarded?
do you not understand what's going on?
this is fucking huge.bitmex holds /millions of dollars/ worth of bitcoin.
they are going to dump an equivalent amount of bch.bitcoin cash is going to crash HARD.
there is not nearly enough buy support on this shit coin to absorb this.
this is a sell goys even if he doesn't actually do it
Great.
BitMEX have been corecucks forever.
Them wasting their ammo now pushing the difficulty of BCH even lower will amplify the pain when the push happens in the other direction and the difficulty jumps to whatever profitability is necessary to counteract this.It's funny, really.
They don't seem to understand they're mounting a speculative attack on the exact economic actors they've been handing money hand over fist to for years now, and who are absolutely happy to have them hand over the rest of it too.Bring it corecucks.
Gee I wonder
