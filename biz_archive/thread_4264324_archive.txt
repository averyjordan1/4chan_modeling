the smart people got out of this vaporwarewas a good ride, but it's going nowherewait for the next flavor of the month
I started in crypto 2 months ago with $300 into WTC at under $1, and I thought I would never see gains that high again.
There's no way I would've thought I'd be able to trade my way up to owning more than 1.5 bitcoin in under 2 months.
Thank you so fucking much to whoever posted about Confido on here over a month ago.
