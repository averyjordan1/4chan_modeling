Trying to dump some LINK bags but I can't even do that without the bots trying to push my sell orders lowerGoing to post 3 screenshots - watch the bot follow my sell orders.Im trying to sell 10kand the bot places a sell order of 13k 1 satoshi cheaper than the lowest sell order over 5k (from what ive tested)Im really done with this shit guys
Just wait you fucking retard.
How impatient are you
I shouldve noted that the first screenshot is as soon as i placed the order, so the 13k is blocking somebody elses sell, and about to move to mine
Just wait you fucking retard.
How impatient are youWhat can you expect from someone who is just about to dump his LINK bags kek.
Fucker has ADHD.
People can run bots on their computers to do what you said.
Binance doesn't give a shit about your shitcoin.
>hes selling his chainlink>he let the fud get to him, eventhough the fundamentals are as clear as daylightIf anything, you should be thanking the bots for making sure you dont do something drastic

Maybe he doesn't want to wait 6 months.
Yes maybe then the market will be up 200 Billion, BTC at 20k and link might be 25 cents or some shit.
Super worth it to hold long term.
Binance isn't a shithole just because of the bots.
It's a shithole because they don't allow conditional orders but they have no problems with bots.
Yes maybe then the market will be up 200 Billion, BTC at 20k and link might be 25 cents or some shitOr LINK could be at $1 and BTC at 20k.
See where im going with this?
Exactly man, I don't know why people feel like they have to make a trade a day when if they wait it's guaranteed gains in some of these currencies.
Don't know if you're serious or not, but i was sarcastic as fuck in that.
It makes perfect sense why people are selling LINK for other coins.They are not giving any updates and this token is just gonna go lower and lower and lower.
Guaranteed gains are in BTC
