FUCK OFF CHUCK NORRIS
im a holder, i just want to manage expectations
Yeah, it's not Binance b/c Binance wanted a prototype which isn't ready yet.
Lol.
There goes the hope.
RPX did well on Kucoin so maybe CFD will too if it gets listed there.
FUCK YOU'RE IDIOTS, the dev just assumed that
There's nothing to assume.
Binance has requirements that Confido is unable to meet right now, according to Confido's CEO.But, yes, there's gonna be exchange news soon.
