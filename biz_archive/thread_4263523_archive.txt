You fell for ODNYou fell for LINKYou fell for ELIXYou fell for REQYou fell for AirswapYou fell for FLIKYou fell for CFDYou fell for NULSHonestly when will you learn?
fell for CFDFell for CFD?
You mean I have nearly 20x my 2 eth?
I fell for it.
At this point should I sell or will it eventually creep back up?
The whitepaper doesn't make me very confident
I'm not talking about ICO investors, I'm talking about the cucks who bought in yesterday at $0.80 a token expecting 5x gains by the end of the week
If "falling" for NULS means quadrupaling my portfolio, then I hope I keep falling.
Some fag posted a pump and dump grp.
I'm in it and I get emails like "Keep your 4chan and reddit posts ready".
When you see a coin getting shilled everywhere it most likely this or some other grp trying to talk you into buying shitbags.
There's no way shitposting on biz is going to significantly pump it
Well that isn't falling for CFD is it.
That's called buying high.
Retard.
lol, up 40% on LINK since buying at 17c.Up 70% on REQ and still going.
up 300% on CFD.Fuck off back to your shitting street pajeet.
I know but they think it will help
dunno what you're talking about, I made profit on like half of thoseELIX was probably the best for me, turned 9 ETH into around 70 ETH
Not every idiot is buying into 3x ATH pumps.
But as usually, your lack of judgement is everybody else's fault.
4263671OP is obviously a pajeet that bought at ATH hoping for a quick 30% gain and lost all his money.
Now, of course, he blames everyone else for his stupid choices.
Nice.
Yup.
You can still make sweet gains on pumped shitcoins but only if you have the common fucking sense to check how much it's already been shilled and how much it's already pumped.
Fucking morons here always FOMOing in at the last minute before it dumps.
Wow, it did 20x .
What was max investment?
>>Fell for REQBut I bought it at 400 and now it's almost 900....?
Thanks biz sell low buy high never change!
