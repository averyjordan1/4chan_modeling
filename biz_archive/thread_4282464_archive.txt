Just bought $14 worth of euro at 50x leverage, maybe i'll let you visit my mansion later this year.
are real currencies worht investing?
i remember several euro states shorting swiss franken a few years ago and then getting justed really hard when the franken rose in price.
They're fun to trade with, but i'd never invest in government good boy points.
