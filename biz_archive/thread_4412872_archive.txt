I'm American but my girl lives in Sunshine Coast, we met online a year ago (long story).
I'm going to go see her for the first time in a few months, is there anything you recommend doing in the area?
Because I've been away from my home country for almost a year, and I've gotten what I wanted out of my journey.I have about $800 to my name, which isn't even enough to get me a flight home.Brisbane is nice and all, but I'd rather get on with my life.Not really.
Alcohol is expensive, bars close early, and local sights are all tourist traps.
sunny coast- good sights around the area, lots of nice beaches etc.
fraser island, noosa etc.
you'll love it.
good time to come during summer
what qualifications do you have?I think you can maybe rack up a fair amount of seasonal work with the farms/abbatoirs?
None, except previous part time work.Currently working in a bar where I barely make rent and food money.
Bought a pair of steel cap shoes, and I'm gonna get a white card next paycheck and hit up construction sites in the neighbourhood and ask for work.
Traveling to the other side of the planet for some pussy
