Is $7100-7200 for BTC the new dip?
I feel like I'm just gonna miss out on the next moon if I sit around and wait for a $6400-6500 order to fill.

Needs to hit its moving average soon which is 5k.
Buy then
why is 7500 going to be a break out?it's not a key resistance.
not a psych resistance either cause we already broke it once.
During BCASH incident, it only went to 5.5k and recovered.
Why do you do think it would go as low as 5k any time soon?
