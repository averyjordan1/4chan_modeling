Get out or short the shit of it.
It doesn't even have a working testnet.
fud it comes out in 2 weeks
Single threaded testnet - it's a shitty eth at this point.
You say EOS is like Ether?
Yes.
Sell now, buy the massive dip.
what entry point do you recommend?
I don't see why EOS pumped.
Not even half of the coins are released and no working final product was presented.
Single threaded testnet isn't something special.
So no tech that backs up the price up until now.
Anything below prepump (0.5$) seems reasonable and actually reflects the price that EOS is really worth.
