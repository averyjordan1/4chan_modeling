I've been bagholding this since August.
Is it time to realize the losses, or keep holding?Currently, im in at an average price of $3.96 for 1/5 of my total portfolio and it sits around $1.60
drop that shit like a nigger baby.
Tough one, I'm holding some as well.Major announcement about dividends could shoot it up to the moon.
But it's entirely unclear when that's gonna happen.
On the other hand, other card projects won't do it much better as they recently solved the majority of their scaling issues.I'd do some dollar cost averaging if you have the patience to wait until the end of the year or maybe even longer...
It's a long term hold.
I have nothing but patience with this coin, I have too much tied up in it to drop.
I sold my bags long ago, this shitcoin is going nowhere but down
Keep on doing your cost averaging, I'm doing the same.
I'm sure it's going to be 100% worth it.
The team is all in it for the long term, staying low marketing wise.
They recently got a new card supplier and are working things out regarding transaction fees rewards per token.
If the amount of cards and transaction volume grows, the rewards (and thus, value of the token) could be huge.
Why do you idiots throw this word around?
If you keep throwing it around it becomes meaningless.TenX has a working product and active development.
The tokens are however not worth THAT much because it's still in the early days.
What has been a major problem is not to do with TenX, but the markets, which has not been kind to it.
You can expect it to moon next when cards are issued for the US.
