There are two rumors about POWR(Power Ledger on Binance).
First rumor is it will be listed on Bittrex in the near future.
Second rumor is Palm Beach Confidential will recommend POWR in the next issue of their newsletter.
POWR also is holding an AMA(ask me anything) session on November 14th to discuss potential partnerships, platform releases and etc.
I really feel like Utsunomiya Shiin is too beautiful to do JAV, I'm not even a white knight or anything and I'm happy about it but damn.
Seeing her lick hairy assholes and drink gallons of cum just doesn't feel right.
Ah fuck I thought their AMA was today, looks like another day of waiting.
Hopefully they emphasise on strong partnerships and bright plans for next year.Although she's pretty vanilla she's fucking great, that body is top notch.
Many such cases.
I don't understand why some JAV stars are absolutely beautiful.
I mean can't they just marry a banker or something?
Why do they do porn?
explain powr to me, because as far as i can see it is absolute garbage.
maybe it gets a pump, but theres no point to risk hodling bags that will literally never deliver
Get your jet packs ready.
It's gonna moon once Teeka the shill master reveals it.
I clicked on this thread for the girl then I stayed for the coin;) nice work oP
