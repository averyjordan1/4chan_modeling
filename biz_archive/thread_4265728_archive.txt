Poorfag brainlet here have around 4k link Bought in @ .28c.
Should I sell it now and rebuy later when it drops again or were there some big news which I am not aware of?Thx linkbros
you cant short link on any exchanges from what im aware of
selling and buying back later is shortingwhat you're thinking of is shorting on margin
I did the same thing 10xLink always drops back to 0.17~
are you retarded?
Multiplier 1.Guess who's the retard.
prove me wrong.protip: u can't
"shorting" by definition is selling something you do not own (borrowed).
no, it's by definition the opposite of longing.
both of which can be done either on margin or not.
oh dear, you arent the guy from  are you?
So basically what you're asking is if you should execute /biz-strategy#1: "buy high sell low"?Very much recommended.
By shorting I meant selling it now and buy it when it drops again didn't know this wasn't called shorting.
it is.
these people are just brainlets
I am not retarded I just asked if you people think link will fall again so I can accumulate more
I can't handle this board anymore.
Link will never see 17 cents again.
