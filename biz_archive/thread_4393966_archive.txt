You guys keep posting your crypto portfolios.
But the question is how to you adjust the weights.
Is it random or do you set them according to how you feel about specific coin, or do you make them market weighted?
Maybe someone uses Markowitz portfolio theory in order to lessen the correlation between your crypto assets?
Or maybe you use any other advanced method?

I try to listen to Teekaequal pos sizing is good because you'll never overbuy losers and never underbuy winnersbut really I don't and just go 1/3 on 3 or 50:50 on two alts
interested as well.
but I have a feeling that many base their % on the amount of shilling on biz.
I tried not to rebalance very much so as not too increase my tax headaches for the day I have to deal with very much.
I did wind adjusting some of it though.If I feel the need to adjust it will be based on my feelings about the stability of the coin, it's not very scientific.
But I'm not a very refined /biz/poster.
