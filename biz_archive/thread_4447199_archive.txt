Coss holder here.
Am I the only one that thinks the "refreshed" UI looks absolutely... shitty?
It looks like a 1st grade graphics design student made it in his spare time.
dude, how long do you plan to accumulate
no COSS fud please.
i am the other holder here who tries to warn /biz/ about this upcoming moon mission.
these are minor flaws which can easily be fixed anyway
I stopped accumulating, last time I bought was at 1030sat.
I have around 0.5 BTC in coss and I still think about it as high risk high reward project.
i got 5btc in now.
comfy
