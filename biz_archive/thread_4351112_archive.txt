Would appreciate getting some things cleared up.
I've been trading on and off for the past month or two but haven't been very invested.
I noticed today that Bitcoin Cash has a volume of 66924.887 on bittrex.
Am I mistaken or is that absolutely ridiculously high?
I don't think I've I have even seen a volume over 10k on bittrex.
Is there a reason for this?
Also, I've noticed that people are now referring to Bitcoin Cash as "BCH" instead of BCC.
Why?
