Do you guys take any extra security for your Binance/Etherdelta etc account, Or is it really only your private wallet and its keys you're careful of?2.
My understanding is you have a basic wallet on the exchange site and you send your shitcoins to and from it from your secure private wallet which is your proper store.
If that's right, is it a rapid process or does it take time or cost fees?
Just send small amounts if you don't trust it yet.
Was more nervous of the account getting hacked rather than me fucking up the trades.
I literally set up an offline USB OS to generate my wallet, but for Binance I'm just gonna trade on my home PC or phone with a good password?
Or is everyone using second PCs with no other shit on and I'd be a tard to not do that too.
