NOOO MY LINKIES AAAAAAAHHHH
comfy since $2
cant wait for these fuckers to put out an actual product, the moon is going to be glorious
lets get'em lady bois.
Links and Omise are back on the launchpad, better get ready.
Conservative prediction for when the tokens are actually in use is $300.
And that's pure calculated on profits from staking and money currently flowing through omise network.
Not taking into account the fomo that may drive it higher and all the other partners/customers omise will have by then
holding only Link; OMG and XMR, my body is ready
 will be a good year for you
i'm thinking 2018 will be too
These fucks are going to fuck you over.
They have no scruples.
That's already been established.
Last call before lift off, ramps are down.
OMG is the altcoin with the greatest potential to reach triple digits.
There is a real incentive to hold these coins after staking is complete which puts it far ahead other coins that are only bought because of hope for a higher price to sell later.
Guys...
Either it's whale games or he knows some insider info
