Wtf were you think dude.
wowitsfuckingnothing.bmp"how does it feel to know that you may have to wait a few weeks before your pathetically small investment is in the green?"
I wasn't
might be small to you Mr. Moneybagz
You have no choice but to hodlI do not envy that experience though
I'm actually totally kidding about the vacation part hahaha I sold it all at the last minute for a small profit because I felt uneasy.
I just wanted everyone to call me a faggot but no one wanted to ridicule me.
tfw buying in at $7200
In 5 years any buy under 10k will be great.
As long as you didn't need that money right now you're fine.
What was the best and worst things you did while on vacation?
yup!
i always tell myself when i buy ath"it's never a bad time to buy bitcoin"
faggot
This.
It's only a matter of time before the previous ATH doubles again
