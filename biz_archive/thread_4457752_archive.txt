lol i've been in neo (antshares) since it was 2$.
and everyone always brings this up.
It isn't true at all, please stop believing fud you see on 4chan.
We all know u prob sold neo at a loss and don't want it to go back up.
I sold NEO at a $15 gain per coin, 470 and left 200 in until after all this PnD shit clears up.
I moved it all into BQX and have gotten a nice 10% gain in the mean time.
2000 Gas sell Wall just removes on Binance, time to moon
