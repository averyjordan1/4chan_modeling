For a second I literally thought you meant "sharted" and that your shit was levitating.
I shouldn't be alive
Good practice as taught by /biz/
Made me kek thx anon
Here's something interesting.
BCH/BTC and BTC/USD are inversely correlated right now but if you look closely when BCH/BTC sells off BTC/USD rallies are small and when BCH/BTC moves up BTC/USD selling is more pronounced.
That looks as if some BTC are being sold into USD and not coming back.
Sometimes I think people just make up these threads so they can post their custom pink wojaks
>thinking anything could kill bitcoin over night
Yes, a lot of the unconfirmed tx people are exiting to fiat as soon as they possibly can.BCH wins not by absorbing BTC, but rather by destroying confidence in BTC.
Sure man sure.
FUCK WENT UP AGAIN
Yep, that's what I'm doing, I don't want to be holding btc right now.
Lol, same.
Did I actually do a good trade for once /biz/?
destroying confidence in BTC.in all cryptocurrencies, you meanotherwise they'd be moving to BCH
WHY THE FUCK ARE PEOPLE BUYING THATS FUCKING RETARDED IF THEY WANTED TO BUY SO MUCH WHY DIDNT THEY BUY WHEN IT WAS DIPPING 2 HOURS AGO??
FUCKING HYPOCRITES I HOPE THEY ALL LOSE THEIR MONEY
Yes, unfortunately.
Normies strangely don't want to pay $20 and wait a day to move their ponzi coins around.
And since the Segwitcoin people have been censoring all discussion of alt coins, they don't know that this problem is unique to Segwitcoin.They will come back eventually.
SAME AHAHHAHAHAHA WTFFFFFD
