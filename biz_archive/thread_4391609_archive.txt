I will only be posting this once today so don't miss this:We are the fastest growing pump group, Super Bittrex Pump.
https://discord.gg/Kx3CR9ZThe owner of this group has 3 different pump groups, all with 3000-4000 members.
This will be the next one.No rush to get in here, we won't be doing our first pump until we reach at least 4,000 members (which we expect to hit in a couple of days.)
You might as well get in here soon, however, because by inviting people, you work up the ranks and get notified sooner for pumps (more profit.)
>But Anon, the higher ranks just dump on the lower ranks!
That happens to all of the idiots who don't invite people.
If you spend 15 minutes inviting people to gain 3-4 ranks you are guaranteed 10-30% profit per pump.
Also, we pump coins at breakout points so there is a better chance for others to FOMO in so that everyone profits.>But Anon, I lost money in Pumps & Dumps!See above.
Also, If you're scared, just "pretend buy" during our first pump and see how much money you would have made.
Like I said, there's no rush.
But we might take off to the moon without you, and you might regret not pumping with us sooner.
you work up the ranks and get notified sooner for pumpsso THATS why there's so much fucking pump group shilling the last while, shilling means they get dumped on not as hard.gotcha.
well, anyways, fuck you
isnt it easier going to tradingview.com and seeing which coins are on the verge of a breakout and use investing.com - can get signals there.Rather than a smelly pajeet discord.fuck off.
it is easier with P&Ds.
But P&D's only happen once per week you see
Awesome man just as expected will earn a lot
