Was anyone else waiting for Ethereum to dip and is now getting JUST'd
Nah.
I've been holding ETH since January.Find your ETH now and hold for a year you impatient fuck.
Of course not.You wait for it to dip when it's overbought.It's been months that ETH is stagnating at the same fiat price and is falling in respect to BTC
lol it's been floating at 300 usd for a while now it was bound to make a move soon , what dip where you waiting for
Sold at 327, waited for another dip to 305.
Looks like 330 is the next possible dip here.
idiot when eth broke $330 that was the bull signal
Why is everyone acting like ETH is having some major pump?
Its still below .05, wake me up when it at least gets back close to .1.
yeah waiting for sub 300$ still
