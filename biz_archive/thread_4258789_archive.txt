Blockfolio thread Should I sell my eth
Not really a blockfolio worth showing if you barely have anything besides BTC, but kudos to you.
Sell now while it's still low.
Eth has no reason to moon now that the fork is over.
Get rid of that BTC and put it all on link
do the exact opposite of this.
If I have my bitcoin gold on a personal wallet not on an exchange there is no way to transfer and sell it now right?
Sell your btc.
Correction is imminent.
Stay in fiat until a clear breakout on the ETHUSD pair.
I'd say 330usd is the breakout threshold.Or you could gamble in a few solid alt that are in the low now.
REQ, ZRX, ODN
sell your ETH, yes.
Everything else is fine.
May want to pick up some more alts
Hamu.
Buy a bit more Litecoin.
miners only keep eth
This is my first time getting alts.Do you guys usually let a certain amount sit in btc?Also do you put stop sell orders on all your alts?
No we go all in to some shitcoin which biz shills and then we sell it at loss and move on to next one.
Gonna put more in soon.
What else should I get?
NULS
feels so good to be balls deep on projects with actual value.
I don't even need to watch my portfolio anymore
Needs more HIGH RISK altcoins.
it seems like it'll crash soonShould I still buy at $.85?
absolute madmanwould you care to explain how do you started?
and nuls isn't even on blockfolio
How dumb am I?
Biz bros, what altcoins should I invest in?
I just bought some FTC today and am looking to expand my portfolio.
Do Not sell ETHEREUMDo Not SellLitecoin>Etheruem to hit $100,000 by 2035>Litecoin to hit $1,000 by 2020We are the future 1% just invest and be patient
Sell your ETH and BTC for ARK.
How do you even get started with all this?
I've been wanting to get into it.
I think I should sell my bitcoin for Neo.
Will be putting in more money for Ark and Ethereum soon.
bags hangin' in there
