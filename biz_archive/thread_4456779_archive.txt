not sure what it is worth, but it is not a rumor or a soon to be news, tenx is actually listed on the visa website:https://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do?companyNameCriteria=tenx

someone did some math on tenx dividend structure and calculated that the price wont ever be worth more than $4good luck on that moon mission
17th of November it's dated.
Not a big deal:>Julian , in a recent Q&A , says they’re “basically”a Visa Program Manager but they don’t make a big deal of it.Now you can look up TenX in the Visa registry AND Monaco (their parent or sister company or whatever is Foris).
They have the exact SAME listing in the registry.What does this mean?
No damn clue.A Visa Program Manager basically controls their own program/fees and handles their own customer service.
I think it’s a great thing to have and it looks like TenX has it too
