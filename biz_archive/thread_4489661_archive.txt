Is there any coin you can mine for providing bandwith?
RDD
not quite what I'm looking for, I have a server with a 10gbit connection with no bandwith limitation here which I would like to use to get some profits out of it.Something like Storj, but you get coins for transferring the files and not for storing them.
WIFIC
I mean WiC, not WIFIC
Also, who's the slut?
Sauce?
