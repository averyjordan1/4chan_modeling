I'm getting out of BTC and going into BCH instead.
It's clear that the flippening is actually happening now.
I'm SICK of losing to BCH.
All hail the new king!
bend the knee!
SELL LOW BUY HIGH
Why though?
Bitcoin seems to be rising again, while BCH is ranging as fuck, despite what shills tell you.Also good luck selling BCH.
You realize you need a buyer, right?
Are you new to crypto?
You know that people don't buy falling coins?
You know that people don't buy falling coins?Lol not everyone is a compulsive ATH buyer like yourself.
Smart people buy when it drops.
Not when it's BCH which has no support except some dudes from /biz/ and obvious shills on reddit.
It's actually baffling that this is going on.
BTC > BCH because normies want the classic one
I'm all in too bro.
China is going to make us fucking rich
rising>fallingSlow coiner.
Bitcoin has no scaling future in sight.
It's completely noncompetitive with other ordinary fiat transfer options.Since the 2x fork failed, there's no hope for the community to realistically scale.
Bitcoin Cash represents the realistic alternative.
has support only from /biz/ dudes and reddit shills>More volume than Bitcoin itself, massive gains as Bitcoin collapsesPick one.
You realize that half of the current volume came from a single transaction in Korean moneys?Geez, I wonder what's going on!
This nigga...It has the most volume of any coin right now.
Of course he'll be able to sell it unless he's a humpback.
BTC might go down to 1000$, but it will still be valuable.. and it might rise again.
You realize that half of the current volume came from a single transaction
enjoy your bags you shilling faggot.
ALL HAIL BITCOIN CASH
