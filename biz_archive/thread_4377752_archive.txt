Reminder to always do your due diligence before investing.
It might be a $149 project.
What am I exactly looking at?
pajeet is paying someone $149 to make his shitcoin
most of the altcoins are garbage like this.
and they get millions
Beware of the upcoming low cap ICOs.A lot of people are going to imitate Confido and actually run a scam with a fancy website.It's so easy to get $400k nowadays in a couple of minutes.
Hmmm Low cap, high cap seems like ICOs are just plain shit to invest in these days...
everything right now is overvalued.
we are already in the mania phase and everyone thinks of a lambo in 2018
Too many are fooled by a nice website these days.
A quick way to make money if you're a scammer though - this person is already interviewing people.
it doesn't matter if the idea/team is good or not, low market cap ico's are doing well regardlessgood for quick profitpretty much every crypto project is run by unqualified people
