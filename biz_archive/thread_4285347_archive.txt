is 5,000 enough to make it?
I wouldn't say 'make it', but you won't be dissapointed
is 10k enough to make it?
HODLing till 2020 at the least.
TFW only 6.5k, trying desparately to get to 10k.I firmly believe that 10k LINK will be the made-it threshold.
I can't afford enough to have potential to "make" it yet, but many anons believe that 1k is enough to make a pretty penny, definitely enough for a poorfag to make it though
I want to buy more but don't want to go through BTC to buy it.
Can't buy with ETH either.
