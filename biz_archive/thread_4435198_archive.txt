I bought ASTRO a few days ago at .007 eth per ASTRO without doing any research.
Am i about to get just'd?
Should i jump ship or can someone convince me that this isn't a scam coin?
you're fucked anon.
Interdasting viewpoint.
Can you back it up?
It's holding 0.005 quite steady and it's not even on a real exchange yet
You'll be fine unless you need to sell fast.
Let it hit a real exchange first.
Are there some sort of announced plans to have it listed elsewhere?
Anon remember: The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.
Be patient.I used to panic sell and now EVERY freaking coin that I sold at a loss has successfully recovered.
FML (except Steem, seriously fuck this shit)
Any news regarding upcoming exchanges?
I'd at least stick around until Dec 30.
That's when the first derivatives are supposed to be distributed.
I'll be happy to pick up your bags anon.This coin is about to take off again.
whats the latest?
