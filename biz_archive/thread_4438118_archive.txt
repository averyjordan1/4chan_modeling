Like everyone ive been pretty bummed out from the gayness that has been coming out from VergeDev team rearding wraith.
Today i was questioning the authenticity of their rich list.
I deposited 0.1337 amount of Verge into the many accounts on verge rich list accounts.
Within less than 15 minutes, the amount which i deposited was withdrawn.
It seems no matter which account i deposit to, the same result happens.
Dont believe me, i challenge you to try sending 1 XVg to any of the accountsI tried in top 3 accounts, you can see history, and the account that had 50million XVG.
Each time i deposit 0.1337 xvg.
Within 15 minutes, that is transferred into another accountPic relatedLinks to transactions i made https://verge-blockchain.info/address/D6CHwVm4r8hvUD7QnRagVCQXZrJUbtfuzzhttps://verge-blockchain.info/address/DSPAZPNkBq7ivcxyZY3UztNYVU7rPTYEdzhttps://verge-blockchain.info/address/D76EBMSp9sRinAKk4PK74Av94SxPkrL8QLhttps://verge-blockchain.info/address/DDBLi87cUQPFzkyiXYwkJ5Ceu3PLDnL3GsFuck man.
we have been scammed.
Verge is a shitcoin....
If you didn't know Verge was shit you weren't doing enough research and probably still won't now.
I still can't believe people fell for "The Wraith Protocol ‚Äù which sounds like something that belongs in the WWE.
verge has legitimate tech behind it.
Whats not legitimate is the retarded group of developers and marketing team, that ruined reputation of the coin, regardless of how good technolgy is
What makes you think they have good tech?
You don't have to get to detailed but I'm genuinely wondering what you saw in the project.
bump for the VERGENS
You do know that before it was rebranded to verge that it was dogecoin dark, right?
there is nothing wrong with a fork from a previous coin.
VERGE - A PURE TRASHCOINHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Legitimate tech aka "slap a TOR on DOGECOIN"?
