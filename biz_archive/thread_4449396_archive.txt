Got my college debit card a few days ago.
Already asked these questions /adv/ but didn't get too many responses over there.
Is there anything I should watch out for when shopping online?
Is Paypal worth using?
Any general advice to someone who's never used a card like this before?
What do you mean by being careful?
Yup, essentially.
