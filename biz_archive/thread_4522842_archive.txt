Civic finally taking off.
Accumulation phase finished.
Vinny Lingham is not one too hype up every update and partnership and has mentioned this.
He did mention some big things are coming our way.
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
<<<<<< Big update incoming.
You better got your bags when Vinny will release it.
I lost 10% in an instant on this shitcoin.
Never again.
Yeah that's what you get for buying into PBC rumours moron.
Learn to invest instead of gamble.
Should have held ya goober.
i have 10k cvc and i am holding until it moons or diesvinny gets alot of hate but he is a good salesman for his product and made some good hard choices already
Actually this is not a shitcoin, but a solid investment.
They already have big partners but are limited to release the info because of NDA with regards to publicly listed companies
