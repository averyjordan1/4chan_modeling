You can do too.
Well, day trading in traditional markets is based off of the opening range.
You can't really do that with crypto because the exchanges never close.
Anyway all trading is based on 2 strategies: mean reversion and trend-following.
The first works best when the market is ranging in a channel: you buy the support and sell the resistance.
When price breaks out of the channel, support becomes resistance and vice-versa, so you want to be trend-following.
But the most important thing is that you must only trade in the same direction of the long-term trend.
