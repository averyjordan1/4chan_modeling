Why can't people send money to an online poker site that allows them to cash out in bitcoin and then take a deduction on taxes for gambling losses or whatever.
Help understand why this wouldn't work because I do not see why you can't send money to poker site cash out in bitcoin immediately and then say you lost the money and take a tax deduction?
had the exact question in my head, really curious to find out why it wouldnt work
If it's a legit company they have to report bitcoin withdraws like other currency.
If it's not a legit company (like the US poker scene) mostly it's hard to get money on to the site without bitcoin.
Sure it can be used somewhat for laundering but there are also playthrough requirements
Honestly seems to easy has to be a catch
All poker sites are legal to play on but illegal to run the site itself inside the US.
They're all offshore and you can use a debit/credit/moneygram to deposit
or why cant we show we deposited for example 10k$ to an exchange for cryptocurrency investments and then report a 100% loss, would that work ?
Idk if they changed the tax code for crypto losses yet but that have them online gaming/poker deductions
anon with all the hoops to even cash out paying the juden seems to look better and better as time goes onbut yeah thats one solution
