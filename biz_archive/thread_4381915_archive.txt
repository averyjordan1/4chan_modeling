So heres the deal:Im an amerifat and cant use the EU style binary options sites with the call/put gambling systems so I have to use Nadex basically.
Not only did i find out that i cant use the eu binary options sites, but if i did use them it would be a felony for me.
I'm new to it and i'd like some advice from maybe some of you guys who know whats going on with it.
Is there something better, or is this basically my only option here?Any videos on how to go pro quick or any resources you could throw my way?Is nadex good?Thanks /biz/, Sincerely, a /pol/ack
