Ignition begins.

Hmm it just jumped.
I think OP actually made the call.
my bags are feeling as heavy as her eyes
YES YES YES THE TIME HAS COME GOGOGO BITCOIN
It just exploded up to 7275What did you do OP?
Tried to warn you.
all signs point to moon
Implying institutionals buy ATH.They will crash the price to hell before buying
implying they haven't been buying for a while and now is rocket missionHow new can you be?
They won't enter until 500 billion market cap, that's a known fact.
Keep being deluded.
BULLISH
They are allocating small (for them) amounts of capital and driving the market up, once they have accumulated enough you will see an huge green candle.
When they get in fully pink wojaks of nocoiners will be all over the board.
Who's that trap?
Goldmans Sachs is in.Wait, I thought they were already in.
They are going inner.
what am i looking at here
Why did anyone ever assume a crash was going to happen with the fork?
There is some risk after the fork.
Lots of capital available to then speculate on segwit2x
Summerfags.x is dead on arrival, there was never any risk.
