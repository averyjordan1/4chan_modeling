Me stupidMe no know what Tether isMe want someone tell me what Tether is, how it works, and why I should care.
tether a shit
You pay them real money and they give you digital money.
That way, you can come back and trade back whenever you want, in theory.In reality they have to use it to pay their staff, so you can only trade back up until the point where they run out of reserve.
plus there's a good chance that bitfinex used money from tether to pay off a shitton of coins stolen from their bitfinex wallets.
its a trash-coin.
