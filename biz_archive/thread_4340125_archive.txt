Is someone still holding this?i know they had problems with the wallet, but i guess that can be fixed.
heard something about pbc but i do not trust that info.holding mid bag and selling now makes me no gains and no loses.what would anons do?
Hodll til 8$ comfy gains
HOLD IT!
Their wallet is fixed!
?
This is going to atleast 20.
Selling at 8 would be stupid.
I'll probably take some profit at 10 but most my stack isn't getting sold until 20+.
Longing this with 1.5x leverage.
The team is top notch and they're currently negotiating with new exchanges.
The market cap is criminally low for a project of this caliber.
I want to buy but the market depth on bitfinex right now is deep on the sell side.
Are you sure its a good time to buy now and why now of all times?
exactly.
People are aggressively shilling here as etp has been treading water for days while circling the drain.
For those still holding from ath just sell now before you end up like a dirty linkie.
Sold a few days ago to move into Monero while bitcoin and bitcoin cash sort out.
Afterwards I'm hoping I can pick ETP for like $2.50, in which case I'm gonna put like 80% in.
