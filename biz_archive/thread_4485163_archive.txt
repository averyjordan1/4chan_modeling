just unironically bought 100k (3 masternodes) how'd i do?
gg wp, you can now retire
I might buy another node actually
Why would you choose 3 masternodes over 1 trusted node?
1 Trusted (with alot of stake) will do more work than 3 low-tie nodes.
I don’t know what that means?
I just bought 3000 coins so I could run 3 ZNodes.
Is it better to put all 3000 in one node or something?
do you get anything from running znodes?
How do you setup the masternodes?
znode gets you 45xzc/day
month i meant
Wtf?
Is that backed up by the info graphic?
45*30 = $1,350, and that’s assuming the price stays constant
