It's not too late to accumulate.
All aboard!
The masses don't give a shit about ASIC resistance.
At this point it's pretty clear most people don't even really care about point of sale cryptocurrencies for every day purchases.In 3 months time this coin will be completely forgotten, bleeding away with its uncles Swarm City, LBRY Credits, Iconomi etc.
You literally just posted the biggest sell signal possible.
Was this your plan all along?
Please sell me your coins, I'll take them all.
If steady 500% gains over a 3 month period is a sell signal to you, good luck in crypto, you're not going to make it.
This is just the beginning.
Look back at LTCs charts from when it started it's moon mission.
You would kick the shit out of yourself if you sold at $5
should i wait for a dip or buy now?
This is me x2.
Please give us your wisdom OP.
I was hoping for a little dip to buy big at ~$3.50 but idk if its worth it...
You should have bought at 2 dollars eks dee
In other words just buy now and wait 2 months
