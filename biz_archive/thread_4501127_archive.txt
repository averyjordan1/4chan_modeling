BITBAY>developer holds over 100 million bitbays in his personal wallet, which is 10% of the supply>outdated wallet>marketplace looks like its from the early 90's>marketplace constantly crashes, is buggy, god awful UI and its resource hoarding as all hell>you are not allowed to sell child pornography, guns, illegal drugs or fake money on the marketplace, which would be the only reason to actually use a decentralized marketplace>developer will most likely cash out and disappear once he can sell his coins at 0.10$literally a pyramid coin, no thanks

web walletand the crowd goes wild
Im a longterm supporter of bitbay, but this is barely anything to be excited about
