This is what Teeka said about GAS in the PBC newsletter from September -"Here’s why I think the price move in GAS could be significantly higher.GAS is much rarer than ether.There are almost 100 million ether tokens.
As of this writing, there are only about 14 millionGAS tokens.By this time next year, there will be barely 30 million GAS tokens.You see, unlike ether, GAS is restricted.
It will take 22 years before the full supply of 100 millioncoins hit the market.When all this China drama blows over—the world will be scrambling for GAS.By next year, NEO could have a larger user base than Ethereum… making it one of the mostvaluable projects in the world.Under that scenario, $100 per GAS token would be a very cheap price.Assuming that NEO does indeed become a state-sponsored blockchain champion, we caneasily see $300+ GAS prices.

As you can see GAS/NEO ratio has gone up over time.Currently is about 0.7 which is where it was when both NEO and GAS pumped due to Segwit2X cancellation.Yesterday it was about 0.65.
GAS pumps more but also dumps more.GAS can function as currency due it is being divisible.
Capable of 10000 transactions per second is pretty nice too.Very low supply compared to Ethereum.
