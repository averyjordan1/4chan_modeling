Guys i feel like i have an addiction.
I would stay glued to the bittrex wait for a coin to pump then try and buy it after it dips.
I did this with POT when it pumped and made $200 in literally 30 seconds cuz of how volatile it was but now I think I fucked it up this time.
I bought GBYTE at 0.03650000 sats and it didnt go up.
I guess my buy high and sell high strat didn't last very long.
Now I will hodl this coin and become a believer in a product i didn't even read about.
How many of you out there are like this?
btw GBYTE is pretty undervalued if you ask me.
Just look at the ATH chart.
hehe xd
You should look at Wild Crypto.Global gambling coin
literally went all in on GBYTE.
I have like 0.0019 bitcoin left cuz that's all i could sell at a profit when i bought it.
New strat is but DOGE coin and short it.
If you think about it.
If i buy at 15 sats then it goes up to 16 sats thats like 6-7% gain amirite?
Do that everyday and it grows at an exponential function.
Ill be buying more bitcoin with fiat to probably dump into alts and just accumulate alts.
Bitcoin is obviously in a bubble.
When it crashes I think we'll see all that institutional money pump into legit coins with products out and luckily GBYTE already has a working product.
