Buy Bitcoin, and ignore all scam fud about it.
Also ignore any scam fomo about any other shitcoins, in cluding forks of Bitcoin.
Especially scams claiming some shitcoin fork of Bitcoin is the real bitcoin.
This is a fud chart.
The coin being fuded is Bitcoin.
Study it well.
id Faghuh what a shocker.
Yeah you are retarded, Ive never been scammed, only cattle get scammed
If you hear about it on /biz/ it's prob a bad bet.
Ultimately, it's too late.
You will be too close to the peak to profit.
Ask yourself why people are shilling X coin?
Short answer, it's because they want you to raise the value of the coin they themselves bought.
It doesn't matter what coin it is.
Only by having more people buy the coin will it raise in value.
No matter how they put it, it's a pyramid scam (or euphemistically, multi-level marketing).Tulip Mania 2.0
