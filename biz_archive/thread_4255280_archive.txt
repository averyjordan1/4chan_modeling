just heard these guys XST announced Ledger supportstill nothing for XMR...
They are working on Monero.
It's harder to implement XMR because it isn't based on Bitcoin, that's also why the GUI wallet took so long.
Stealthcoin is a sleeping giant that is finally seeing decent volume, glad to see them plugging along
indeed, XMR support is going to come one day or another, I think we'll see that happen somewhere in december
