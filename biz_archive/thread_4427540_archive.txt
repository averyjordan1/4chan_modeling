BUT NOTHING... can beat binance.
Holy chit that advanced mode is so smooth and nice.
I love that chit.
Thanks.
You're right OP nothing beats the binance user experience.I hope they make it less bot friendly though.
The bots can be very annoying on low volume trading pairs.
Does binance do bittrex-tier assault on privacy (submitting id scans) or is it chill like bitfinex?
I really like Binance interface but is it true they force you to have 2FA to withdraw?
Does anyone know if WinAuth works with Binance?
Binance has shitty charts, poloniex is better

 btc daily withdrawal limit with no ID.
100 Btc daily with ID
liqui is not "okay tier"
Kraken is such a slow piece of shit.
I had to panic sell BCH way below market price during the big dip because it always takes like 10 tries to get an order through

Elder god teirBitmex
I did my first trade on binance.
after reading many conflicting reviews about exchanges I was between binance, bitmex or bittrex.
I saw at least 2 posts last night calling it gay and I couldn't even log in during peak trading...Binance ftw
Nice.
