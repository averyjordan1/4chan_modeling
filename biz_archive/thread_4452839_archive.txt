I'm now the proud owner of 2 bitcoins..
I finally took the plunge and invested in bitcoin after being a nocoiner for so long and being afraid of taking the plunge but I finally did thanks largely to /biz/'s advice.
Let's all enjoy the ride to 10k and beyond :-)

I don't care if it goes down.
I'm here for the long haul.
HODL baby :-)
