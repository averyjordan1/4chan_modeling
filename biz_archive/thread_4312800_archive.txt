The reality is that BTC won't go anywhere as long as Coinbase supports it.But amid the chaos you can easily make gains.
To 2x on BCH you basically need to believe the flippening will 100% happen at this point.
IE it's a very bad gamble.However you can make some nice money as people hide in good tested alts.
Here is one example.
yea buy the coin that gone up 35000%
Am hiding in XMR for now.
Pretty comfy as I gradually see my BTC value rise.
I'll buy back before the BCH difficulty adj.
