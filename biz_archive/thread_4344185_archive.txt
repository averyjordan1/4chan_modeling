I have 7K XLM right now, thinking of quadrupling that for the long haul.
Thoughts?Pic unrelated
I got 300k, gonna hold a couple years I see it taking significant market share from XRPright now all eyes are on BCH/BTC war so there are bound to be good buy oppurtunities in alts
The only thing Im worried about with lumens is them manipulating it to peg the price at some low arbitrary number like rippleI dont know if that was one of the problems that caused mccaleb to jump ship, but I hope XLM doesnt go down that road
now is not the time to jump from XLM at all.
Everyone of their communities trippled while XRP's community is on suicide watch.
Lots of conversations/debates about a FinTech Flippening
Damn.
If XLM takes off AT ALL you're going to have a very good time.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm thinking of jumping further into the XLM ship.
Not out.Or did you mean to advise against this?
it was a reply to  - who thinks the price is locked in.
remember Ripple was $0.007752 a year ago Lumens was $0.001789 a year ago Lumens - at the very least should be pushing .10
Gotcha, missed that reply tag.Good points re: the numbers.
