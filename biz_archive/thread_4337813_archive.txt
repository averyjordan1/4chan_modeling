>only two countries in the world make their citizens pay taxes when living abroad, Eritrea (fucking ERITREA) and the USwhat the FUCK /biz/.
I hate the US, nowhere else cucks its own people this hard.
I want to cash out in somewhere like Singapore, the Cayman Islands or Monaco but I fucking can't because Uncle Sam will track me down and fuck me in the ass.
Either that or he'd go in dry when I try to come back home through the airport.
>the land of the free
implying I'd tell the fucking truth to (((The Fed)))HAHAHAHAHAHA, fuck them
Moving gives you 100k to exclude per year LOL.
If you can sustain this low amount yearly then that's one way.Also good luck opening a bank account with a us passport LOL
And how do you plan on getting away with it?
