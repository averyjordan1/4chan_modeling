>be me>just finish college>mom dies of rug overdose>squeeze out meager $5,000 inheritance from estate sale cause she spent everything on pills>decide to invest in crypto to try to make it grow>been in for a month and investment has only gone down>getting addicted to this fucking crypto game, just want to make a little bit of money to make something good out of a shitty situation>feel like a fucking failure because I see all these threads of big gains and can't make any myselfWhat do I need to do to get good at this /biz?
This is not ironic either, seriously looking for support and advice.
Never underestimate rugs
Stop making big bets throwing your money around hoping to strike it big.
Make a series of small bets on coins that will increase in value in the next couple of months

The safest examples would be ETH, LTC, XMR etc
Keep chasing pajeet pumps on /biz/.
Crypto is your rug addiction, and will lead to your death.
> mom dies of addiction> son takes money and loses it to addiction
Been doing that essentially.
Have majority in LTC, ETH, ARK, VTC--have a few reach coins with SUB and ENJ (got in at the ICO and regret it because shit is down significantly from ICO price)I'm also pissed because I've nearly made a bunch of calls that I didn't end up investing in and then they started mooning (IOTA, STORJ, ETP)
Stop listening to these threads.
The whole point is to give you fomo so you will buy their shitcoins.
The circle of life
Better than using it to buy pills, but yes, I see the irony
Become a electrician,plumber, or carpenter.
/biz/ doesn't know shit, or else you would see real estate threads and real business threads.

>rug overdosestopped reading right there
Make legitimate post about my mother fucking killing herself >lol you said rug lol dumb cunt mother Thanks for the feels, /biz
