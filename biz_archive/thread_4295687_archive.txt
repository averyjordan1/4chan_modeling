I am glad I didn't buy in during ICO as I originally planned.
It's an existing company and they have announced several partnerships 5 days ago.
I guess nobody have them on their radar because it didn't pump too much yet, but people are accumulating, it can't fall much more with this good news, even with todays BCC bullshit it stayed stable.
And it has a ton of potential for growth.
Easy 10x in Q1 2018.
Read about it, but better don't miss it.Partnerships (copied from announcement):Grupo PRISA—world’s leading Spanish and Portuguese-language media group.OmiseGO—fully public and decentralized payment and exchange platform.TCL/Alcatel/Hawk—top-10 global mobile phone manufacturer selling products in over 160 countries.Their Platform is releasing start of 2018, Only trading on Etherdelta at the moment, new ones coming EOY, expect a pump then.It's worth the etherdelta struggle, good luck.
I've been in since ICO, bought some at a low of 0.09$.
Whenever crypto currencies become more mainstream, that is when it will pump.
