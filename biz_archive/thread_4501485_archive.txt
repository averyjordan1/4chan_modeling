What's your opinion on airdrops?
I made 800$ digging up some old eth addresses to generate elixir (timereum) and was wondering if it's still a fad with all the shitty ICOs and stuff?
Teach me senpai
nothing to teach friendo, a guy gave me a tip about that airdrop ages ago and I simply forgot.
The tokens from the genesis addresses were worth like 3000$ at one moment months ago so I felt kinda bad for not watching it and selling it just now for 4 times less.
