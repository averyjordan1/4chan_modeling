The ICO ended a couple of weeks ago.
It's not officially listed anywhere yet, but you can trade it on ED.
ICO was 12500 for 1 Eth, but they ended up burning a ton of tokens so there are only around 250,000,000 left.
They have a legit platform already Herosphere.gg.
I would guess it will 2-3x once it hits real exchanges, but as always DYOR.
