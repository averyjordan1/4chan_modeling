Rate my holdings, its only half, got the other half on binance.
Got them at low price.
Diversify less.
I turned 1300 to 2500 by doing that though, I mean it worked out right?
You were right this time, so you must be right all the time!
Why would I want to listen to someone who has had more experience than myself!?
Seriously kid, listen to him.
Just because you got lucky now doesn't mean you will later.
Have you not seen the pink wojak threads when BTC spiked from 5k to 7k?
It's about to start again, better prepare yourself or your alts will suffer.
Considering you don't have much money, I would suggest going all in on Neo and selling the news on Monday and then diversify back into your coins.
Well except Lisk.
I was making quite a lot of money on binance too on that run up...I didn't get why people was posting those when btc was increasing
my acc on binance
Not saying to get rid of ALL your alts, but you should reconsider some of them and put them back in BTC or a coin like NEO that is currently running up.
I did have 14 NEO I bought at 360k sats, sold like 6 at 510k sats, not looking for entry since I'm still holding some
You like giving bittrex free NEO gas and ark?
Put that shit on a hardware wallet faggot
I' only trade coins not use them
I have a lot of experience and I think diversification is good in crypto.You don't need to make al your bets all or nothing.
At least move your NEO over to Binance where they pay gas dividends monthly instead of supporting an exchange like bittrex which blatantly steals gas from NEO holders
okay, I forgot that binance did that.
I wish that one day I will be able to accumilate like you guys and be able to allocate my money to staking NEO ARK etc.
