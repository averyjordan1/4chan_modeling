Ok /biz i need your opinion on my thoughts.If you followed recent events in PnD you have seen Storj and Lisk pumps, which were pumped to $0.91 and $11.15 cents respectively.I had an idea to identify next potential target for PnD, i have spent quite a bit of time on this and i came to conclusion that next likely target is SONM, here is my reasoning:Both LISK and Storj have deep relationship with SONM, like Max Kordek(LiSK's President) being SONM's advisor, and Storj signing a technical agreement with them.
If we look at SONM's price in recent couple of days we can see a very peculiar anomalies, someone buys everything that gets close to 9 cents, Although they fucked up at the beginning and bought over 350k in one swoop couple of days ago.
In December - January SONM will have major technical events(release of test net), and this dates will likely be used as a trigger to start a pump as they present real "value" updates.
and yeah i know:> hur dur shill your shitcoin harderbut can we actually take a serious look at something once in a while.
