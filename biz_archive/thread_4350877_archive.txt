For quite some time, Eric Gu and the team has mentioned that they have been in talks with the Dubai Government, Bittrex, and Binance.
There are rumors circulating that there might be a partnership announcement & exchange listing concurrently anytime from now onwards right after the BCH fork.
More over, look at https://www.thinkmarkets.comThey listed 12 heavyweights coins (BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, DASH, MONERO, NEO, BCH, OMG, IOTA, BTG, ZCASH)Guess who join in the ranks of these heavyweights?
Metaverse ETP
Thanks for the info.
Iâ€™m buying this
oh fuck you're not kidding
well that sorts the liquidity problem for US customers holy shit
This is kinda big..
Thanks OP.
Did some more research and apparently they added ETP October 30th.
Doesn't subtract from how big this is though
ever get the feeling etp team holds stuff back?
that or they just aren't good at projecting to their community/great crypto field advancements
I don't have any idea, I've never even looked into this coin until I saw this thread.
(So I guess you're right.)
I don't have a Bitfinex account otherwise I'd invest some.
do they have slack or anything that we can get up to date information?
Can I buy once this his Binance or would that be too late?
Coins usually pump with the announcement and dump with the listing so it'd probably be too late
Please be binance.lol I love this coin but theres no volume on HITBTC.
