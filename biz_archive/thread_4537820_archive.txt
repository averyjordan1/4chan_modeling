There is a thing, but its a fight between miners not a serious attempt to dethrone the King
No clue desu
If the Chinese miners abandon BTC it's game over for Blockstream.
C'mon Jihan, it's Jihad time!
IfYesterday you said "when".
Nervous, bro?
between minersNo, the miners are with BCH.
It's a fight between on the one side miners, a bunch of old guard bitcoiners and devs, and on the other side blockstream and their institutional shekel backers and useful goys who willingly get all their information and discussions on subreddits that are heavily censored.
can someone post that whiteboard pic with the "plan" written on it
% of miners were not with you last time, and it'll be worse for BCH next time
Just keep watching the unconfirmed transactions, when it's about to happen it will get clogged up by defenders of BTC trying to keep people from sending their funds, just like last time.
start questioning btc>realize it's the biggest shitcoin of them all>realize all bitcoins are shitcoins>bitcoin supply just quadrupled >be in altsCongrats on this seriously
