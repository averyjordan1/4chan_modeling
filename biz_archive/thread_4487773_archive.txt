The Internet of People (IoP) is a complete infrastructure for apps and payments that is not server based.
Instead, it is completely decentralized and based on nodes.
Those nodes could run on home computers or even smaller devices like a Raspberry Pi (fully) or smartphone (in part).The IoP token is a currency that is used for payments on the IoP.
It also grants holders a share in the Internet of People as a decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO).Bluepaper and roadmap is coming in 1 day 1 hours.
