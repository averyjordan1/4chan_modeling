I wanted to invest vertcoin but its crashing, is veri coin good?I am balls deep in Vericoin since 2014.
It was mooning back then until the Mintpal hack and the subsequent first ever blockchain rollback.It has not recovered since, but there is no reason why it shouldn't rise in price again.
It is a solid coin with moon potential.Also pretty neat, it's the first Alt-coin to have a facility in the wallet that allows you to send Vericoin to a Bitcoin wallet via Veribit auto-conversion.https://twitter.com/VeriCoinhttps://www.youtube.com/user/vericoinchannel/videosAlso it is proof of stake so you gain interest every day.
I get a few Vericoin each day
furrycoin, cuckcoin
what is proof of stake?furrycoin sounds interesting
what is proof of stake?You gain interest on what you keep in your wallet essentially.
