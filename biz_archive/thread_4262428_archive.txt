DESU, I bought NULS at .10 and sold at .16 just now.
I think it will retrace, RSI reads 86, way overbought.Just pure fomo, no team, no whitepaper, it will retrace and then probably go for another run later.Rebuy point .10-.11
You're gonna have a bad time bro.
Can you retards keep it in one thread?
Was nobody else here really trading when ETH was going up 20% an hour?nuls has all the potential to do that.in the words of a truly great trader "Things haven't gone parabolic until people are shitting themselves and calling their blow dealer"
JUST.
Sorry Anon
It won't retrace before the English wp is out.
It will slowly go up until then...
Did you even read what I typed?White paper and team info will be released in 3,5 hours.
