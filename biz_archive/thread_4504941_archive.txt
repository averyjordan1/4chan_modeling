Ok so I bought Blockfolio Bitcoin Exchange on Google Play Store.I have filled out some buy orders and made my portfolio, however I now wish to sell some of my items which Im in over 2x profit with.I still havent gotten any invoice from blockfolio, is it possible to sell before getting my invoice or is selling only possible after you have actually paid for your different bitcoins like LINK or the Token Ethereums.I think if I sell before paying the invoice I get the difference right?
Would love to save some on the transaction fees :D
yes
new meme
Ok m8 so I just added 100LINK bitcoins on my blockfolio exchange, first:1.
Tell me how to move it to a wallet2.
How do u buy stuff with it on Amazon.3.
As i think, LINK only costs 16cents now, 1 bitcoin is 8300.
Basically link is a coin so it should go up, also according to my boyfriend.So you have to help me, this blockfolio bitcoin is hard to use its unfair!
