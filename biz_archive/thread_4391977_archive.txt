Wait a minute, why is Onchain not using NEO?
It's creating another blockchain instead.
Has NEO been overhyped?https://www.meetup.com/Onchains-Blockchain-Project-Launch-NEO-Ecosystem-Sharing/events/245101761/?eventId=245101761
Because NULS is the real Chinese ETH.
hahahhaha you thought they would be using neo?
hahhhahahaha neo has nothing except for coz you know why eric gu started his own chain metaverse right?
because he knows how to get real partnerships
Been wondering that, why did he co-found Antshares then go on to Metaverse instead.. did he know about the extent of NEO partnerships?
