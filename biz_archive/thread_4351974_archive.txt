is this it bois?
are we finally going to the sun?
?
I think it's BTC pumping and taking ETH with it.
Oh thanks for letting me know ETH broke $320 again I wasn't paying much attention and still have 30 million in ICO bags to dump.
can i have some

Top kek
bitfinex walls back at 318, 319, 320every fucking $ increase requires at least a million to get through, good luck pumping eth again without any news and normies buying in masse

Guys, ETH is going up because of the smartcontract bug locking up so much ETH, people are already talking about a fork to revert the bug.Like last time with ETC.That's why ETH is rising.
It's true: https://paritytech.io/blog/security-alert.html300M of ETH stuck behind smart contracts that have been killed off due to shitty design: https://github.com/paritytech/parity/issues/6995And just like last time, people are talking about a fork.
Forks have become the new ICO's.>In May 2016, a venture capital fund called The DAO built on Ethereum raised around $168 million, with the intention of investing in projects using smart contracts.
[8] In the same month a paper was released detailing security vulnerabilities with The DAO that could allow ether to be stolen.
[9] In June, 3.6 million Ether (approximately $50 million USD) was taken from accounts in The DAO and moved to another account without the owners' consent, exploiting one of the vulnerabilities that had been raised in May.
Members of The DAO and the Ethereum community debated what actions, if any, should occur to resolve the situation.
A vote occurred and in July 2016 it was decided to implement a hard fork in the Ethereum code and to move the Ether taken in the exploit to a new smart contract through which it would be restored to the owners from whom it had been taken.
[10]>Ethereum Classic came into existence when some members of the Ethereum community rejected the hard fork on the grounds of "immutability", the principle that the blockchain cannot be changed, and decided to keep using the unforked version of Ethereum.
[11]^^^ What happened last time something like this happened.
