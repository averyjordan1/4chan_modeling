it's no usebcc holders will always shill about "muh flippening" whenever they canit's really annoying
this is one of the laziest ((((blockstream))) shill threads all day, they should fire you pajeet
fuck you cuck.
I don't own any of that shit.
uses the word cuck without context to try to fit inyou're too obvious rajish
yea case I expect to shill a 1k coin on /biz/ in hopes that you faggots had the balls to pump it
I just tried Eclair wallet LN transactions on bitcoin testnet and it works perfectly fine.
It will be operational on mainnet before 2-3 months and make bcash completely obsolete.
