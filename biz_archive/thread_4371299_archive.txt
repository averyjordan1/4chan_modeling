Ok, who's the fag that was hyping LTC that something was happening at 6:30 EST ?
the returns are lukewarm.
Lesson learned.
Never trust /biz/
Be patient.
Just wait, shits just warming up.That anon only said to get in by 6:30.
Good shit is just starting

that fag dumped his bags on you at 530pm while you were trying to get inLOL
dumped>Shit is only going higher
Except on that altcoin which I kept telling all you about but no one listened.
See how you missed out on 3000x gains?Next altcoin will be ARK.
Buy now or miss out forever.
WE MOONING!Drops for the next 5 hours.
the price was low at 5:30 lol.
If anything that wouldve been one of the better times to buy back in
lowers value relative to BTCYou fucking trogladyte, BTC is going up, of course it is worth less sat.
In USD its only been going upsee:
i take back everything i posted it's starting to MOON
OP I think it has to deal with SQUARE adding BTC, BCH, and LTC (not ETH - yet)
Novogratz tweeted it earlier tonight.Rest I've heard from a private Discord groupthat most people have heard of.
source on SQUARE accepting LTC?
