Will you tell me the story about how you made millions in crypto by doing thorough research, being disciplined with your trades, and investing in promising emerging blockchain technologies again?God I'm so happy I have a man like you and not a weak-handed P&D shilling shitcoiner or a disgusting pajeet!
ya sweetie, i bought bitcoin and held it for 15 years
shut up bitch, I'm not paying you Link by the hour to talk.
Nah hun I went all in on some shitcoin and got a couple of weak spined NEETs to buy my bags through a couple of discord and telegram groups.
research>discipline>techIf anybody is seriously stupid enough to do this they deserve all the losses they get.
You think blindly buying into every coin shilled here is the way to go, noob?
How come you always forget about my beginnings with the kneepads?
It's the best part!

I went all in on Zap.Store

Crypto is spastic.
