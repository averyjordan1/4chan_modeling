Been months since I've been here but I am looking for your great wisdom /biz/.I quit highschool and have been working minimum wage for a while and I am wondering what course could I take to get a decent paying job.
I was thinking mechanics then getting a job as a driver and later truck (lorry in uk) driver or a barber course.
What else could I work, any ideas?
