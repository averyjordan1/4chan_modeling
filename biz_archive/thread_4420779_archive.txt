>Want to convert ANYTHING into Bitcoin>Exchanges will take exactly half of my money>Transfer fees will take another 10%Why even bother?
A better question is why are you making up ridiculous numbers?
Exchange fees are usually only .1%, nowhere close to 50%.
I've never looked at a fee, ever.
I've made thousands of trades.I've made over 20x my money in crypto.
I became a millionaire in 8 months.You are a poor faggot, get out if you can't handle .1% fees in the greatest bullmarket of our lifetimes.
