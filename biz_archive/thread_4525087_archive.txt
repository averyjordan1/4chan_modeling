alright guys this is the total earnings my business made this yeardo i stick it all in BTC or ETH?
what do i do to maximize my gains here
eth ofc, btc is in shitstorm right now not a good entry point atm.
OMG
ETH, XMR or BTH
90% eth, rest up to you but some shitcoins will do
?Clearly this is a sketchy business.
Check yourself, invest in America, invest in Trumpcoin.
ETH needs to level out today if tomorrow back to $390 OMG is at a perfect entry point.
They have big news coming before 2018 will easily be $14+ETHOS is going to moon up to $5-$10 mid 2018 LTC probably $120 by EOY 2018BTCSilver maybe good to grab see it going to $150+ overnight
well?what kind of business is that?
ETH is a good investment.
Once it switches to Proof of Stake you will make passive income of a king.
definitely not some shitcoin.go ETH
>earnings my business made>$350K>which crypto?Fucking do the business instead!!
