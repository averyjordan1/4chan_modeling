$8,000 BTCLET'S SEE IT
I'M READY BOY
i submit these digits for the BTC
Got my sell order ready


imagine being the first person to place that magical $8000 buy order... glorious....
this pump seems rather unhealthy infact you can tell all previous months before this one what was happening, all billionaires moving their money into crypto with a correction every week.
however this past month has been rather emotional even for Bitcoin

I love watching these milestones...come on BTC - i need to work - not watch fucking charts!!!!
>when BCH tries to take down the king
already hit 8k on buttfinex
>the flippening happening
bitcoin will go to 8.2k and then correct 40% screencap this
$7960 on bitstamp my angus is peppered
7970 on binance!
I'd rather place the $8000 sell.
Shut it down.
>all dat teasing just short
no
getting rekt
It already broke through 8000 on finex.
Such a cocktease ... FUCK!
STOP THE TEASING
Doesn't this mean that BTC is basically viable as a currency due to its atomic swap with LTC?
HAIL TO THE KING
There are people on this board RIGHT NOW who have short arms and heavy bags of $880 BCH
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T BUY AT ATH BUT I'M SO FUCKING TEMPTED TO THROW SOME MONEY IN HELP ME!
BCH WAS AND ALWAYS WILL BE .1 OF A BTC.
WHY DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THIS?
COME HOME CHINA MAN!
WAKE UP !!
The LN dev with LTC side piece plus announced privacy development mitigates the small block slow transaction talk.
Whether you buy now or at the next dip, thereâ€™s no reason to believe you will lose your investment
I'm still up 400% - not even sweating, holding till 250k
More power to you!
(Just as its not hashing power from the One True Chain)
:00 CST
BTC is a shitcoin ponzi scheme and it's currently in a gigantic bubble.
Won't be long before it pops.BCH will rule them all
HERE WE GO
having arms that short>having bags that heavy
stop teasing pls I have no precum left
As I said I'm not sitting on heavy bags I'm sitting on heavy profits.
BTC is a shitcoin and you'd be smart to cash out before the market dumps on you.Whenever BTC experiences its next drop it's going to die.
any minute now
It's like getting a constant blowjob I swear to godI can't wait for the next dip so I can get fucking moar
Whenever BTC experiences its next drop it's going to die.Didn't die going down to $5400 and 180k unconfirmed transactions.
It won't be taken down by BTC with one line of code changed
imagine buying high and selling lowTypical /biz/
HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOO
SO CLOSE
New DAA will ensure BCH remains more profitable for much much longer than BTC this time, the only thing that saved BTC last weekend was a DDOS attack on bitthumb during the flippening.
8k>highAnon...
8k!!!!!
Whenever BTC experiences its next drop it's going to die.said-increasingly-nervous-man-seventh-time-this-hour.jpg

STOP TEASING SATOSHI I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE
betting on pedocoin
s-sauce
OH NO NO NO
The meme lines are too strong.
FUUUCK GOOOOO
This shit has taken so long to hit 8k that It feels like it's going to crash like a motherfucker when it does.
GOOO, YOU MOTHERFUCKER, GOOO!This motherfucking coin, I'm still a wage cuck and it's 2am here.
this is just ridiculous
Or we can expect a moon from all people shorting while a whale push the price up to liquidate ?
it already hit 8k on poloniex, wtf you guys
hasnt on normiebase
SAME GO TO 10K ALREADY
lana rain pirate cosplay
There is a section of the chart at 5k that hasn't been retraced to.
Layer your buys on the way down but expect the real possibility that it goes that far.
Probably no lower though.
poloniexWho cares, GDAX or it didn't happen.
I'm going in for more at like 6k to be safeToo lazy to watch 24/7

Can somebody explain to a filthy fucking newfag how BTC is x number on coinbase, y number according to coindesk, and z number according to poloniex?
Different echanges
Each exchange trades independently.
The prices are consolidated through arbitrage.

JUST HIT IT ALREADY
we need the hit>hit 8k>normie (((Journalists))) make new articles about new all time high>more normie cash comes in>we get richer
Guess it just isn't in the cards tonight.
Still with how close it is it'll probably be soon we see $8k across the board
NO NO NO NO NO NO MOMMY MOMMYWHY IS IT GOING DOWN MOMMY??
?AAAAAAHHHH
NOOO I BOUGHT AT $7950WTF IS HAPPENING
Fuck
Why did you choose to buy in when BTC is at an all-time high?
Not trying to be a dick or anything, but it seems like you could get a better bang for your buck if you re-evaluated your purchasing timing.
FUCK JUST BOUGHT 10 COINS AT $7983 WTF DO I DO IT WAS MY ENTIRE SAVING
reminds me of not being anthony burchEvery day I remind myself that at least I'm not that guy.
Its retards LARPing, I'll never understand people who find amusement from pretending to be retarded.
IT'S GOING DOWN, IT'S CRASHING WITH NO SURVIVORS!!!!!!

SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL
flippening
BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE 8K WAS GOING TO HAPPEN FOR SURE.
being this fucking retarded.
BTC held strong between 7k and 7.6k for over a week until the Bcash catastrophe which only brought it down to between 5.5k and 6k.
So it will test 8k for a week and 10k by christmas.
After that, who the fuck knows.
BUY THE DIP BUY THE DIP BUY THE DIP, AFTER THIS DIP IT GOES PAST 8K
>getting justed by some meme lineslmao nice currency of the future you got there
For the love of God just hold onto it.
Don't sell low, be patient and wait for the next spike.
