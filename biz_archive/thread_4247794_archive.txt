Hey /biz/ my bf recently told me to put some money into btc.
So I bought btc, looked around and started investing in alts with moderate success.
I've been going all in on single positions and day trading - question can my gains be sustained or should I switch it up.
I've been seeing people on here get 5x in October and I'm wondering how do I achieve such gains.
It's not that I'm discontent with my 2x it's Just that I feel like I'm not doing well.
I've invested in Monaco at first and then sold right before it crashed and now am trading TKN (tokencard).
Thanks for the tips anons
