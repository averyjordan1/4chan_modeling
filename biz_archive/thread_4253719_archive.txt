anyone else having problems with withdrawal?
Suddenly my 2FA didn't work and i got suspended for 2 hours for too many login attempts
Not there but on fucking Coinbase yeah.
Coming on an hour and ETH withdrawal still only 'pending'.
Nah man.
Comfy and cozy as fuck with my steady climbing bag of $NULS
it was showing 2fa is turned off, even when I never turned it off.
dont know whats wrong
Ya this just killed me tried to arbitrage nuls and my withdrawal got delayed for 2 hours.
This is literally 9k that I lost, fuck me.
exit scamcz is running away with your precious LINK
Can't withdrawal because they trading ur coins with their bots
man i am losing money every minute
Yes, everyone is.
Until they move some coins out of cold storage nothing will get processed.
Actually I just checked and their wallet which hadn't had any transactions for the past 3 hours just started moving 5 minutes ago.
Shouldn't be too long now.
yep, my BTC been stuck as I watch the XMR ratio go up
thanks for the info man really helped
