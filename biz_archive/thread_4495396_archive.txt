In the future there will be a coin that allows people to make money by carpool/"uber"ing with electric vehicles that logs the distance driven.
Each passenger pays their fair share easily from their phone which could even allow for better deals and spitting the cost of rides.
Also you'll never have to dispute ride costs as it'll be a pre-agreed upon rate.This coin is a necessity because all of the people that missed out on massive crypto-gainz are going to have to chauffeur us around when we don't feel like driving our moon lambos.
That will literally never happen.
Why use a new currency when there are so many that are already available for use?
green id confirms this
implying all coins wont be interchangeable in the future>implying uber will last forever>implying decentralized technology won't completely change the planet
