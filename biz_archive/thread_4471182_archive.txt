I have 5 brand new RX570 GPUs that I was planning on flipping on eBay.
Is it worth mining anything now or should I just get rid of them?
I'm tempted to just set them up on a cheap mobo with ethOS and just forget about them for six months and see what happens.
Retarded?
Should have mentioned that I'm looking at ETH, since it has the potential to increase in value and isn't excessively pajeet.
