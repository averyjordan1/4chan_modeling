Portfolio is a shit show right now, tried day trading but just getting reqt because I can't dedicate enough time to it.
Think I'm too diversified, any tips biz?Looking to redistribute and then maybe come back in 3 months or so and take things from there
put everything into bitcoin right now
That's stupid.
The only way to outgrow Bitcoin is to go for an alt that can outgrow Bitcoin.
Right now it's looking like the only one that can do that is Bitcoin Cash which is HUGELY undervalued at the moment.
Not sure I believe in bitcoin cash enough
Yeah I should have done that a while ago, it's just hard parting with these alt bags
