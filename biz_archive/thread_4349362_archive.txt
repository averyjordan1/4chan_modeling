put dad all in on REQeasiest decision of 2017
Yup, what do you think I've been trying to do for the past 3 months?
Lol.
Suck my dick, dad.
"Sucks that the mainstream investors are in on it now though, the gains are getting fewer and farther between.
And also, suck my dick".Also what kind of brokering fee should I charge him
bamp, is it a bad idea to charge him a small friendly fee for investing, and do a little research for him and manage the portfolio nicely; or just do it for free and throw the principal into a few alts and just leave it?
Just make sure you don't lose it
The market is too unpredictable to promise any specific returns.Why don't you ask him yourself?You could set it up like this.The first 100% there is no fee, this will give your dad confidence that you can at least double his money.
However, after 100% ROI you will charge a 20% fee.
Or he could just take the money and run.
