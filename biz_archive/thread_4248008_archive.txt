Hey boys time to make /biz/ great again.
I have a coin on my radar that will be mooning soon.
So get in quick.Gimli is an esports betting token backed by a few big name pro-players.
DYOR...its got a good team and solid project.
Its market cap is currently 1.5m and priced less than 2 cents.Buy in now thank me tomorrow.
Been looking at this for a while.
Not sure if I want to get in on it though.
