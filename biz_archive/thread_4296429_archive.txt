Looking at the history...it's not likely this thing will go away today and drop to $200.
I believe we get one or maybe even two days of action in this.
Thoughts?

This.
It's still a fraction of the sats it once was.
it will moon to at least $2000 after november 13bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin, deal with it corecucks
Switch to one hour candles look at BTC then look at BCC then tell me which train you would rather be on
small exchanges are considering to add BitcoinCash as a base marketThats good news for Bitcoin Cash https://twitter.com/TradeSatoshi/status/929135341964992512
Small exchange is thinking (but really just putting a vote of interest up which doesn't show complete confidence) about carrying BCH because it will bring more people to their small exchange and BCH is hot right nowWhoop-de-doo
If you have to post a fake chart to try and make your shitcoin look good, your shitcoin is just that, a shitcoin.
Enjoy the fall cucks.
Could probably hit 1200$ eventually and gradually sell off for a long time
