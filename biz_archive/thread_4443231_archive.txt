without them we're going back to 0.00010250
Buy this on etherdelta please guys
Is this related to the release of their revised whitepaper?
You're right in this regard.
I sold my bitbean for a profit a month or more back.
just looked at the charts, I'd be JUSTed right now if I was still hodling bitbean.
im always right bud
lol, only really one buy order propping it up now.
we're going back down shortly.But I'm always right, and we're at a disagreement.
Which means you must be wrong.
Sorry to break it to you champ.
stay poor
No.
people are still holding NULSLmao, I bet you are the ones that I sold my bags to at $1 lol
Seriously this meme series and others from /biz/ should be collected and turned into a comic book.
I'd fucking buy it these are glorious.
4444087yeah we all sold at $1 and rebought lower.
Several times.
mooningWell I'm now $30 in profit instead of being $1k loss so I guess that's a moon of sorts.
just dont become a deluded linkie and ulll make money
DELET

I saved that pic too.
What I really like is how when it's uptrending it's consistently more expensive on Bit-Z which means Asians do like it.

also 
I saw that so it is confirmed, nuls is a moon mission.
Told you so.
Fuck I was shilling the shit out of it last week too.
At least for a few days after based whale anon gave the tip.
a whole week under 1$, that will probably amplify its network effect long term since a lot of people could get in on the cheap and hopefully bought up a lot
yeah thats a good point
