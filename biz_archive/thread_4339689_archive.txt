Shift will release new website before Q1 2018.
Hop in while it's still at 16k sat.... for a project as big as this with only 11 mil coins this price is very very cheap.

I am still accumulating and my last fiat deposit hasn't gone through yet....
>he bought SHIFT>he didnt buy SUBjesus anon
SUB is miles behind SHIFT and double Market Cap --> no thanks
I was in shift.
Team is shady as fuck.
They added millions of new coins for themselves most likely but claimed it was for others who got scammed or some bullshit excuse
miles behindSHIFT doesn't even have mySQL yet and has been around for YEARS.SUB's beta will be out NEXT MONTH!
consumer version will be out fucking january.
SUB's team is ridiculously more experienced than the SHIFT team, AND has funding behind it.
SHIFT is so proud of no ICO, but that only means they have less hands on deck working to make a product that has mass adoption by consumers.you SHIFT cucks are delusional.
They totally fucked up the ICO.
They couldn't write a fucking script to send the Tokens to the ICO investors.
You had to send them a private massage on slack to recieve your tokens.... And you wanna tell me that SUB's team is more experienced than the SHIFT team hahaha.
they made one mistake so that automatically invalidates all their curriculum?
the fact that they worked with American Express, hp, Disney, Kodak, Apple and the NBA?
crypto has no space for favoritism, only pragmatism.
you will lose money if you still want to be on SHIFT just because you're already in it.i don't know how heavy your bags are, but you still have time to sell them and get into SUB.
don't take this personally anon, you will just lose money if you do.
