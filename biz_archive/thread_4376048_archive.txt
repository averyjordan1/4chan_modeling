>bitcoin above 7k again>bitcoin cash not going downuh???!?
I feel like something is wrong
Everything is perfectly fine and the way it always goes.
Namely the way that long time BTC holders (who still have their BCH from the fork) win big, once again.
last pump before BTC dies forevercan't wait for the drama and /biz/ memes after this happens
ALL THE WAY UP
just wait until bitcoin hit ath again, then corrects below 5k
Beware the sound of one hand clapping.
Or prepare to have your face ripped off.
When will that ugly bcash chink launch his next attack?
btc never dieswhen will you fuckers learn
You're right.You're just not correctly identifying what BTC is.
