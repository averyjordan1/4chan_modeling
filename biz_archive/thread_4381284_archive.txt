that's so vague
It won't moon until the BTC BCH drama is figured out.
BTC is one of the few collaterals they accept and it would destroy the platform if BTC collapsed and all the loans' collateral was worth 50% of what it used to be.
If BTC rose enough the tokens themselves could still be worth 50% of what they once were relative to BTC even if their dollar valuation is higher than at the time of investment.
The only people trying to time this market are YOLO investors trying to strike the lotto and losing 99% of the time

It lost some steam from the hype, but you can be sure if they deliver on release, it'll moon big time.
You either have to watch the market every day and go with the flows and sell off your stack at the high and rebuy at the dip, or just hold and wait.
Looks like it's on a downward trend until more news comes out.
