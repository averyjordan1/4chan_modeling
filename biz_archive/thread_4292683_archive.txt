Just confirmed 1h ago: Snapchat has integrated $MEME into their code, already on GitHub - I know everyone will go and buy meme now as soon, because snapchat is cool lol
where do I buy some
Snapchat is shit but....what the fuck are they doing integrating "le 4chan coin"?
MEME is one step below Chancoin.
If that's true then I'm really fucking surprised.
I think it's better than Chancoin, none of the dev scammer drama, no bullshit.
Actual anons working on it, plus masternodes
FAKE NEWS
dude check the github, it's even confirmed on twitter !
lol for real?
Meme moon?
buying 1 ticket to the moon please...
wow!
its already rising https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-MEME
What a blatantly obvious shill thread
Yes SC, lib central company is 100% going to post coin associated with far right(pepe)kek
Both are shit and I wouldnt even bother, but honestly chancoin looks more promising, and they actually has done some upgrades.
Still, both terrible.
this is the MEME that was forced to rename from PepeCoin by jews?
Doubt snapchat would be adding that, but I am keeping an eye on the project.
fake
this is the MEME that was forced to rename from PepeCoin by jews????
serious?
to get on Bittrex yeah.
It's PEPE in the github and wallet and cryptopia
Yeah the jews on Bittrex wouldnt have it listed as PEPE i heard because of the ADL had it as a hate symbol so they had to settle as MEME
