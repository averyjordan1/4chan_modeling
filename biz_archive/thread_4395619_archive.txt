This is the future Buy now or regret forever as you slave away over a grill.
so when's REQ gonna be above ICO for more than like 2 hours?
Why isn't link in that picture?
seconded - LINK is without a doubt on par with Ark and REQ
Except LINK promises the moon with only a two person team.
REQ at least has a decent team behind it and a solid doable idea.
Never.
Everyone had a selling upportunity of 2 hours.
Even with Profit.
Now keep bagholding for 2years until the locked tokens from the devs are free and then goodbye REQ
Right.
I don't get the team size fud.Look at most original and wildly successful projects/services - they were all started by individuals/tiny teams which then expanded.Take Facebook for example, Cuckurburg created that on his own - THEN - the team expands, its just how business works.
