Bitcoin core, classic, unlimitedCore and classic are the same, idk about unlimited but it sounds like another UAHF (user activated hard fork)>segwit, segwit2xTech jargon that doesn't improve the coin as much as they say it does>LNAn independent channel that stores sequences of transactions before sending them to the blockchain all at once to save money on transaction fees.
Basically a shitty workaround to bitcoins faults.-16mbBlock size.
Every time a block is mined it gets added to the chain and each block stores transaction data.
More data, more transaction support, and a way bigger blockchain.Good enough?
Thanks /b/ro.
But one more question, the Bitcoin we are using right now, from which faction does it come from?
I'm guessing Core.
And who did Bitcoin Cash, Gold and S2X?
