just some good ol' fashioned chink manipulation.look, LINK ain't for the poorboys who need a moon mission right now.
it's for people who already made a good sum and want to park their funds in a surefire super moon mission in 2018. period.
so if you need your poorbux to double, go buy one of those surefire moon missions like confido.
oh wait, heh.
