,000,000>low market capare you joking?
Please enlighten us you lowlife monkey.
Why is MCO a scam?
They have released their product, it works and they are VISA partners.
Youre among the same retards on /biz/ that called ETH a scam when people like myself shilled it here from $1, $5 and $25: “ETH russian scam”.MCO will be $50 by end of 2018 and probably $15 end of this year.
These idiots love to buy shitcoins and lose money.
They dont recognise rare opportunities like SALT, MCO, NEO and probably RLC.
Have split 10 btc between SALT and NEO, feels good to know we’re gonna make it bruh
muh CEO is a scammerYou literally gave 0 valid reasons as to why is this a scam.
Their product works, they are rolling it out in more regions, and basicly provide a service thats going to be worth billions and billions by 2020.
Sell ico on value of asset contract token burn function> wait until the same day as Visa announcement to remove this leaving the token basically worthless and hope people don't realise
except they didn’t
I don't buy from scamy polaks that have a history of scaming people (Esogo).I rather invest in people that dont hype and pump and dump.
TokenCard for the Win !
