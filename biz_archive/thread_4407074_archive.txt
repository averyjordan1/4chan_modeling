I've cashed out all my worthless ether and bought BTC during the dip at $5500.------------------------------------------------------ I switched my miners to start mining Electroneum (ETN) full time and managed to grab around 500 coins in about 24 hours...Is this just another shitcoin or am I gonna be driving a lambo in like a year?
School me fellow shitcoiners.
Shadilay.
ETN is a joke.They literally just forked XMR, then stole the wallet and miner from SUMO.They've done -nothing- as far as I can tell.
They are technically incompetent and say a lot of red flag things like "we're the most secure ever, literally impossible for anything to go wrong" (then their wallets get hacked).They're basically walking around bragging about having a big dick but they actually have a micropenis.
I did notice that when I went to their site yesterday they had a notice up saying they had been hacked...lol........Oh well,ill grab a couple more thousand to HODL and then go back to mining ether and trading it for BTC....fudge it.
