I want to buy LINK simply because the memes makes me laugh and if it moons, I want to shitpost from a place of truth.
LOL just bought 100k
Me too, but I have 20k link which I’m starting to think is too much of a bag to hold for meme’s sakeI bought in last week and silent Sergeui is already infuriating me
1 week silence is killing me
I want to buy because it's the most exciting opportunity in crypto this year.
The memes are a nice bonus though.
This settles.
I'm buying LINK.Anyone suggest a good meme level?
I'm going to be honest here.
I am a senior econ major.
For the longest time in my life I have been a very hateful person.
I would spend a lot of time on pol, and develop very negative views on the world.
This negativity lead to severe depression.Whether anyone likes to hear it or not Biz is a happy place I see sincere optimism here.
Everyone is nice and encouraging, and everyone has one goal.
Since I have began visiting biz, my social life has improved and I have been a more positive person.
Regardless if my 5k investment on LINK pays back or not I am proud to be one of you, and grateful I found this board.
Little baby did not get message from new girlfriend and is making a drama.
We're all gonna make it, bruh./pol/ is hateful because it feels hopeless, and needs to take strong moral views in order to get a feeling of significance.
Basically the white male NEET equivalent of SJWs./biz/ on the other hand is optimistic and sees a bright future of making fat stacks through magic internet money.
Way healthier, mentally.
magic internet moneyPlease crypto market don't pop before I make it.
After a thread about Bitcoin on pol the other day.
I can't go back.

Fucking legendary
The memes tho.
Everytime I browse /pol I'm always laughing my ass off
