We all know Ethereum has the most promising tech and most use cases.
The war between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash will be long, and it will still be going even by the time ETH replaces both.
Ethereum is spawning the future tech economy literally worth trillions.
ETH to 1000$ baby aye!
Okay Just bought 20 ETH
I've been sitting with the majority of my portfolio in ETH for the past 2 months.
It's nice to finally see some market movement.
But I'm half expecting for it to go back to $300 for another month because people are impatient and will start cashing out at the first sign of life.
While this is true, expect to see the measly 5% gain today evaporate the moment BCH and BTC start moving again.It's not time yet.
