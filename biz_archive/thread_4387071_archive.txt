/biz/men if you had the money would you still rent or would you buy?
I feel like renting forever is the best option since you can move to a new place every few years instead of being trapped in 1 place that will be outdated in half a decade
Thats not a human
But->live in it for x amount of time->sell at the same price or higher->repeatYou have to be stupid to rent for 20+ years and still not be landlord
