Isn't it pretty easy to make money from the lack of hashpower for BTC right now?Because transactions are so expensive now, BTC prices are very inconsistent between exchanges.
For example at my exchange bitcoin.de it's currently at 4759€, while at coinbase it sells for 5236€ while the suggested transaction fee is 7.5€How is this not free money?
Or would the transaction just not get confirmed for days?
Also, does Coinbase hold your new BTC for a while or can you sell them immediately once you send them there?
Almost 160k unconfirmed txs hahaha, good luck with that anonhttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions
have enough money to do this (i.e.
don't be me)>Buy 5 BTC on coinbase.de>Set retarded tx fee, 100€ or something>Sell at coinbase for 500-800€ more per BTC
Still will take 3 hours or so.
Exchanges need 6 confirmations.
Blocks are only generated at one third of the normal speed at the moment.A lot can happen in 3 hours.
You might think it's a clever move, but your fees are received in Bitcoin as well.
Have fun waiting days to redeem its value.
you retard, it will take you 3 days to move you corecucks from one exchange to another
Bitcoin is a digital store of value, digital gold.In fact, it is even better than all the other cryptos and precious metals combined.
