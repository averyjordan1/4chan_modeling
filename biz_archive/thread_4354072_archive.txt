BCH will moon to 0.3-0.4 and will get dumped again.soon after it will moon to 1.12 then the flippening will happen, you've been warned.
source?
his dad works for Roger Ver
I'm in a private whale group that plans to moon shot bch and turn it into a coin bigger than btc could ever possibly dream of.
This is happening.
every post with "you've been warned" I've ever seen on here is just bullshit.
he has no source he's just shitposting on biz, bch still is growing but just make sure you swap between the dips
yes, buy more bch cause of the flippening that will happen very soon.
it will begin soon
im down for this but can you provide sources
The source is a BCH ATH bag holder from Saturday.
Fuck off faggot.
Not buying your shitcoin heavy bags.
Buy BTC if you wanna live.
i cant unfortunately, theres some big players in the group that do not want to be revealed.
But dont say i didn't warn you when the flippening happens.
BTC will be $10,000 by December
bro i been waiting for the flippening thats why i started buying at $500 when I saw the huge volume spikes.
Sadly I believed in it so much I didn't sell at above 2k.
Still made good profit selling at 1300 but fuck couldve doubled that and bought back in again.
BCH will be 10k, BTC will be back to 8 cents by December
I've just been buying and selling my 30k stack as the price goes over and under the macd.
Trying to get a few more BCH.
If it does end up becoming the new BTC and is the 100k we were all promised that shit could add up in the long run
What's your motive?
Money obviously you retard
If youre speaking the truth and not shitposting, what is the fundamental reason you believe the flippening will occur?
if you morons had half a brain you would be buying ETC and watching that shit climb slowly and surely
yes sir pls buy my coin thank you very much, very profit and very sex
