After getting rekt by BCH I decided to put what I had left on ethereum classic and link.Will I ever recover?
?
Sorry mate, I think the ETC pump is over.Altough the ETC conference is still going, these "conference pumps" usually hit their maximum just 1 or 2 days before the actual event.The same happened to dash in september, and XRP in october.You either have to wait for the next pump, which might be months away, or cut your losses right now.
I'm not trying to catch pumps right now.
I'm ok holding etc til EOY.
Hopefully it can hit 20 usd again.
