Did we all forget about Confido?
at .90is cents, this coin is still cheap for the low market cap and coin supply.
They have a lot coming up in the near future and are going to be listed on binanace or bittrex any day now.
Confido* damnit.... anyway, would love to hear what you all think of this project
I can't believe you're doing pyramid selling
Got myself some bags, the lack of action is quite suspicious though, I just hope it wasn't a PnD scheme
I picked up 1k since it looks like a solid project with a real world use and with the low market cap this one is going to fly for sure.
I'm looking to get some gains out around $5
This is going to be huge I'm hype accum now under a dollar
 buying something that went 15 fucking x in the past couple of weeksNever go full retard, /biz/.
looking at multipliers instead of marketcap>reddit spacingI find it funny that everyone is looking for the "next Confido" Confido is the next Confido.
