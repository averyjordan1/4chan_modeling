mfw I looking into decred on reddit and see the developer is supporting ASIC mining and not asic resistance due to "botnets" and saying that mining will always will be centralized.
This ruined the image of decred for me.
They're producing ASIC miners for it and the developer has said its made in mind for ASIC mining so its will be controled by people who own loads of them.
What a dissapointment, there's many articles that say decred was supposed to be bitcoin but decentralised and seeing the developer say that they want ASIC miners for centralization just ruins the point of Decred existing.
Thinking of selling my Decred for profits.
I was very pro Decred.
Was going to buy before the Lightning network release, but ya not anymore
miners are the enemyfuck you retards holy shit
Bcash fag detected.
No point in mining if it's centralized.
