Don't miss the boat faggets
This one is gonna be good.
Teeka sendin us some love.Tiny MCThis is where you should put your money if you missed out on POWR
which coin is this?
District0x, don't forget to thank me later.
is this reoated to 0x project
DNTGet in, brother.
We're going to mars with this one/
CFD, thank me later
No.
But the District0x team has stated they may use the 0x protocol in future districts (ETHLance may be the first to get it integrated)
Also, green ID + been holding these bags since a week after ICO because I fucked up and didn't sell in august = moon mission confirmed
why would it be mooning btw?
This is actually the PBC pick.
Take it or leave it.
is it another stupid shill?
graph looks good tho.
Palm Beach rumors, that's enough for a pump.
And if it's true get ready to moon big time.
when will it be certain?
is there any evidence?
bout 7 hours until it's official.
By then Teeka's army of baby boomers will have pushed it into orbit.Everyone thinking it's going to be one of these green energy coins is deluded.This coin has solid fundamentals and technicals, AND fits the PBC criteria.
At least 500% pump to equal ATH, looks like a good pick.
fuck me, i bought at 2 cents in august, didn't sell for 15x, i will probably die with these bags
That would be awesome.
