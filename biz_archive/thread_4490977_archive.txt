Fair warning /bizI've lost money for 2 months now.
I truly suck at this and feel like I'm cursed.
Everytime I buy low it keeps going lower.
Therefore, I am going to buy the next btc dip to try and ride out the train to wealth or it could go to the depths of hell as with my current bags.
You have been warned.
