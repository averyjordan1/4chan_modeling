Agrello just released the first sneak peak video of its digital identity app with Veriff face recognition software , a first step for digital signatures and legally binding smart contracts.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxWadyLfVQc&feature=youtu.be
What a fuggin sweet app.
One of the first of its kind for crypto icos I believe
Nowadays it takes days for ICOs to do KYC verification manually.
This smart verification solution will automate it all.
a must for legally binding digital signatures.
Cant believe its so undervalued, those getting in will be making it big.
Definitely a long term hold.
Damn!
this will greatly increase the speed of KYC verifications!!!
Just researched agrello,,wow,,so undervauled,,,so much potential
Awesome!
Just bought some ;)
This is nice ... Once done, can the KYC be transferable to other ICOs?
