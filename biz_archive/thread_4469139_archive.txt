Dovu has an announcement coming out tomorrow.
Seems to be pumping on ED.
What are you thoughts on this coin?
Announcement is legal problems
what did he mean by this?
kek
Rumor is that they have some legal issues that's causing them to stop all development and cease all communication.
I think this is the coin, but I'm not confido
I would say you are going to get dumped on when the news doesn't turn out to be amazing
Well shit.
hitting binance , token burn next week.
so obvious pump
Thankfully not Confido
Ha, imagine if Confido actually did this.>"BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TOMORROW">One last big pump, even more people jumping on board>"Announcement is that we're abandoning the project.
What?
I said it would be a big announcement"
This was hinted yes.
They have so much funding, access to the big boy exchanges is a given.
