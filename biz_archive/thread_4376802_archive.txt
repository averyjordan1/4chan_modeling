CEO said they will announce the exchanges by the end of the week.
It's already Wednesday evening in Australia...
currently 1 am thursday here m8
What are we waiting from this?
2x?
3x?
I looked into this project yesterday and actually looks decent.
You reckon it's possible to 2-3x from here with some good exchanges?
Absolutely, this project is better than Power Ledger and look at that market cap..Not only can I see a 2-3x, I also think it won't go lower than it is now because it is backed by fundamentals.
Bought in yesterday and dipped further, not scared.
3 fucking exchanges, 2 of which get listed this week (confirmed by CEO) and not to mention "big clients" lined up for end of month.
It may be way up from ICO but it is still undervalued at 7-8mil MC
Easiest moon mission of this month
any chance it will pass 2$ threshold
I'd be surprised if it won't
Please be BinancePlease be Binance

Said by the end of the week?
source?
Not only can I see a 2-3x, I also think it won't go lower than it is now because it is backed by fundamentals.Yup I love projects like this because even if you're only in it for (hopefully) a quick 2x or 3x profit the fact it's not a total shitcoin makes it easy to hold and be patient for a time if necessary.
devs said it wasn't Binance.
There's a screenshot somewhere out there
Didn't they actually confirm they have agreement in place but can't give dates yet?
4378098Nah shit ignore me I'm being bigger tard than usual thinking of another crypto there sorry.
just got back off my ear on the grapevinesone of the exchanges is bitfinex, can't disclose more in fear of my identity
Thank god.
Next to Bittrex and Binance, Bitfinex is the next best thing.
Lots of volume.
Remember those insane ETP pumps?
Remember those insane ETP pumps?That's a comfy memory - biggest gains I've got so far were from ETP.
