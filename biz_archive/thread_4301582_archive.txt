A friend of mine says he's flabberquested about their concept, already sucking in some of his friends and even his parents.
Took me about 15 seconds to find out it's literally a ponzi scheme.
Also; no whitepaper, team unknown and it's all about getting rich fast and easy.They'll be having a presentation tomorrow, where potential new affiliates will be added to their scam.
Now I was thinking of going over their and ask them some difficult questions.
Basically to make them look like fools, also to keep some naive boys and gals from trusting their friends and investing their hard earned money.- The coin is not publicly tradable, only if you become member of their club.
Although my mate says they will be tradable on bittrex 'or something' (lol).- All coins are premined, they exist mostly in the accounts of the unknown admins- Their only source of income is that of (new) affiliates, with which older affiliates are payed calling it 'ROI'.
All payments, ofcourse, are in FRST.- As far as I understand it, your payment will be locked for six months.
Although there is an, probably fas less attractive, option where you can withdraw any time you like.Now what would you say / ask / do to these people?
