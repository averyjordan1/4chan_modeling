iExec already has inked deals to power the computational needs for Request, Signals, and Flixxo.
Partnerships with really big cos are in the works.
With these deals, they are on track to fulfilling their promise to be the cloud computing platform of choice for the dapp ecosystem.
Blockchain-based cloud computing is happening and Iexec is leading the way.
Buy now or be sorry.
Meh
bought few weeks ago, i'm really looking forward the dapp store launch
Iâ€™m holding strong but it hurts to see so many scammy projects ahead of us in the top 100
euro's are terrible at marketing (lying)you need the (((americans))) and chinks for that
Good thing they have a chink faction that is moving forward now.
I just bought in before the price gets too high this could be HUGE.
