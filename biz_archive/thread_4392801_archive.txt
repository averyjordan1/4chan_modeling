Hey, I need help to background check certain investment fund focused on real estate, I have received job offer.
I isn't any usual scam such as they request some money from me.
Job requires once a month travel with travel expenses refunded.
I had been on first meeting.
Met the people, they seem nice and professional but paranoia is awaken.
Mostly because it is really hard to trace anything about them on the internet.
Can someone help?
