What are some ways people here save money so that they have more investment capital for their crypto?I have cultivated a yeast infection on my tongue - so when I want to get drunk I just put a small teaspoon of sugar on my tongue and wait for my yeast kingdom to convert it all to alcohol and then drink it.
It has saved me a lot of money on booze.
this is the dumbest fucking thing i've ever read on /biz, probably 4chan itself
you're dumb for not being a penny pincher considering that LINK is worth pennies now but dolla dolla bills yo in the cumming yearsI've lived with my parents while doing my school and saving my stipend almost entirely for investments.
Also, get your girl to pay for the contraceptives
cool story faggot, this has nothing to do with OP...and I have a bunch of link already, so you randomly shilling it to me is a TOP KEK
