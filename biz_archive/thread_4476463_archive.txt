Considering cashing out, quite nervous about this shit-storm brewing... anyone else share my concerns?
no, i don't fall for the fud flavor of the week.
nervous too but definitely don't want to cash out, not like we can go to tether either though.
eth may be okay, considering that.
hope to god its something, currently waiting for a nice overall market dip
some of the evidence is pretty alarming though
It's definitely an issue.But it could end up resolving itself.Cashing out now is also risking to miss an eventual alt craze.
