Anon-kun... Don't cry.
I don't want to see your sad face.
It's time for me to go.
I know we had some good times and some bad times, but being together with you always made me happy.
Please, move on and find joy.
You're still so young.
There is so much hope and happiness awaiting you.
Goodbye, Anon-kun...
I always loved you.
W-why is this post unironically making me sad????
This is like the 5th time bitcoin has "died".
nvm, I'm back lol
