>bitcoin is a store of valu-If you went into gold in 1980 rather than fiat backed stocks you'd be POORER nowThe same is why Bitcoin is doomed, if gold can't beat the fiat-backed stock market crypto never will
stay poor pajeet
up 400%>"poorer"yeah, nah
So in the mind of normies, Bitcoins are going to become more valuable than gold?That's the only way crypto can win long term and that won't happen
errrrrIf Bitcoin had the same amount of money in it as gold, each Bitcoin would be worth $333,000.Eat shit.
won't happenPlenty of faggots said $100 BTC wouldn't happenPlenty of faggots said $1000 BTC wouldn't happenPlenty of faggots said $10000 BTC wont happenGuess what.
You're just another faggot.
Eat shit.
How is that poorer?
Have you even looked at the chart you've posted?
salty no-coiner.
Fiat+ fungible- inflationary, poor store of value- inherently worthless, controlled, backed by a promise only until it goes to shit> gold+ arguably not a inherently worthless store of value (yet to be convinced as uses tend to be based on assumption of worth minus some niche tech)- not fungible> bitcoin + fungible as fuck+ no one can directly control it+ deflationary- could argue it's inherently worthless but the technology it's built upon does have merit, first time we can send something we ascribe meaningful value to down a communication channel.
It's honest.
No cunt can freeze my buttcoins.
- poor store of value right now, you're equally as likely to come back to 100x as much or 100x less.
This will change as adoption increases.
Well I can see a reason why bitcoin might be worthwhile.
