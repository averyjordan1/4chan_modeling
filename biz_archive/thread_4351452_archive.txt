Am I the only retard that bought in on this?
I just traded my spare Minereum on the first day of the ico for a decent return, if it gets anywhere near Minereums ATH i'll be pretty happy.
You're not alone brother, I chucked $450 on without knowing it'd take 60 YEARS before we get all our Artemine kek.
At the very least, at the current price on Livecoin/Etherdelta it'll only take until about March~April before we pretty much get our inital value back.
Then we can hold the rest when we're old men who made it.
ahahahaahahahahahahahaAHAAHAHAHAHAAHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
