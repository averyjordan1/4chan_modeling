SAID METAVERSE WOULD MOON, IT DIDNT MOON
It wont moon till its added to bittrex or binance...even then china fud is still present.
it has $100 million marketcap compared to qtums 800 million.
thats a x8 man
it will moon hard eventually, prob just not today
Any reason why binance haven't listed them yet?
Binance seem very quick to list chinese projects and its not like ETP team can't afford the fee.
diff blockchain not just an erc20, they are hinting heavily that it's going to happen
when is that going to fucking happen
AHHHHHH
What channels do they use to communicate?
Telegram or slack?
binance is fucking dog shit.
anyone who wants to buy etp can just use bitfinex, including chinks.
why do you think there are chinks waiting for it to get on binance to buy?
bittrex is a different story.
It's ridiculous I know but, look at the BTC and ETH trading pair volumes for ETP on BFX.
Most people think of BFX only as USD trading pairs so they don't bother.
Binance would increase the volume by more than 2 mil per day than what it is now
bitfinex is the market maker for etp, just like it is for iota.
i don't think listing on binance will do anything for its price.
