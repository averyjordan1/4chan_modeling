Did anyone have to wait more than 10 days for fucking bittrex to verify my documents?
The website says that the personal details I've entered don't match my passport's.. but they I am sure they do.
Can you guys help me?
I can't withdraw my funds without being verified :( wrote them.an email too, no response
I was verified same day.
Try trolling them with a retarded photo of yourself.
It took them probably 10 days to verify me.
They didnt even respond to my email for 5 days or so.
Theyre slower in the begging of the week as well
Same thing, the automatic process didnt work so they forwarded it to the department which deals with manual verification.
Took a bit longer than a week.
