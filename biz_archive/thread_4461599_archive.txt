People who want to see more quality content want Chancoin tipping to become a norm here.
Not only it can act as anonymous ID to see who speaks more truth, but it can also earn you a living.
Chancoin will encourage people to post lenghtier, more objective, helpful, experienceful, thoughtful content because you can get tipped.
I have tipped great content creatorsnwith Chancoin wallet addresses in their "name" field who post in different threads.
Maybe you see it as a treat because you like to play in the poo.
I am sure you are Andy who is madnfor being kicked out of the project for you had scammy intentions.>#4CHNallday

The coin is a few months old and has probably made more services and features than 80% of the coin projects you have invested in.
Chancoin is soon going from 0.08 to 0.15 version with the new Cloverhash algorithm.
Join thr Discord and literate yourself with the latest works.You must be a homo for saving man's pictures on your computer.
But I must admit, that beard is outstanding.#4CHNallday

I posted twice in some previous threads and started getting regular tips, I have like 14 chn right now kek.
Is that normal?I'm on the discord but I never posted any addresses there so it can't be random tipping, unless someone went through the threads on an archive to repeatedly tip

Honestly, this could be the most pajeetie coin ever.
If it gets adopted by the chinks over at 2ch, the ruskies over at their chan or the other spergs over in 8ch,... That would give thid coin some legit value.
Which is more than what 99% of alt coins can claim.So, basically, get it while its cheap, fags.
I want moreeee
