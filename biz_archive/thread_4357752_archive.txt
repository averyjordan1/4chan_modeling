I really need help with this one.
I have been looking quite a while now for accurate option chain data when it comes to *Volume(yesterday)* and ~Open Interest~Scottrade is my measurement for correct Open Interest data but this website has no *Volume(yesterday)*It seems that Yahoo Finance and Marketwatch are not trustworthy especially on mondays!!!!
*Volume(yesterday)* gets changed a lot throughout the day while the NYSE has been open for hours.
(It should give the correct data at least 1.5 hours before NYSE opens like it does any other day)Do you guys know why the data on mondays suck?
Why is it always so late and unreliable?Do you have any alternative for accurate data?
I donÂ´t mind paying a few bucks for it if necessary.Pls help :(and thank you for every answer in advance
bump for interest.
havent seen anyone on biz talk about options in a long time
