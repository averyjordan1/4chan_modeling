In prison for CP by the end of the year
eth is useful, but it seems like ultimately it will be free

ETH $40 Q3 2018 screenshot this
maybe his butt itches
I can only imagine the CP he's got tucked away on his laptop...
I honestly wouldn't be surprised; that shit he was rambling about was extremely suspect
the dude only said that he could argue the other side for simple CP possession legality, just as he could argue heroin usage legality.
Again, he just could argue it.
He does not support either.
But he knowns and understand the positions of the opposing side and could argue it.
He made that clear, at least with CP.This is what makes a person a good debater- knowing the opponent's side.If I'm wrong, please tell me how.
I am genuinely interested.
The flippening will happen within 3 years and he'll enter the Gates/Jobs/Musk/Zuckerberg tier of tech figures.
Just watch
I'll just leave this here.
the nigga fucks kids its pretty obvious
get a hold of that creep's hard drive I guarantee it's loaded with CP moron
LMAO is this a shop?
I can't believe it

 year.Crypto is going to explode over 2018 because it will actually be used for IRL stuff en-masse then for the first time for non-monetary things.
