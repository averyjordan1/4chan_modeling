You emotional cucks don't even realise that BTC needs this correction to hit 10k
I'm not sure it can recover from this.
How's it gonna hit 10k if it ceases to exist?
go back to /r/bitcoin with that shitthis isn't a correction
Bitcoin corrected from $5k to $3k (40% loss) 2 months ago.
So this dip is nothing in comparison.
It sucks that there isn't a quick way to buy BTC or any crypto in the USAso most of us miss out as usual
Yeah..
The reason BTC did that before was because the money was stolen, at GOX.
The people had no choice.
In this.. people are actively trading their BTC for BCH.Not so sure BTC will recover.
And if it does, I doubt it will cause BCH to go back to what it was a few days ago.
fr man idk what is wrong with these people if anyone thinks Bitcoin is going to beat Bitcoin Cash when Bitcoin has all its problems think again.
Just wait till those unconfirmed transactions get filled lets see what they buy...

Seriously why would you buy alts right now?Lets say you have 250 bucks of bitcoin you bought at 7k, now that bitcoin is 5.5k it is worth 200 bucks and any alts u buy will be with 200 bucks not 250 so you not only get less as alts havent dropped in SATS only in dollar value because bitcoin has dropped.Example: You spend 250 on bitcoin at 7k+Now your bitcoin worth in dollars is 200~If you put in that bitcoin into an alt and it goes up 25% you made 50 bucks on your 200 and now you have gone even stupid fuck
