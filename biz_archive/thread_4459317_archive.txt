I have been shilling POWR for many days now due to the fact that it's a beautifully executed concept with real use case and backing.
However, do not let yourself get destroyed at 5pm EST when Chicken Teeka picks SLR.
It will without a doubt divert a lot of people in POWR right into SLR for a ridiculous pump.
Get in SLR now and sell the pump for more POWR after tomorrow.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
It's not hard to piece the SLR pick together.
Just asking, what quality of pump does this pajeet usually provide?
100%?
Less?
More?
-3x or more.
Obviously there's no guaranteed amount but take a look and ZenCash for an example
Giggity
I will not be able to watch the pump live.
What do you suggest as a sell price to take the most profit without risking being dumped on?
,000 sats.
I recko well see probably 15k on powr in next couple hours then im getting out for SLR
Just threw 1btc in SLR.
Fuckin sick of missing these pumps.
Praying for a 2-3x
Just use a good stop and make sure it's set before the PBC announcement
Yeah just set a stop at 7k, excited!
