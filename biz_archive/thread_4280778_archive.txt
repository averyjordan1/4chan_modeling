Don't fall for shills.Buncha bagholders are fearmongering and shilling BCH right now.
BCH is a good coin and has advantages over BTC but its not replacing BTC overnight.
Not saying BTC will win this fight.
I'm saying there is no fight.
Shills make it seem like there is to pump and dump on the daily.Be careful of what you read here.
Most of it is just manipulation for personal profit.
