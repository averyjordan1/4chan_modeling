Metaverse ETP is THE coin to buy now that segwit2x is postponed indefinitely.
Why?> Listing on EXX.com coming soon (china exchange with high volume which is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to get listed on)> Just announced partnership yesterday with Aion on cross-chain digital assets and oracles.
Many people still have no idea about this yet and this is HUGE> Bitfinex barring US citizens from trading on 9 Nov. Today is 9 Nov. Price is still going up.
Which means those who want to play safe have ALREADY sold.
If they want to buy back in, they have the option to use hitbtc which just recently listed ETP on Nov 3> Market cap.
The market cap was just updated 2-3 days ago on coinmarketcap.com, with a huge jump of approximately 40% in the circulating supply.
However, there was no dump.
Why?
That's because the remaining investors are genuine and believe in the project because it is fundamentally sound.> CEO Eric Gu.
He is a man of connections and business vision.
Check out his interview in the link below and see for yourself how ETP differentiates itself from its competition.Get in now.

Can I use Bitfinex still?
I am in US and is still 11-8
https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/227Are you a US citizen or are you just passing by the US?
I am not exactly sure but if you are just passing by you should still be able to trade on bitfinex without any issues.
However, if you are a US citizen, I would not recommend you taking the risk, and you should instead look to withdraw your holdings from the exchange into other accounts.
