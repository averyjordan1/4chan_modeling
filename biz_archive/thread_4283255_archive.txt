I know right!Look what /biz/ did to Espers!
Constant FUD 24/7, it sure help Espers now!!!
*sarcasm*By the way, what Espers offer and ODN offer is exactly the same, messaging on the chain.Coincidence?
By the way, what Espers offer and ODN offer is exactly the same, messaging on the chain.you have no idea what ODN offers.
I know exactly.
A fucking vaporware no one will use.
messaging on the chain.uh oh, someone is misinformed here.
Messaging on the chain would make it a email-system that is too slow.
Gotta get a mix between on and off chain, like Obsidian.
Did i forget to mention ODN is a platform?
You guys can go to hell.
ODN is one of the most transparent projects out there.
Any questions you might have will be answered straight away on the slack.
Please KYS
Nice FUD gayboi
Isnt that the scammer from tak coin or whatever?
Haha

Haha it is!
Reverse google image searched and his name SageFit came up.
I remember that dude from back in the day, huge scammer.
He didnt even bother changing his aelias and goes by sagemark now.
If you bought odn you deserve to get scammed
i bought odn at ico, sold some at 20k for comfy 10x gains, and saved some for long term, but still up 2xi sure feel scammed desu
Who is this guy and why does he have such a bad reputation?
