We've missed you.
It's very comfy in here.
Bought 400 more at 92k sats.
Timing was good enough.
HAHAHAI TOLD U FAGGOTS TO ACCUMULATE
I should've bought more yesterday.
But it's the most I have of any alt coin anyway so I'm fine with it.
I'm just glad it's back.
Nothing can stop us OmiseGoys now
it truly is impressive how low IQ some people are...I mean if you're new to the game then it's understandable that you don't know exactly what to do, but if you're in this shit for a long time then holy fuck...it was so fucking obvious that this coin was undervalued and it still is...
no working product>no use case>philosophical idea board instead of roadmapkys
FML I panic sold all my BTC for OMG and now its coming back down.
Fuck you Jun and Segwit brokeback mountain fuck buddies fuckers

The pump has just begun

Price predictions for the next few days?
The bear market disillusionized me.
Jun is really a faggot and OmiseGo is dumb as shit
