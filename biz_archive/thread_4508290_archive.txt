Quantum resistant blockchains are the new rave.
Crypto investments always flock to new technological advances.
It's a fact that's permeated since 2014.
From Bitcoin to Ethereum to Monero to now QRL.
Enjoy the ride folks.
What is the big deal?
I also think quantum will be the next big step - good investment

Seems like quite a lot for a fad... would give a marketcap of over 2.3 billion, not saying its impossible but it doesn't seem likely..

Very simple.
QRL is a meme.

It actually brings something useful to the table and has great potential
