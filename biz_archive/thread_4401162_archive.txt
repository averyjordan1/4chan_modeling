Not sure either, we need some kind of chart.
But I believe there was no correlation between BTC and XMR
He's saying that you aren't going to lambo land, you're just going to have to settle for a Mustang

Prob yea.
But if you keep at it in 10 years you will prob have 500K to 1M if you keep spreading your money.
