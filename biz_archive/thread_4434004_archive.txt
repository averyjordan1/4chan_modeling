I'm holding mostly BCH and other coins, but also some NEOI'm like a Chinese person haha, feels so comfyThis dump is temporary, lol.
It drops like $4 after going up $20 and these noobs scream like shit.
Same thing happened with BCH, it went up more than 200% and then went down, and then they lost their shit.
This is why weak hands lose, long holders win.Buy and hold noobs.
