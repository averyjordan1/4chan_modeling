I got a letter from the SEC saying that I'm being investigated for giving out financial advice on /biz/ and other websites without being a "Registered Investment Advisor".
Do I need a lawyer?
The jews are going to come to my house, arent they?
You need a revolution.

Its a big game of Chess anon, and they've got you in check.
Your only move is renting a ryder truck.God speed.

come on OP if you're gonna LARP you could at least forge a fake letter or even email

Have proofs?
If OP is not lying then the gov would need to know his IP somehow and match it to this Taiwanese cartoon board's logs.
Don't they need a warrant to get logs from your ISP and 4chan?
I would only imagine this to be worth bothering with if you're a terrorist or something.
