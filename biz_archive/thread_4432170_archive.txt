What's the fucking point???
how so?
Not sure.
I got phished yesterday, which I wasn't too worried about because I have 2fa activated.
Then I wasn't able to log in because 2fa stopped working.
Looks like this has happened before and the concensus I have seen if that 2fa on polo is insecure.
I froze my account and am waiting on an email from support....
>using poloniexwell, that's your problem
I've never had 2fa on polo and i've never been hacked because I know how to type poloniex.com into my browser bar and I don't click unsolicited emails that involve me typing anything in.
That's nice you know how to type an address in.
Shit happens, and the shit that happens is why 2fa exists.
