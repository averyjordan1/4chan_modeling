The trading history shows that one person bought 297,000 POSW, which is equal to to 7 BTC.
This isn't a huge buy, but 7 BTC is twice the current daily volume from all other trades combined.There's something going on here.
Somebody knows something.
so people at POSW .... don't buy back their own product ?
