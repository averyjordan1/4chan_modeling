Can we get a good old fashioned regret/JUST thread going?
A little context helps.Did no research going in and thought WTC was just another Chinese scamcoin like Healthcare Chain or those other early Binance chink scams they disabled trading for.
I got out ASAP with a 0.25 BTC profit.
The next 2 months I would furiously avoid/hide/ignore all Walton threads as it mooned to $9
I need to find the place we are going to meet and if I can't then I am sorry is it in town I don't have a vehicle or any thing
Bought astro at 3$...LINKED
Got JOOST'D out of 10 ETH by confido
sold ant shares after it tripled with my like 100 dollar investment
Don't worry anon.
A few months from now there will be another one of these threads and someone will post "sold astro at $10"
i'd like to never have made that all-in 500 BTC bet on a dice site in 2014
Sold 11k ANS at $8
Just started trading this summer so I guess I’m a summer fag.
But I needed my hand held.
My buddy was the one holding my hand.
Had me start investing in ETH and taught me to day trade up and down, selling every time I went up $25 bucks, rinse and repeating on gdax.
Made a couple hundred, got hooked.
Started browsing coinmarketcap and researching cheap coins.
Find Antshares.
It’s $3.
Show buddy, tell him I’m thinking about Buying in for $1000.
Tells me to wait, it just had a big run up he said, it’ll correct he said.
Eventually buy in at $16.
He eventually buys in with $25K at $24.
Blames me for not telling him it makes GAS/Pays dividends
Sold all my BTCRED 4 days ago.
FML.
Turned 1 btc to 0.3 in one minute with potcoin.
I deserved it.
