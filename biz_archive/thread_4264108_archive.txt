>tfw having 10k on Kraken and couldn't invest when segshit2x was canceled>only have 50% in alts when they finally recoveredKraken: not even once.
Don't be me and do yourself the favor, just stay away from this shit tier exchange.
There is literally no worse exchange.
It has cost me thousands.
>trades on kraken
newfag here.
what do you guys recommend as btc exchange site?
I'd don't trade there.
I just tried to have it ready after transfering money from my bank account there in order to buy ETH at 290, which I tried about 50 times and couldn't finish the order.
Are there any other exchanges that allow you to withdraw in euros?
I don't know honestly, but that is the reason why I used Kraken so far in order to convert FIAT into cryptos.
Same.
But these constantly failed orders start to get on my nerves as well.
Alternative exchanges for eurofags?
I have been having the same problem for at least two month.... Something's shady is happening there.
Went for bitmex/Bitrex but I like the euro/crypto pair on kraken :(
