This feels like the election all over again.
I'm telling you guys BTC will not prevail this time the market is hungry for a new king coin.
While I don't think POW coins are the future BCH is gonna be your worst nightmare very soon.
more like floyd mayweather vs. connor mcgregor.
There will be no new king.
connorWhy do you normies talk about him so much when you can't even spell his name correctly?
this is the real world.
McGregor would kill Mayweather in a real fight.
Like BCH is gonna suck BTC through its anus.
plebbit you have to go back
Is that from today OP?
Or we helping those wounded bag holders left behind?
worst nightmare because it's a huge piece of shit and people are stuck holdings it shit filled bags?i am one of them.fuck BCH.
Did you see the buy wall that pops up from time to time?
I wonder if they are planning a coordinated buyout of all BCH at some point and drive BCH to 1:1 with BTC.
