Can someone explain to me how B2X is "free money"?
?If BTC is $8k before the fork>No one uses B2X, BTC is worth $8k post-fork and B2X is worthlessor>Half the userbse (or any fraction) starts using B2X, both coins will be worth around $4k post forkAm I seeing this wrong or is there no such thing as free money?
Fear of missing out and the full scale cryptocurrency bubble will make the parent and child worth more then the parent, pre-fork.Good luck.
not only not free money but chaos because when you spend on one chain you spend on the other meaning you send people double the coins in a sense.
That's why there's so much hoopla around this hf.
If you think this is the case, you get actual free money if you open a long on Kraken and I think Poloniex as well.
Hmmm.
Then what's stopping me?
Its not free money because there is no replay protection.
People will sell their B2X coins for like 1-2k and then realize their BTC is now gone as well.
If you sell your B2X coins you're literally s retard.
Not that it will matter since BCH will take the throne while Block stream, Core and all the NO2X sock puppets destroy each other through their greed and autism.
full scale cryptocurrency bubbleThis is literally the first time I hear about being in a bubble.Fuck better get out of crypto - THIS TIME IT'S REALLY A BUBBLE.
Only retards can't figure out how to split their coins before sending it to an external address.
