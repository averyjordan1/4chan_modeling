WHY DOES WHENEVER I SELL SOMETHING IT IMMEDIATELY GO UP???
?I HAVE BEING HOLDING THE MOTHER FUCKING SHIT FOR A WHOLE WEEK AND IT NEVER WENT UP ONCE!
Did you just wake up and decide to sell off your crypto without looking at the news ?
Have you not noticed the BTC fluctuation and literally EVERY alt rising right now ?
Why wouldn't monaco do the same, it did.
but btc did not change in price during the last 3 hours.
it is being staying put at ~7.2k for half a day now.
people moved outa btc once they realized they were gettin no segx2 coin
that happened 18 hours ago buddy.
Are you literally a fucking spastic?A week is nothing you dumb cuntI'm happy you lost money
