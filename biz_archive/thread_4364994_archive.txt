StorJ has gone up nearly 25% the last hours, and it seems to keep up.
Not unlikely to reach 20k satoshi the next hours, and if it breaks the next support we will witness a huge growth in the next days.
Im going for it.
I´ll post here when i pick up my new lamborghini
Better sell now.
Selling now means missing thousands of dollars in profit.
Im in with 40k, and i know when to sell
>I´ll post here when i pick up my new lamborghiniThis is how you spot a pajeet, anons.I've just sold all my storj.
This is nothing but a pump and dump.
