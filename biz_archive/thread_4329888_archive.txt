Who here bought BCH above 0.4?
That's some cryptogore there
hows that possible.
It never even went to .4
at about 4AM this morning it did, then there was a hard dump.Anon, I believe there will be a last pump this night, but I doubt it will go up to 0.4, you can HODL that shit and wait for the next pump or you can cut your losses and sell at, 0.32, if it even comes to that.

I've just held mine since the fork.
Mostly due to laziness desu.
