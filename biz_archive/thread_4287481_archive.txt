From megaman x.
You think he's defeated but he just keeps coming back and causing more destruction!X: So it was you after all.
Zero: You never give up, do you?
Even when we break you down to scraps, you always come back.
[slashes his saber as a form of emphasis.]
Sigma: That's right, folks!
I'll do it again, and *again*!
I will make X and Zero *mine*!
Now, come and get me!
Give me a good fight, like you always do!
