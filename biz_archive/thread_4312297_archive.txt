>LTC still holding strong even during this unholy chaosso why the fuck haven't you bought in?
i have.
200 soon.
Sent 180 ltc from bittrex to gdax yesterday.
took a half hour.
this is supposed to be the fastcoin wtf
because if I wanted my value to sit there and do nothing I would give it to mr. goldstein's bankTHANK YOU ROGER YESSSSS
its the exchanges that are slow, not the coins.
BTC would take even longer, regardless.
Are you fucking joking, bitcoin would have taken hours...
I took 1/2 my hodl and put it in LTC when BTC was 7400.
LTC mooned to 63 and I then put 1/2 of that into BCH 3 days ago the view from mars is pretty nice.
You know LTC will be utterly worthless if BCH flippens right?
The real bitcoin will no longer be congested, and LTC loses its only reason to exist.
In @ 36.34 feels gud bro
Why can't litecoin exist without bitcoin core?
I'm many ways it's better than bch and btc.
Why isn't litecoin more popular
VTC gonna be the next LTC, accept it and get in while you can.
