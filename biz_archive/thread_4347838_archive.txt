This board was literally shilling it for 2 weeks, and now it's called Comfydo :(
Because you refuse to buy low.
someone has to buy highdo your part, op
i hate moneyI actually bought 1 ETH of confido the FIRST FUCKING DAY ON EDThen SOLD it for 2 ETH some day laterNow i hate my life..... WHY Did i not let my winners ride ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
goddamn I shoulda bought this shitI think long term its going nowhere unless they can get actual customers using it but I doubt it.
but in the mean time I could have profited nicely selling to the greater fool
Because you can send someone garbage and no when can legally enforce it
Next mooner is HST on etherdelta
Dont be greedy, that's how you lose it and then you'd be bitching about why you didn't sell when you were up.
Take your profit and keep it moving.
This one.
I'm already up but I like this project and was going to dump but I'm a little excited about the upcoming news
yes but selling 1.2 and let .8 ride would never have been a bad thing
