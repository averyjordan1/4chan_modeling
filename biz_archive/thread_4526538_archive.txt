To the people holding Bitcoin Cash right now, I recommend setting a stop loss at 0.18-0.19 BTC.
It's already in the process of forming a double top (meaning that supply is outrunning demand), so if it drops any lower than that, it's done for unless some extra news comes during the next few days.
Do not rely on dragon slayer hype to pump its value this weekend because it's already priced in and most who believe it have already bought in.
Happy thanksgiving anons!
Yeah goyim, sell right before operation dragon slayer beginsSell sell stop earnings NONE
Next time try to put some effort into fitting in because it's obvious that you're really fucking new to this board.
ANYONE who has been trading crypto for more than a year knows that coins never moon after a double top, which is why you should place a stop less order a bit below the resistance just in case one forms.
If that's a double top then I'm Willy FUCKING WonkaTurbo retardation.
