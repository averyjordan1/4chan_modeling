Hello,Currently I have around $1600 to trade crypto with.
I have recently lost some money due to stupid moves but I'll skip the "woe is me" bullshit.
Should I diversify at all at this point?
I'm thinking of just using my whole stack for semi long hold.
I'm not gonna be daytrading though.
If you want to all in and play it safe XMR or ETH are best bets IMO.
Maybe not the most money but I can almost 100% assure you gains over the next few years.But Risk = More Reward my friendPOWR: Not even risky because unlike most of the shitcoins that you will see being shilled here this one has been tested and proven to work and is already in affect and governments have granted it money already and it's just looking fucking nice only like a month or so old.
It's on a climb rn but if it dips under .60 I would just all in your 1.6k for insane gains.IOTA: IOTA is about an 8/10 on risk scale but with the partnerships it has and the good team it has it could do very well.
In fact the tech on this one is so good that if in theory everything they said they would do they do it will UNDOUBTEDLY beat the rest of the cryptos currently on market.Funcoin: Unlike the other coins I have mentioned I don't actually have any FUN coin but that's just because I'm personally waiting for the site to comeout to buy them.
Great idea and this one would be for if you split some money up maybe drop $100 or $200 in here.Don't listen to anyone that tries to pitch to youChainlinkArkLiskBtcRippleZcashYou're welcome, good luck.
