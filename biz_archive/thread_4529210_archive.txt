What happens if the biggest BTC holders get spooked and cash out leaving all us regular people with nothing?
End of crypto?
The biggest BTC holders are loaded whatever happens.
Most of the early holders have no intention of cashing out
Wrong.
That kind of deal wouldn't be done on fucking poloniex, they would sell off market and nothing would happen
I find that hard to believe.
If I was an early holder and I had billions of dollars worth of bitcoin I would've moved all that into real life assets and investments.
I got a feeling they're waiting for it to settle around a highest point and then dump before they think the other massive btc owner does.
What happens if the biggest BTC holdersThese are all insane people who would rather be buried with their bitcoins than sell.
