Daily reminder that the ODN team met on slack, most likely through affiliation of pumping and dumping other coins.
No in house collaboration, no working block explorer, whatever goes on behind the scenes is limited to slack communication and a black box of pumping and dumping.+1 For SageScam openly admitting to pumping and dumping a coin: See related

xtrabytes trading channel was a big contributor, that place breeds these scams.
+2 for blackstone trigger banning people

+3 for the gym opened up by SageScam which is uncreatively named WhiteStone.
Would not be surprised if Blackstone is a fake account.https://sagefit.com/
+4 for SageScam having a track record of scamming people on other projects going back to 2014.
true if big
small if not large
kek why do you so vehemently FUD against a coin with a 6m market cap?
wtf?
If you honestly care this much there may be something here worth researching
The market cap doesn't matter when you are getting played by a jew bastard who will probably abandon the coin before anything is released.
Steals a ton of money
price started creeping back up right before this autiste started posting like 3 ODN FUD threads.
kinda weird timing, imo.
what happened with worldcoin is public knowledge.
it wasn't sage's fault.
you're an idiot who needs a new hobby.
Its more than world coin.
he has been known to be involved with TakCoin, another known scam.
look it up.
Also what the fuck does he do around the community now that there are 4 moderators?
What is a community lead?
He was absent during the investor meetup, he doesn't have any real responsibilities.
I will tell you:He has connections that are whales whom pump coins in the beginning and then sell of.
This guy is a world class, dirty money snake.
