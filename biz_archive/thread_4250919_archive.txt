BTC - Wow, I have to admit...
It should be called the biggest fraud ever.
No hate towards the idea of dezentral money but WTF!!!!
The planned all that and the alt market plumpered like trash and flushed down the toilets.
They killed a lot of poor guys money to make the market value grow big.
It would grow on its own/natural way anyway so why did the have to kill the alt market temporarily for?!
Who ever runs BTC now - I hate you forever!!!
!When is he next fork going to happen?!
Hard forks like this should be forbidden or regulated that their fucking value is like close to zero and that the forked coin has to deliver actual additional usage/innovation before it rises in value...just like every other fucking coin that is out there!!!
kys nocoiner commie boomer fag
Translated that to " I fucking hate myself for not buying BTC when it was cheaper but since I didn't I'll spend the rest of my days being a penis".
Bitcoin shouldnt be controlled by anyone
