What does /biz/ think about auton.io ?It's been on the rise recently and the marketcap is still pretty low.
Good buy or shitcoin?
delete this thread (then go all in)
Wouldn't you want to make threads to promote the coin once you're all in to make it raise?
mfw I got an airdrop of this just by holding MBRS
Same here.
It was 1:10 so not that much though.
Funnily enough MBRS was absolute shitcoin that lost me tons of money but the airdrops from it are almost worth more than the MBRS themselves.
Isn't Cindicator similar?
Feels bad man.
I stocked up on some MBRS bags thinking it will moon with the unveiling of their own blockchain, but guess what, they got hacked 2 days before the day of the unveiling and they still have not resolved it.

Wish I could say the same for me, I bought in a shit time.
Wasn't ATH but was close
You misunderstood.
The airdrops are worth more than the MBRS at the moment.
But MBRS are worth fuck all now so I'm still down by a lot too.
Oh I see what you mean now.
Yeah, I really thought MBRS was undervalued but what do I know.
