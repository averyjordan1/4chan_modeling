literally identical.
AND WEN I PUT TEN THOUSAN DOLLAS ON HERRRRRRRRRRRRR... SHE GONNA SAY WOOOOOOW!!!!
YOYOYOYOYOYOYO OK DAS REEEEL
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

What am I looking at here?
market cap crashed 1.5Billion dollars on coinmarketcap for bitconnect
because bitconnect's coin is basically only on their own exchange (over 95% volume), they can manipulate the price as they see fit.
They were getting way too much attention for being in the top 10 on coinmarketcap, so they just decided to delete 1 billion dollars from their marketcap overnight.
Mmm mm no no no
Neat
MMMHHH-MHHH NONONOOO!!!!!!
Coinmarketcap are the heroes we need
Why do you have to lie?
Bitconnect is in a lot of exchanges, bittrex includedhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnect/#markets
bittrex included>bittrex not listedBITCONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Trust is I got more gains from Bitconnect than any other cryptos combined
BBC Exchange - Volume 95.75%
you could just hold bitcoin though
