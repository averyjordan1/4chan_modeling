How big of a deal is it if the United Nations are a client/partnership?

 how big is the UN
im getting really sick and tired of this shit.
and by this shit, i mean the teasing of announcements that we see all the fucking time in crypto.
its just blatantly done to hype a coin or rise the price temporarily.
its very shadey and dishonest.
seriously , either make the announcement when you have some news or stfu about it.
dont say "HUGE announcement coming on the 22nd ;) " .
then it turns out the huge announcement is you added a new team member.
just fuck off
Not really at all.
The UN has shown itself to be more and more of a circlejerk of bureaucratic nothing in every multi-country conflict since the end of ww2.
