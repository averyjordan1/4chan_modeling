low riskx gainsDoesn't exist, m8.
You got me there.
btc obviously is the lowest risk way to do this, some might not agree but its true, if you really want you can diversify into eth and ltc as well.
everything else is higher risk and possibly higher reward but no garantee for it
If you were a millionaire, you wouldn't ask such a stupid question, anon.
If anyone tells you they have a low risk investment that they know will make you 10x gains, they are selling you on a Ponzi scheme.
Do you not understand how markets work?
If there was somehow a low risk investment with 10x gains, traders would flood it, immediately driving up the price and reducing the gains.
That's why things are generally "high risk, high reward" or "low risk, low reward."
Your best bet is BTC, but even that is no guarantee.
