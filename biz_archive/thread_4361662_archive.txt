When did you realize that crypto is your one and only shot at getting out of the rat race?
Never because it isn't
2013
Everyday this becomes more true.>tfw need 3mil to retire>tfw have 100k>tfw cant tolerate more than 5 more years of wage slavery before i off myselfIm honestly thinking about going all in on crypto, then living as a hiker off the wilderness for a year sleeping nightly in tents and eating berries and shit off the land.I cant do this.
tfw need 3mil to retirewew lad, for me it's $300k at most to live comfily ever after off ARK dividends
black and white thinkinghave a great race!
you need more than thatonce more people get into ARK there will be dilution which will make your payments less
at least you have a shot, be thankful for that.
Half the world is working just to be a part of the Rat Race and only a small percentage are working to be the Fat Cat, we will make it.
Believe, and keep trying, make smart moves, be patient, hold the ICO you have faith in and one will pan out, just one of those ICO's hits $17+ you got your 5,000+ sitting there that's enough to start a comfy real portfolio bro you got this.
Not true.
Number of people doesn't matter, only the number of coins that are voting.
While the number of coins will increase over time, this dilution will be offset by an increase in price, assuming there will indeed be greater demand in the future.
Yesterday at night.
