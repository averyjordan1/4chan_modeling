A lot of us knew about this coin i even invested into it a month ago and pulled out now i hate myself
but but... BCH is up 30%!
This is literally the next MTL, I'm waiting for $5-$10
lol.
Ive seen a few posts on here about it, but no one replies.
bought in at .24 and feeling very comfy through this bch btc bullshit
randomly saw about it this morning, didn't touch it... come home from thanksgiving bullshit... its more than doubled.in a word, fuck.
Friendly advice, buy it now this is the dip phase.
It'll shoot past 65 in the next few hours.
