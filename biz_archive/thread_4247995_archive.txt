Just wondering as a noob why Metaverse is meant to be a good investment?
How much would Metaverse be worth in let's say 3-5 Years?
Should I even long term hold it?Or is it a scam I should avoid it?
Did you even research?Or are you here to be spoonfed because ur a low iq retard?
DOnt buy ETP you dont deserve the gains
Id say its atleast 100$ by Q3 2018.
And being dead serious
confirmed scam
awesome CEO, good team (60+ ppl), great project (id on blockchain).who can tell what the crypto market will look like in 2022?
reminder, btc has grown from 11B to 120B this year...
if you see it posted on /biz/ multiple times a day by the same people (bagholders most likely) it's a strong sign to stay away from this shitcoin
also if you rely on /biz/ for your investment you're doin it wrong
Eric Gu wants actual companies using his blockchain, not random developer kiddo's, that can create any shitty smart contract and fuck up the chain.
Metaverse will first vet and security test smart contracts before allowing it on the blockchain, keeping it clean and lean.
For a lot of companies that want to use blockchain but don't want to do everything themselves this is a great option.
Atleast that's how I understand it.Also they have a very interesting solution for digital identity etc AND they have partnership with Tim Draper, a better investor than anybody here on /biz/
I'ld say anything around 3$'s is cheap, but I need more actual developments to justify a higher price.
Nonetheless, a lot of shitcoins are priced higher than this while being worse, so dunno
Graphs look OK if it breaks out above $3.20
this kinda makes it centralized
yes indeed, but that doesn't matter much for many uses cases.
It doesn't want to be the first global currency.
