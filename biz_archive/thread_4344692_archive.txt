MOD is very closely following the pattern set by WTC.
Also I've noticed these coin trading with a relatively strong correlation.
AI has likely picked up on the similarities between the two tokens and the feedback loop is resulting in a self fulfilling prophecy, a prophecy which could suggest Modum IO is about to moon in a spectacular fashion.
Because that's how crypto works huh...
The market is the only reason MOD should be struggling right now.
Such a solid project in an even better position than WTC was at this point.
Yeah MOD won't use their own Blockchain or have staking, but dividend holding for profit sharing is likely to be way more lucrative to the tokens value anyway.
nice chart vodoo
TFW you are a poorfag with only 1.2k MOD and know you could go to lamboland if you had more money :(
