This is a prime time to strike with that 45k BTC Roger transferred to exchanges.
Opinions, ideas?
Any increase in price will cause more miners to come over.
They wont do it, that transfer to the exchange was merely a bluff
monitor fork.lol, the miners are clearly moving toward BCH after the upgrade.
just be patient, by the end of the week I would be surprised if corecoin was still #1 on coinmarketcap
What was the point of the pump this weekend?
I don't believe it was korean citizens, everyone knows Chinese miners are selling their BTC through Korea.
The dollar amounts were ungodly I don't think citizens even have access to that kind of capital.
I don't believe it was some stupid ass pump and dump, what would the miners and Roger have to gain from that?
They were buying incredible amounts of BCH at high prices.
