>Expects people to sell as soon as they see redNot today my friend
bought at $4, I'm comfy
Get ready for the dump you fags
December 31st I will make sure to make a thread asking if NEO is $100 yet to the NEOmarines
would you believe me if I showed you this graph in January 2014?
yes, because graphs represent numerical patterns.
Therefore they are empirically true
Mate, I wouldnâ€™t believe you if you showed me that graph in June 2017
Oh many I didn't know NEO was actually a coin to be used as a form of currency/store of value.
Thanks man!
this lol and I believe we'll see $100,000 / BTC within five years
WE ARE THE NEOMARINES
