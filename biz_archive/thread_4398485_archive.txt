I have work in 3 hours and I need to sleep.
Currently all in on BTC wanting to buy alts cheap when it stops rising, but I'm afraid alts will rebound by the time I wake up.Should I let my money stay in BTC?
Will it keep going up?
Should I sell for tethers?
Should I just buy into my alts right now?
Help me biz
