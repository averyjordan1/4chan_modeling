A little birdy told me that this is heading to $0.60 - $1.Accumulate while you can.
lol30x - 50xDo you even markek cap, bro?
Nice just bought 100k
I hope someone shows up with the link to the article explaining exactly why it will go 17-51x.
Knew I should have saved it then.
Anyway, moral of the story is get in, or cry later.
Hour actually looks pretty good, seems to be in an accumulation zone, it probably wont 30-50x but its a definite 2x at least.
x is 3 billion.
For a massively disruptive product with an incredible team.
There are true shitcoins with a market cap larger than that.
This.
Jez is gonna take us to the moon.
