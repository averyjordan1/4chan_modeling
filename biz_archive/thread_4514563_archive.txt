Just found new gemsQvolta just $1.3 millions cap.- Legit business, real company registered in singapore.- Product currently in working alpha, estimate full launch before end of year- They are making P2P exchanges but alots of better than localbitcoins.
They will launch Android and IOS apps in Q1 2018- P2P exchange must exist, the best way to cash out BTC -> cashI just join their telegram group a week ago.
They got huge problem with coinmarketcap, which Coinmarketcap did not display their circulating supply and marketcap.
after few weeks unpatient early investor start to dump their token, with FUD towards Dev accusing Dev not actually burns unsold token, the price dump even more.but guess what, Coinmarketcap just show their correct circulating supply and market cap.
And its just $1.3 millions!1st FUD, they claim total token supply are 21 millions not 10 millions because etherscan showing 21 millions token.Dev show they prove they did burns unsold token but the contract in code so average people can't tell how much they burns.but one smart guy actually do research.
he count every token from holders at ethplorer and confirm there are only 10 millions++ token.
which only 6 millions something in circulating.
Dev hold ~30%I did math and he's real.
go count yourselfhttps://ethplorer.io/address/0x1183f92a5624d68e85ffb9170f16bf0443b4c242#pageSize=100&tab=tab-holdersJust a day after that they submit the prove and being verified by Coinmarketcap team.
and Yesterday they update correct information on CMC.its f****ing $1.3 millions.

You're going to have to hire a native English speaker to write your shill posts if you expect me to buy your product.
