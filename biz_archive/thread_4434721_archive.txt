Buy the dip todaySell during aggressive pump tomorrowBuy the gigantic 35% dip after the conferenceSell the aggressive pump when bithumb adds it.
Why do you expect a dip after the conference?What if the announcement is actually good?So far it seems like it's gonna be good:https://www.twitter.com/kucoincom/status/931922594080595968
Is accumulating via margin trading a usable strategy?
Well it won't be in English so that's enough for me to dump a few hours before it starts.
Plus it is somewhat of a universal rule.
Every coin always dumps after conferences, no matter how good the news is.
Don't get greedy, the only reason anyways buys anything other than BTC is to get more BTC and everyone will dump when it spikes up (probably will happen slightly BEFORE the conference even).
When is the conference tomoroow?
