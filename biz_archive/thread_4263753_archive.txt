Any promising ICOs?
Q4>still falling for ICO scamsshiggy
I wasn't looking into uTrust but that MC is way too high and they had a presale with like 40% off which kinda sucks.
Hopefully it tanks on an exchange.

I'll only type this one time on biz so whoever sees this, you're welcome.Insider info... Ignite ICO is way ahead of schedule so it's pushing its ICO from January to end of November.
Pre-sale coming in 2 weeks.
Whitelist now and enjoy some gains, it's the next ICO.
Already has alpha product, the website pictures actually already show it.
It's incredible.
Partnered with some nice companies already.... Not to mention Ernst & Young... One of the largest auditing firms in the world.
Only 1,750,000 coins in circulation...look at cryptocurrency market cap site and check the prices for those types of circulations.
You're welcome.
Bye biz.
