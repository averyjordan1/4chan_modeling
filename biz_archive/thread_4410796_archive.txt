Yesterday I was the first that posted on the Amex partnership.
The quick of you should have made decent gains.I am her to tell you the next run might start just now.
Be careful, though.
Pumps on ripple last exactly 30 seconds before all bagholders go running for sell.
enjoy your suffering.

I'll send you a tip if we actually get a little movement

XRP goes back to 0.18 USD soon mate.
Cant you just accept you missed the train idiot?
Why you care what i do?
I'm a holder since may and this is very good advice .
Generally you want to buy lower or on â‚¬0.18 and it goes up to 0.20-0.22 for a very brief moment.
Sell and when it drops buy again at 0.17
