For everyone invested in Bitcoin Cash.
This evening bch will have a difficulty adjustment of 400%.
Currently bch is around 9% of btc difficultly.
This means tomorrow bch must Trade around 0.36 to be profitable to mine.
What do you think the chances of this are?
I personally think this will not happen.
Hopefully the big bch whales will have gained enough capital to make the flippening happen next time
look at the charts.
its happening.
now.
Dinosaur coin, none cares
sssh, i want to see people throw moar moneyz at BCH
you have to assume they've taken concerns of mining profitability into account
I personally started moving my gains in more stable coins like Monero and ethereum.
Will leave about a third into bch to see what happens after tomorrow

Miners will swap over to BTC chain temporarily to reduce the adjustment and use the transaction fees they get to buy more BCH.Also yes, it willbe 0.36.
After the difficulty adjustment on BCH, half or more of the 5.6 remaining exahash on BTC chain will move over to BCH together with the ones who went to BTC during difficulty adjustment.It's game over for BTC.
Miners will always control proof of work blockchains and thus the coins.

wow, deluded retard.
when did you buy, 2000$, 2500$?
% of miners can go over to BTC and it won't matter.
BCH mempool doesn't get buttfucked by a lack of miners, unlike BTC.The difficulty adjustment, no matter how big, will have 0 effect on BCH price.
