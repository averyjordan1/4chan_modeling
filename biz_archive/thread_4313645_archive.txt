Youâ€™re a good son, and your dad sounds chill.
thanks, and he really is.
He never asks for anything though and always wants to act as though he's the man and has it figured out.
That's the only reason this alerts me, the fact that he called me this late for help with anything, let alone buying a cryptocoin.. TO DA MOON ANONS
