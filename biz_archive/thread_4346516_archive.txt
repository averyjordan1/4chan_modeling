How much did you start with and how long did it take you to reach 1BTC?
Seems like a distant dream for me.
Got up to 0.3 before the forks fucked everything.
turned .2 btc into 1 btc with confido
lol had you bought bcc when it was 0.05 u would have at least 3 btc right now provided you took advantage of the dips
Started .5 turned 1 BTC in a week and a half.
Fair play.
Now you actually can trade with decent money.
What are you into now can I ask?Yeah if I could tell the future I'd have a lot more than 1 btc.
the ideal was 21 Bitcoin when I got in.
I bought 4 for about $600 a piece.
just buy and hold what you have, the goal post seems to move over the years.
