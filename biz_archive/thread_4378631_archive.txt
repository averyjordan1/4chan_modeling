WEED/APH.
ACB hurts though, I knew I should've went in on all 3.
And I had $200 of bitcoin turn into $850 of bitcoin (counting the bch I never did anything with until recently) in three months.That's just holding the most normie crypto of all and never touching any altcoins
thats true, bitcoin has grown a lot lately, but this is just a suggestion for the fucking casuals like myself who cant into crypto
