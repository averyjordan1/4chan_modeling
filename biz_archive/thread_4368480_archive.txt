so close to the exclusive 100k+ LINK club.
once you're there, lambo land is literally guaranteed.
just need LINK to dip a liiiittle bit more.
LINKIE DINKIE WHERE IS MY MOONIE COOINIE LINKY LINK LINK LINKIES LINKY LINK LINK LINKIES LINKY LINK LINK LINKIES LINKY LINK LINK LINKIES HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHHHHHHHHH
I refuse to put any more fiat in crypto after going all in at the top, but I have been day trading and have hope to make it there eventually.
I'm hoping we get another nightly pump to 3k so I can dump and buy back in at 2.7 like the previous nights.
Please happen, I need more like.
I feel so naked without at least 75k Link.
btc = 36k link right now, right?I really want to recover my losses from bch and un ironically go all in on link desu.
How much link are you swingtrading and how much have you earned doing this?
Also what's your entry point?
17-18 cents?
K Link is only what 20K?It's not that exclusive.
yes, but not many have the balls to do it
No I bought all at the top around 35-40 cents.
Got totally JUST'd but believe in my decision, my research, and the fundamentals of the coin.
The fact that /biz/ is so high on the coin and the memes helped a lot too.
It not pumping to $1 at least once is a joke, so I'm holding until then before thinking of selling anything.Started with 60k Link, swing trading got me at about 67k right now.
I only swing trade half my stack on the off chance it goes to Jupiter and never dips back down again.
I would be close to 100k Link from the swing trading but I sold a bunch of the extra Link I made to buy some Req to diversify a bit, own about 140k Req now.
I feel at least one of these shitcoins should pump 5-10x by next Spring.
I have.
K Link
 more, soldier.
Doesn't look like it's going to pump tonight, but I don't feel confident to sell into this dump in hopes of buying lower so I guess I'll just see what happens tomorrow.
