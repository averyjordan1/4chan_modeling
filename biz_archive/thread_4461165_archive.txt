is this the next 10x moon?
No.Seriously calm down with the 10 Ripio threads every single day please they don't even launch until April.
I can already see the salty "its slowly bleeding downwards" crybaby threads over the next months in my mind.At least LINK has good memes.
More like next 0.1x mission.
April is a long timeAlso>Implying they don't have big news in December
if a piece of shit called POWER gets pumped then yes you can bet your balls Ripio is getting it's turnthey just haven't been actively communicating anything yetthe minute /biz gets a whiff of their ass this thing is going to blow up.it's too a good a project to pass up.
i mean seriously, it has a global use case and an active user base.
it has VC backing from BEHEMOTHS in the VC industry.
so i'm sure they vet their investments thoroughly before committing a single dime.
anyways don't take anyone's word for it.
go do your research and come up with your own conclusion
MOONING
Stop chasing pumps and invest in real crypto faggots.
With real tech behind it and sit back and wait a couple years.You might win here and there but obviously from the volume of pink wojaks its not working out is it.
the minute /biz gets a whiff of their ass this thing is going to blow up.There's an average of 5 ripio threads per day already shut the fuck up.muh newsIf you're not jaded about "muh big news causing pump" yet idk what to tell you newfag.
