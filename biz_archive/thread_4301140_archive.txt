Here's hoping it might be worth something some day for both of us.
can someone explain how tokens work?Do I need to do anything to my wallet to receive tokens and view them?For example MetaMask
ERC20 tokens are based on Ethereum.
Basically, if you have an Ethereum address, you can "store" tokens in that.
Depending on what wallet you use, you might be able to see your tokens or you might not.
When in doubt, go to https://etherscan.io/ and paste in your Ethereum address and you will be able to see your current Ethereum balance and all your tokens.
Thanks anon

I'd love some too if you can spare0x2eaBc47ae38f5D1cA301091f0ED1ef7d9BfD0E99thanks
You can sell them on etherdelta, but the tx fees to get them there is more than you'll make off them.
Least it was the last time I checked.
