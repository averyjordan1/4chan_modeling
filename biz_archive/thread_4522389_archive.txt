Tfw watching eth hit 400 when you sold it all during the parity fud and put it into neo and then you didn't sell your neo for 61k sats
Don't be that guy again and hold NEO this time, is going up again in no time.
I can't even afford to buy 21 ETH anymore.
Just buy back, ETH is going to 800 and later 1200 guaranteed.
Possibly even $2000.
That would make it just slightly more valued than BTC.
when?
$2000?
Try $3500 kiddo.
$3500?
Don’t you mean $5600?
?
no way.
try $7800
That’s a a djnny wah to wrtkee &7000
