Decentralized and uncensored torrents that pay, and it solves the megaupload problem.
this will be huge.
What's max supply and is that token address legit?
Why is it so much cheaper than ico?
Who would sell their tokens under ico price
It's a damn solid project imo.
I'm expecting this to hover around ico price once this hits exchanges.
obvious shill thread with Ip swapping poster.sage.
Read the whitepaper.
yes It's cheap on ED, very few people know how to access unlisted tokens.
people got early adopter discounts that put their cost around 0.0007 ethThere was also about 15 - 20 people who received an airdrop for memes.Then there is the guy who started all this madness, a user from bitcointalk scammed a couple of people out of their fenx and started a really bad pump to dump his stolen coins.Really i'd have preferred it if these coins had stayed under the radar until the ICO completedThere is hundreds of people who bought fenx ico, there is probably another 80 or so who have bought off ED.. no shill.. i tried hard to keep it simple.

How do you know all this?
Are you on the team?
Sounds like a scam.
What's the price btw?
Yeah no thanks.
Someone already scammed people there on bitcointalk and is now dumping on ED.
Stay away.
One person who isn't even on the team doesn't mean the whole project is a scam.Fucking brainlet
that scammer has dumped, he's gone he no longer holds, but he snowballed all of this 'sell now' mentality..i have his name and personal information, if anyone wants it i'll post it up.
i hate scammers.
If you aren't buying this already you hate money.
Do you hate money?
