Been hearing a lot of rumors about Factom lately (such as some group plans to pump it to $50, that Teeka Tiwari will keep shilling it, etc.)
so I bought some this morning on the dip, and wish I bought more now instead of NEO, fuck.It's been going up and up, I'm actually really happy (made up for some of my losses lately!)
but I just want to know if this is fueled by anything big or if I should sell right now and take profit
Alleged pump today I hear.
Seems to have already been pumped though.
Any one else know?
The pump of the next he is on PBC rumors I think.
Not enough volume to be a coordinated pump.
PAJEETS FUCK OFF THIS BOARD
Do you have a link to PBC rumors?Fuck my weak hands.
Last PBC rumor I bought into was ZEN, and I sold WAAAAY too early (doubted the rumors), and missed out on like 150% profit.Maybe this is my chance for revenge?!
?1This time I'm thinking oft just holding and buy more.
It's on a dip right now
Take it with a grain of salt though ...
Given they blew the last call apparently.https://bittox.com/2017/11/13/leaked-palm-beach-confidential-november-edition/
