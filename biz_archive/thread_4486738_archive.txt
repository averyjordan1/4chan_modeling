The FBI is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin with about 150,000 coins, worth about $1.2 trillion.
Currently the national debt stands at a bit over $20.5 trillion.
That means if Bitcoin can raise to over $100,000 (which isnt unimaginable), the government could simply pay the debt back with crypto.I thought of this while thinking about the whole "NSA/CIA are Satoshi Nakamoto" conspiracy theory.
If true, this could help explain the China FUD too.
Just something to think about.
>$1.2 trilliontopkek
why are you so bad at math?
pay the debt backTOPKEK
eh, rounding
There's no paying back the debt.
The debt is there by design.
The dollar is debt.
When ever the fed prints money they do it by letting the government borrow money with Treasury bonds for interest.
Then that borrowed money is deposited into banks, then they take 90% of it and loan it out again, then when it's deposited into another bank they take 90% and loan it out again and again.
If all debts were paid off we'd have no dollars.
$1.2 trillion.>BTC market cap ~$140 billion
Bitcoin with about 150,000 coins>worth about $1.2 trillionBURGER MATHS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
If all debts were paid off we'd have no dollars.

holy fuck i don't even know where to begin.150,000 x 8300 = 1,245,000,000 : 1.245 billion150,000 x 100,000 = 15billionif the FBI has 150,000bitcoins.
each bitcoin would need to be worth 140million fucking USD to pay off the national debt.
Dumbass.
What is bitcoins market cap?Now how much USD did you say the FBI has in BTC?Are you retarded?
