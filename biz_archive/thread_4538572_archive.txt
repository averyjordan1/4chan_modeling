I have 200$ to invest in cryptoREQ vs LINK.
What's gonna make me a millionaire?
None you cheap faggot.
You need more capital.
Neither.
Pump&dump meme shitcoins with no working product.
You are welcome
Don't starve yourself OP.
Go buy your groceries today with that money.
But this is disposable income.
I have money in BTC and XMR.
I have 200$ to lose on a high risk-high reward coin
200$>high riskjust joking bro.I guess you should go with Link, just a feeling.
Neither of those.
Look at DNA
Neither, you stupid faggot.
Wait for BTC to crash and then buy as much as you possibly can.
Investing in anything other than BTC is retarded.
REQ is honestly your only real shot at making even 10x your money.
Go half and half.
The chance both will fail are very low.
If only one of them succeeds, you'll get a decent chunk of profit.
Maybe enough to buy a house if you wait until 2nd half 2019.
