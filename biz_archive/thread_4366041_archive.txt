Can we start having /bot/ general threads here on /biz/?
I know most of you are brainlets but some aren't and I think a little bit of knowledge exchange couldn't hurt.Basically, trading strategies, algorithms, analysis related to trading bots.
General trading advice would also be welcome.
I was running a Forex CFD bot which entered trades when stochastic was crossing from top/bottom and Bollinger was outside of Keltner, to avoid trading during squeezes.
It only entered long if candles were above MA and short below MA.
1h candles.
It had an amazing accuracy but didn't make trades very often so I ditched it, I don't have enough money for it running to make much sense.
Feel free to use this idea on your own if you're into steady but slow money.
Bots are for pajeets and brainlets
