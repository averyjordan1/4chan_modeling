there are two americans in chancoin: scammer gossamer socks and desperate, angry, autistic bagholder alexgreenbagholders say they're not selling because they "believe" but in reality they couldn't sell if they wanted to.. there's no one bidding.. when there are bids, they're tiny.
no one can cash out, which explains the incessant spamming every day for those who were wondering
bump
bump!
