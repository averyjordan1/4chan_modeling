Or perhaps Satoshi was a simple salary man who wanted to do something meaningful for once.. decided to create something he thought of, and years later, watching the success, smiled to himself.Satoshi looked at his wife and 6 year old remember the time when he didn't feel that he'd ever make a mark on the world, now beyond that first attempt.

A notebook lay in his desk drawer, a notebook his wife thought odd, since it was just random strings of numbers and letters..
Minister you, Satoshi!
