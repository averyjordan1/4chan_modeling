Will Bitcoin kill alts again with his uptrend?
Its all going into Ethereum.
By end of year we're going up 100%,maybe 200% or more on ETH
Sorry mate I've asked a serious question...you responded with a joke.
mmm new money is flowing in it seems, so its going into altcoins and bitcoin so where the money goes into which altcoin and they will go up
WHENEVER BTC MOVES, DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S UP OR DOWN, ALTS ALWAYS BLEED, ALWAYS.
THIS SHOULDBENOTHINGNEWIT HAPPENEDHUNDREDS OF TIMESALREADY
It doesn't dumbo, if new money flows in then that means people don't sell their altcoins to bitcoins it comes from the outside, new money is actually flowing in right now, look in pic related how altcoins and bitcoin is going up expect bitcoin cash, also look athe market capatlisatin, it went up a lot so money is flowing to all coins
i hope so, need to fill up my bags again
no.
alts should recover now since theres no reason to hold btc
