Thinking, should I sell off the rest of my POWR?
Or should I just hold onto it?
I sold of 3/4 already
sell obviously, it's just going to dip for awhile.
might be worth holding the 3/4 when u try to FOMO when it skyrockets again
The hype already hit its peak and now it'll bleed as people sell off
Nah, it'll hype again once the demos start happening or more news comes out
Should have sold yesterday.
Just hold at this point
