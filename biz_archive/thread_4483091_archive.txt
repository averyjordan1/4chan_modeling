Biz you're pretty good at buying high and selling low.
Why don't you just short instead?
How do I short shitcoins senpai ?
I always do, thanks for the advice anyway.
I only buy and HODLno highs or lows if you don't plan on selling
That's because you're looking at pajeet pnd threads and fools that fall for their tricks.
"Sell" means buy, "buy" means sell.
