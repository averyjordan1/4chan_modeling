CFD 2.0?
I'm confused about this referance after today.
Are you saying good ICO or scam?
Wondering about the general sentiment on it.
Went 20x and then back to 2x with no word from the team
Well it might be on 0.03 but the project is dead let's be honest and that assuming that it wasn't actually a scam which I belive it was.
>they honestly thought the token burn would do anything
what is the name of the coin btw, cant tell from an img
i lost 300$ on this help, should i contact my lawyer?
If you bought on ICO maybe, otherwise no.
UpfiringI put 5 eth into this at .0003.
Fucking sux
ok so from a quick look into reddit, social media.
Yeah, it looks like cfd 2.0 :(
why wouldn't they ride it out longer?
they just took the ICO money and ran?
maybe because scammers are as imaptient as the whole crypto market.
Quick gains/loses but also quick scams.
Just my theory.
