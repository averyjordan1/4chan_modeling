Was /biz/ wrong again?
% of the "happenings" on /biz/ are fucking nothing.
That's why blissfully ignorant, oblivious normies that just buy and hold and go party are making more money than most of you.
Why wold anything happen to it?
Just some stupid FUD, they make milions per day legally, why would they exit scam.
I wanna be a normie
It hurts me to admit that this is probably correct.
I would have been up way more just buying and holding BTC since April :'(
