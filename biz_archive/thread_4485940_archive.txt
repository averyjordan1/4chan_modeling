GRS releases their roadmap in 4hrs, looks like there was a bit of accumulation.
I made $300 off it just in last nights pump, which I thought WAS the roadmap announcement kek .Now I'm back in it for more comfee gains
Is this fake?
Anyone?
Not fake.
Their website has a countdown.
Rumors of a rebranding too.
No numbnuts, check their twitter
bought at 700 yesterday night, sold at 750 while sleeping, durp.
Figure this roadmap pump is already priced in desu
It absolutely is
So what's our move?
Buy in at anything below 770 and try to make small profit in 4 hours?
Don't touch?
What do you think.
