Someone's at the door, /biz/.
He says he can reach $350.
He just needs you to let him in.Will you let ETH in?
Feels like heâ€™s gonna bounce off 350 and fall back to 330.
i need it to go to 300 for another month
no
just needs to tickle 350
Next time Bitcoin loses 10%, eth will double
Pedocoin get out
Why dont you have a seat
Hello Dear Ethereum,Please just stop at $350 for now, then drop to $330 again.
I will buy lots of you if you do that for me.
Leave it to devops
Bought 15 a week ago.
Pretty comfy.
Sure it's going up but the volume's not there.
Probs back to 330 or less after a while.
Cant, I'm already all in.
