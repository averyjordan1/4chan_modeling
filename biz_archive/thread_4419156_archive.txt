Seen a lot of “Getting JUST’D by ASTRO” lately.If you can’t learn to hold for more than 2 days, I can’t help you.The current price on ED is beyond a steal, let me break this project down for you biz:4,000,000 Circulating SupplyAstronaut App launches December 1st 2017First dividends awarded December 30th 2017Already partnered with Ambisafe and MLG BlockchainLet's recap.
Working product in 2 weeks, already partnered, dividends at EOY, 4 mil tokens after burn.Those are the facts and if you need more then DYOR.
Don't come crying when the dip is gone and we're back above .009 ETH.We've all seen how EPY, HST, GRX have bounced back from their respective dips..005 seems to be a clear bottom for ASTRO.
down -30% WAKE ME UP INSIDE
Honestly, haven't felt more comfy than I do rn.
Bought at .06, easy 2x gains coming in.
This is a token that I actually agree with biz on.
>they trade icos/shitcoins and pay you in dividends.
Best investment thus far and perfect for people like me who are sick of having to keep up with every new shitcoin and ico that hits the market.Hold this for a year.
Seriously.
Missed all the astro hype when it was on ED early.
So much FOMO when I saw it at $3.
Might have to finally hop in this one now.
Update: I'm in the game now at 0.00461Hope ur right biz
4419264Whoops, confirmed shill here.
LOL
Another tip, OP, is that all of the posts in this thread even sound like they were written by the same person, and with almost no time apart.
A true 0/10 samefag.
Honestly.
In all my crypto years, I’ve never seen weaker hands than fucking /biz/ NEETs.
They have trouble holding for 3 hours
Apart from OP being a brainlet I do agree with his shill.
Astro does feel like a solid project.
Damn.
busted.I have put a little money into it too.
I'll hold at least til the dividend.
Might be worth it.
How's it going OP?
They want to get listed as a sec token on poloniex.
They don't have a clue of what they are doing in cryptospace.
