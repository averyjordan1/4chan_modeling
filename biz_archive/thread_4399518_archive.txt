Hey guys this is an actual question.I literally have no idea how am I supposed to exchange my btc to money, but I already have googled for about 20 minutes>sell it on a site which offers to buy btcokay okay I tried that but I have a concern:this site said I had to transfer the btc in the next 15 min or the offer will expire how the hell is that possible if they are like 100k unconfirmed transactions already??
?Do my bitcoins get lost?what if the price of the btc changes meanwhile?>localbitcoinsdoesn't exsist in germany>german localbitcoin thing already contacted some guys but they don't respond, I also don't know how that would work.
Do I have to transfer them with my smartphone on a meeting or what?pls guys I am a student who has less than half a btc but it's lots of money for me.my btc are saved on blockchain, if that matters
