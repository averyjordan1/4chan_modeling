Why has no other coin, apart from BTC, come anywhere near the $1000 price mark?
Is there a legit reason for this, or simply because BTC has been around the longest?>which crypto do you think will reach $1000 first>when do you think it will reach 1k>why do you think it will reach 1k
BCH will be there by next week
byteball came pretty close I think
Google 'total supply'.
Boom, /thread
because of circulating supply.
