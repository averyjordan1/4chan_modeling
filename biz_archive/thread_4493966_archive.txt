Is this the end of Buttcoin?
The downtrend is obvious.
I can draw eight points on that graph that could be interpreted as the end of bitcoin...It's became apparent that bitcoin may never be 1k, 2k, 3k even 5k ever again.
A lot of people don't like this... they sold at every major psychological barrier and we blew through all of them They can't go back in time.
They have too much pride to by back in at a loss.
There's only one thing to do.Use your brains anons
It's just the start of the periodic dip, won't fall below 6000 tho
This is just the beginning.
There's only one thing to do.Throw a big temper tantrum and FUD the fuck out of biz?
this is no time for caution.
op
if bitcoins seriously trends bellow 8k (not just for 20 mins) and it hits < 7,900 i would 50% your investment, this growth is unprecidented for even bitcoin and booking profit when youre sure of it is better than losing it all and becoming bitter at the king
YeahSeems pretty suss how the bch shilling vanished then all tether fud shows upBut whatever
