How do you do this?
Im serious I never shorted a company
15% in profit already
Why?
Fundamentals or TA?
Is this a meme?
Short: x short>You have 1 share>Broker gives you 10 shares>You sell those 10 shares>Price of shares go down>You buy back those 10 shares>Since price went down, it cost you less than what you sold for>Return shares>Keep profit
It dropped to a technical low.
why?
everything they do is instantly copied by fb, target audience not gonna expand, etc.
I'm only trading it, snapchat is fucking useless.Closed the trade with 30% profit btw.
nice anon, how much did you put down?
on which plateform are you trading shares?>t.
a coiner with no experience of real stock market
doesnt look sustainable as a business model...i think its highly overrated.
this is like maximum speculation op, snapchat has not neccessary much substance.

You borrow a book from your friend that has a market price of 20 bucks.
Your friend wants $2 deposit.
He also says that if market price of the book goes over 22$ he will come to you, take the book without giving back the $2.You sell the book for $20.Later the market price drops to $10.
You buy a book again, give it back to your friend, he gives you back the $2.THIS is what shorting is.
