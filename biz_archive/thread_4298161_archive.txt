not sure what this meansBittrex API
shit, forgot to add linkhttps://bittrex.com/api/v1.1/public/getcurrenciesby the way speaking of link, I searched for LINK and it is not fucking there you delusional fucking linktards lol
That flag implies some kind of IOTA token imo.
sorry buck-o, if you look at the API, you'll notice coins are added in order of when they're added to bittrex.
They may have planned to add IOTA months ago, but never did.
No reason for them to add it now.that has been in their API for awhile (months)
That's trollcoin (which they delisted) not iota.
I don't believe we have guys like you on this board
