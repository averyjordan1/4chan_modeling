biz, I come to you seeking great help.A long time ago, I had an online BTC wallet on blockchain, which I forgot about.
It only had about 0.1 BTC, but still.
I tried logging in but forgot my password unfortunately.I have backups of the wallet, but assume id still need the password to get in?Anyone have any advice for me please, or failing that, willing to help a poor South African out?
All I want to do is trade a bit and join you guys on moon missions.1PXQNC2E89VThbu1ienMmrXmmERiLeKX5dGreatly appreciated
Bumping
and another one

Yes
Thanks.Is it at all possible to brute force the password, or will it lock me out after a certain amount of attempts?
You didn't save your private key anywhere?say goodbye to it.
Another .1btc joins the millions in limbo
Nope, I was an idiot.I think I might know parts of the password though, is there a program that could help possibly?
Could any kind anon help me with some coins to get trading please?
