I'm a begginer in crypto...So, i need your help /biz.
On binance I want to buy NEO, but can only deposit with other crypto currencies.
I cant really deposit money, so how do I start this?
.......
Because Binance is an exchange.You need to go on websites like coinbase, and buy ETH/other crypto and then, you send it to binance and buy your Neo
thank you anon
Buy BTC or ETH using fiat on a normie friendly major exchange like Coinbase or Kraken.>Send to appropriate wallet on your Binance account>Use BTC/ETH to buy NEO on Binance.
Binance doesn't deal in fiat (hence why you don't have to give them any ID), you need to already have some crypto to deposit and trade for other crypto.
You need to first sign up and verify at an exchange that will let you bank transfer fiat to trade for Bitcoin.
so I want to start small today.
If i buy Litecoin and then buy NEO, that would be ok?
no, binance doesn't have LTC/NEO pair.
just buy a fraction of ETH if you want to start small
thank you!
