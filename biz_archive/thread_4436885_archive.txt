Can someone else calm my nerves about this chink coin?
Is this shit really gonna go parabolic?
I'm getting fucked by the minute What if they started dumping as the conference is going on now or are they gonna wait till Monday for the official conference to dump this piece of shit?
if the news is at all related to government backing then its automatically better than ETH, no reason not to hold
Everyone's gonna dump before the conference though, right?
No way I'm gonna be one of the few hodling
he still believes the rumorheh
why would you dump before?no real proof saying the rumour isn't true other than a few anonymous people on /biz/ .. gg.
This a meme shit coin.. check their github.. looks like middle school coding workshop.
Now check QTUM and see who the real deal is.
Now that you did that, check coinmarketcap to see what the"asians" are buying.
Here's a hint.
It's NOT FOOKING NEO.
