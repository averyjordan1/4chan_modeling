>money cant buy you happiness :^)Why don't normies realize money supersedes everything?
making money makes me happy
https://youtu.be/3lhpWkv_WwsTed DiBiase tells is like it is.
the only people who say that money doesnt buy happiness are poor peopleive never met an unhappy rich person
It doesn't supersede being Chad and having prime goddesses actually wanting, and enjoying sex with you, which is why being Chad is invaluable.
>>S+ThaGzKTrust me, there are plenty of them
It doesn't, but money does equal freedomAnd freedom = happiness
Im a NEET with no money and Im more happy than you'll ever be.
Money won't get you a partner or friends who like you for you
ive only heard that from rich people talking to poor people
its a lie
>mo money mo problemsproblems only comes when people know you got money, suddenly everbody is telling you their sob stories
This contempt for money is just another trick of the rich to keep the poor without it.

implyingmoney >>>>>> sex
Nobody thinks this.

Point is, you will never have girls enjoy sex with you unless you are Chad>inb4 I don't care if they enjoy itYou do because it's part of ennjoying it yourself unless you are autistic as fuck.
you always live with the lingering doubt that your parents will kick you out though
What if nobody likes me for me now?
Money can buy happiness.
But money can't prevent unhappiness.
