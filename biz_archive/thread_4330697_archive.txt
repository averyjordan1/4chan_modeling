>create bitfinex account>fails everytime I generate ETH address (same with ETC, but not BTC or others)Only other option I see is some ausfag site which requires referrels and doesn't let you trade unless you are verified and aussie.
Is there any other way?
You can also buy on binance.
Why does it fail to make you an ETH address btw?
Oh yeah and I don't want to just conver the ETH to BTC because I'll have to shuffle it around 2 different exchanges.
Slow and costly.
binanceOk thanksI get this error>The Ethereum watchonly daemon is restarting, please come back in a few minutes.Googling turns up an issue from 6 months ago they claimed got fixed.
try sending to bitfinex with LTC or try binance
Why don't you literally just take cash out of the bank and flush it down the toilet?
errorThat's weird.
But binance should work then.
wtf somehow when I tried to withdraw iota from binance it truncated the address.
The pending withdrawal is to an invalid address and the real address shows no history here iotasear.chAnyone know what will happen?
It's just a test amount.
I of course copied and pasted the address, going to try another test to see if I screwed up or they did.
This fud is a step up from what I'm used to reading.
Ok so I can see in the confirmation email that the address was correct and not truncated.
Some redditor also complained about difficulties but didn't mention the address problem.What happens to the transaction, it must be invalid if it's truly truncated.
Because it's not fud you stupid fuck.
Withdrawal history page shows the wrong address and after 30 minutes still no coin.
Yeah, I'm sure David got high and froze your account.
Better contact the foundation and get in line, goy.
