>REQ and ARKThis week has been brutal
You have been warned about REQ ;)
>holding a scamcoin and a coin that already mooned too muchwhy do you hate money op?
set buy for 400 on req.
believe it or not it already mooned from 400 to 1000. this is the dump phase
That's still overvalued for a fcking WP project
wow it's almost like all alts are taking a dump
REQ is a medium-long term hold.How would some weekly fluctuation matter at all?You're not some day trader faggot or a pump chaser are you?
