Ark is it.
The One.
The coin that will elevate my life to the lofty heights I have always known I am destined for.
A way of living so advanced - so luxurious and secure - that the average human brain cannot even begin to imagine.
I could help them, too.
Tell them to buy Ark right now.
To be the early adopter.
To finally do something to better their pathetic life, to take a chance; to dream.
Allow them, sometime in the future, to boast amongst their mouth breathing, pea brained friends about how obvious the brilliance of Ark was.
To tell the fat, sweaty, steaming piles of garbage they refer to as friends that they knew, well before the magnificent vision, the unrivalled team and the breathtaking tech that is Ark transformed the world, how they knew it was destined for greatness.
But I won’t.
I won’t tell them.
Wont help them out.
Won’t throw them a bone.
A lifesaver.
A way out.
Why?
Because I gain nothing from that.
More importantly, I lose something.
Something big.
I lose the ability, sometime in the not too distant future, when Ark has taken hold of all the blockchains and a new generation of elites have been born, I lose the ability to call them what has become the most offensive, obscene word known to man.I lose the ability to call them a noArkie.
I mean, that's still $11,000 in a year.Spend it on a nice vacation.
2400 here, not even half of what I want
whale
It never ends.
I have nearly 34k but want at least 50k
 here, hoping to get to 5k before the moon mission really begins
one of you faggots convinced me to buy some ark 2 days ago instead of just going all into neo 28$ and omg and I want to kms now
>tfw only 6000 Ark
That's well over $100,000.
Stop being greedy anon
I would sell my stash and get back to day trading but I know the moment I do a giant green candle will appear and take this coin straight to 6.50 a piece
onlyBreh poorfags here would kill for that much
T H E
CONFERENCE

Is ark starting to moon?

Yes.

I'm a small fish like you, how do we get more?
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SAYING THIS ABOUT ARK SINCE FUCKING JULYI BOUGHT AT 2.60 AND THIS SHITCOIN DOES NOTHING BUT HOVER AT 3 DOLLARSFUCK OFF
It was only like 50 cents in July dude
Tell me about it, 18.5k arklet here.
I feel so small...
People have been saying this since February.
If you'd bought then you'd have bought @ $0.25 or 18k sats.
Either way you'd be much wealthier right now.It's your own damn fault if you're late to the game.
who /ark/ here?
Is the faucet down for anyone else??
Yep, oh well, as long as they back their shit up or the database for pendings is elsewhere.
just sold all my ark for the CVC train
