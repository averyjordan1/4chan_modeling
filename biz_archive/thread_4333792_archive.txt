Don't worry goys.
If BCH looks like it's about to run mad, it definitely isn't.I repeat.
Not a rocket.Your classic bitcoin is doing just fine?
Right?I mean.
I wouldn't try to sell it or anything.Or move it.Just hodl.
Itll probably be finebut there is always a chance things will go bottom up
don't post this pepe
Agreed on BCH being dead.
You're definitely right.
And agreed on BTC doing fine.
Hodling nice and comfy for the rocket to 10k this coming week.
Awesome post anon!
ITT: people who didn't sell their bch at the top Keep desperately holding onto your bags waiting for that bull run to come back faggots.At least in a few months you'll have the 3rd "flippening" where a bunch of newfags are tricked into buying your bags.
Meanwhile my BTC will have 2x'd by then
Problem?
i agree.
bad pepe
