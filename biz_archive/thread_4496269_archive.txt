I post 1-2 ads a day on cl advertising my pretty successful small business.
My scummy competition posts 10+ (exact same, identical) ads a day and has mine removed by auto flagging.
The worst part is I have tried to reason with the guy using the "There are plenty of customers for everyone, lets all play by the rules" argument but he instantly goes to threats of violence and name calling.
The worst part is, he is a terrible vendor and rips people off.
I need help.
Any ideas?
Obviously I am willing to pay for the right kind of help here.
I understand NYPA very well.
Thanks.

Document your interactions with him, especially the ones involving threats.
Don't censor your own side, it will look bad.
Demonstrate that he's abusing the flagging function and threatening you, and put it in front of craigslist.
Yes, be a snitch.Unless you're doing something illegal.
Then you're just going to have to play his game and get better at it than he is.
Or become a proper snitch.
