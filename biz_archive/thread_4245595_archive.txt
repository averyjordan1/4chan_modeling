ITS FUCKING LOW ASS MARKETCAP + STRTEGIC PARTNERS WITH CHAINLINK AGGGGGGG
>STRTEGIC PARTNERS WITH CHAINLINKhow is that a positive thing?
nice just bought 10k
So, you'd like us to buy your bags OP?
It had a hard cap under a fucking million for it's ico u haramchooths, and it's a good coin
buy muh bagsIt's about x14 from ICO mate.
Nobody is holding bags.
don't worry man, just buy and wait for it to hit CMC, THEN the fuckers will listen
seriously?
what was ico price?
it's listed already
starting price on CMC is 0.33 hahah
/7000, about 0.000143 ETH
everybody who buys now at x14 ICO price will be a solid bagholder for some time
If it started at .33 and it's currently at .55 how is it 14x ICO price?
it starts at 0.33 only for the normies that will look it up on CMC, and wouldn't know it's already x14 ICO
Hope no one here is falling for this scamcoin
don't waste your time fudding before the proper moon mission
Confido listing on Kucoinhttps://www.reddit.com/r/confido/comments/7bkd6f/confido_is_listing_on_kucoin/
The max going around at ICO was 450k-worth, which is NOTHING.
So few people got in on that.If they raised 10 million during ICO and it went up to 15 million, you guys would be going WOW ONLY 1.5X ICO, BUY NOWGoes up 15x from 450k, still at ~6million market cap, and NOW it's risky?Come the fuck on.
don't tell them, they don't listen, I don't even care anymore
I bought some yesterday, set a sell order for some of my stack at 2x last nightWoke up to it closed.
That was fast...glad I have some left
Dont try to defend your bags, have fun holding these bags that the 2 ICO Buyers will dump on your face
