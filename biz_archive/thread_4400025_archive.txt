Well, /biz/, I invested $15,000 in COSS 1 month ago, and now it's worth $5000.That was my tuition money for Spring semester.Gotta have to take summer classes now and pay for them by working minimum wage Jan-May.Fuk.
put your 5 grand in BAT instead and break even by the end of the year
honestly, buy astro and hold for the december payout, it should be a few thousand for a decent stack of astro

If you invest in dogecoin you can get your money back.
You won’t make more than that but you’ll at least get your money back.

It's not over yet though, hold that shit.Coss will come back eventually.
You just bought at the wrong time.
