Say it with me:PRICED IN
Sadly is everything that will happen and that can happen already priced in
Tomorrow: Chainlink announces partnership with China, Russia and US governments to implement their platform into every applicable thing possible.LINK's price tanks down to $0.12
as much as i love the project, until BTC link will get the picture related treatment
Link can't handle good news.
It's like the opposite of OMG.
It's zero hype on the developer side and all their partners are showing them off while the price tanks.
if ( news == good ) { priced_in = true }if (news == bad ) { priced_in = false }any questions

this tbqh
The amount of money his thumbs have cost me 9
At this point I suspect only doomsday news like the impending extinction of all mankind on planet earth could increase LINK price.
Good news will only make things worse.
