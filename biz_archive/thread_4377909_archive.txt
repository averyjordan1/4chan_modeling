ive been stuck on this block for days now and im trying to get my eth out of this wallet.
is there any way to send them without having it fully sync?
use myetherwallet noob
I don't know about that specific wallet but yeah, you don't need to be synced to send a transaction
I am having the same problem sometimes.Close your ethereum wallet, otherwise it will not workThen start up geth in the terminal in light mode> geth --syncmode "light"after that, open up your wallet and send your transactionTips are appreciated ;)0xA048b0034506E3e2efa1361f3B551326239bcF40
Just click launch application and switch to light mode
