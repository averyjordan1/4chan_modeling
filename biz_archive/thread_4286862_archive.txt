why didn't 'le flippening' happen when bitcoin cash reached 0.3 btc in august, what is different now?
satoshi's vision
x failed.
in august nobody could really trade bitcoin cash yet unless you held your bitcoin in certain exchanges during the fork.
by the time people had figured out how to split their coins and exchanges were able to turn on depositing the coins, the supply was artificially low so the price pumped
nothing, it's just a clever pump and dump taking advantage of BTC's inevitable correction after it's massive rally.
what's your fucking problem bro?
are you trying to fud Bitcoin Cash?
Fucking wack as shit bruh.
Bitcoin Cash is already worth more than Bitcoin because it's the true Bitcoin that keeps aligned with Satarshi's vision for what cryptocurrency should be.
Fucking assholes don't understand this shit saying shit like "Bitcoin cash was already .3btc why didn't it go higher" fucking retards don't understand that Donald Trump is personally invested in Bitcoin cash (don't ask for proof, I won't break confidence).
Now if someone as smart and successful as Donald Trump is involved in Bitcoin cash, where do you think you should be?
Fucking /biz/ man, can't take it anymore with these pajeet larpers doing the fake giveaway threads talking shit about bitcoin cash.
Reminder that 1 BTC in August was only about $4000
this is quite possibly the closest to the truth, but hard to say for sure right now

bullshit, Trump is balls deep in Chainlink
I didn't say he wasn't, but he is heavily invested in Bitcoin cash as well.
well he's a fucking gook so he's probably myopic
