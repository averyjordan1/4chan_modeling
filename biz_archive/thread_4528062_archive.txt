Heard about this from my brother who's friends with the developer.
It's a bitcoin investment platform marketed entirely to normies.
I don't give a shit about the platform itself personally, but do you think it could have an effect on BTC if it were to get really popular?https://medium.com/blockbox/investing-in-bitcoin-made-effortless-69e798b40bdf
