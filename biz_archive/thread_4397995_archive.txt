Hey /biz/Honest question here.I've been living in Japan for the past 6 years, attending college, and soon I'll be thrust into the work force.I don't have a lot of money, since I'm paying for this all on my own, but I do have about 10,000yen (about $80) that I could invest for my first time into BTC.Would this be a wise decision?
It's killing me because every month I'm only left with barely enough money for food.Watching BTC rise each day while not having a substantial amount of capital causes me grief.What should I do?
Ah, I guess I don't need a trip.Anyway, I hope some of you have some advice.
Save more money, at least 500$ and then buy eth to trade it for prosperous alts.
Alright.
Thanks.
Is there any further reading that can help me understand this more?
