Shill me on this coin.
I personally don't use social media but know every other person is pretty much addicted it seems.
Does this have potential to be next twitter Facebook?
Next twitter of facebook?
No, but it will likely grow and has some potential.
It might be akin to something like the next reddit.
Reddit and Steem will never reach facebook size because ultra-normies don't like the format (I've heard this from multiple coworkers--they don't like Reddit because it looks "outdated" to them and it doesn't have big images everywhere like Instagram or Facebook.
