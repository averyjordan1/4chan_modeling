Rumor on telegram is Dcorp will require KYC to convert to DRPS (Dividend Token) and the devs on telegram were saying they want the platform to be extremely compliant with regulations and that the next update can be taken good or bad, and from my experience this is a bad sign, dump has already started too.
Ah, so that's why its going down.
Doesn't matter too much to me as this was always going to be a long hold.
Thanks for the info.
NOTHING CAN STOP THE CORP
So glad I sold this shit for HST two days ago.
is there a token to fund the extermination of these kyc fascists?
Ethereum
In all seriousness, what happened to the voting stuff?
We got to vote on whether or not to release the tokens, but not on this KYC shit?
So they just let token holders vote on shit that's not important?
Sold at 0.006 lol, which one of you bought my bags?
