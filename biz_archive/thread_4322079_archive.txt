>Be me >In Uni, sophomore year>going around campus >Young black man approaches me>talks about how he is in a business class or some shit and is selling magazines to help win a class contest>not really interested but he sticks close to me and wont let me leave>now says that if he wins he also gets a scholarship>ok weird but fine>keeps talking, can probably tell Im about to leave>says that his mom is giving gift cards to people who buy from him, so I will get a magazine subscription and a $20 gift card>I should have know this was a scam at this point but I was naive and givign into the conman pressure tactics>he leads me to a ATM as I get him $50>gives me some slip of paper for the subscription>feel weird about the whole thing after its over>get back to my apartment, look up the company on the slip >the company is reported by the BBB for being a known scam>later that day Uni police send out a notice about con artists scamming peopleEver since then I have just told people on the street asking for anything to go fuck off, it sucks but I guess $50 is not a bad price to pay to learn that niggers are not to be trusted.
