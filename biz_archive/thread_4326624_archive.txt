What are some reasonable stocks that pay share dividends.
*?
intc, pg and ge are ones i have my eye on
BX pays a whopping 6%.
Top rated NEET stock for 2018
That sounds nice, I don't know how risky it would be though.
I was thinking IBM because it would be pretty solid, theirs is 4%.Intel I could go for also.
I sold my GE because the energy sector has been shit lately.
