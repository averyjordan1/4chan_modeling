Muh alts...
who cares.
it's just a shitcoin.
buy eth xvg and adt.
Wait a few days you impatient fuck, they just released the segwit2x cancellation news a few hours ago so the news hasnt spread that much yet.
Plus, too many people shorted BTC the moment the fork was cancelled so they are trying to liquidate those shorts.
I sold at 7300 thinking it would go down more.
JUST.
But it looks like this shit is consolidating.
Buy ETH and LTC.
They don't bleed you in transaction fees for your (((speedy))) 2 hour transfer.
10k by December 1.
Lock it in.
