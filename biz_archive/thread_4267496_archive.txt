I'm the guy that tipped you all on NULS 2 nights ago.
to those of you that missed it, pay attention.
there is another coin that will guaranteed 10x in the next few days.
It's just been put on ED recently and will be on many other exchanges extremely soon.
Hint me senpai
You made me a lot of money on NULS.
Thanks OP
Itâ€™s ELTCoin, look at the name of the gif.
Enjoy!
>buying an airdropped shit token no
Thx bought 100k
Have you seen their roadmap?They already have a wallet app out.
Delet this OP.I'm not finished accumulating
Its just on ED, not bittrex?
Dude, these guys are begging, BEGGING, to be on a this shitty exchange.
Don't cause people to lose their money.
You aren't the original anon to recommend nuls.
If you are the op please move some money from your other wallet.
And actually say the name of the coin.
Shill me
who gives a fuck?
it's a useless erc20 airdropped scam coin.
I could just as well store it in mew.
Stick to your bitcoin.
you'll make a little money over the next few years.
Ollie was fast to realise he might need more people on the team, so he recruited some early Community members to his cause (@darkimpulse and @ricksanchz).
After having not slept for over 24 hours, he reached out to his former boss/fintech guy (@augmentedinvestor) and superstar engineer (@vicdu81) for an emergency lifeline.
This is literally on the whitepaper, very professional.Also, the dev is the one who create that PnD token eLTC.Stay away.
