Well guys I did it again.
I listened to /biz/ for advise on what shitcoin to buy next.
I'm down about -1000% and I'm thinking of hanging myself.
HOWEVER being the degenerate gambling addict I am in willing to listen to you one last time.
SHILL ME ON THE NEXT BEST THING.

What didn't I lose money on...
I bought BTG at $145 its over $400 on Binance now.
I bought high and sold low on LINK, DNT, ZRX, TNT, REQ, ENJ and many more fuck boy coins I can't even remember.
Holy fuck.
Bless your heart anon.
Honestly though, why do you ever sell at a loss?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I shouldn't tell you this because I'm still waiting on Zionbase to give me my fucking ETH, but I'll take pity on you.
Buy SALT, and buy a lot of it.
triggered by racial slurs>uses homophobic slurs
How come u didn't listen to the bch shills?
Enjin is such an underlooked item.
I think everyone that loss due to dumping has been quietly accumulating.
This is a legit company and has a legit product - why can't others see this?
Credence coin.There was a huge run-up, a drop, and the price was swinging back up until that piece of shit Mercatox exchange did a "15 minute server upgrade" that lasted three hours.
Then the coin tanked after that.It's close to its lowest price point, and it's a lending coin.
Even if you don't trust lending programs and think they're a Ponzi scheme, go look at the price of Bitconnect and Regalcoin.
Once people start lending these coins, their values are locked in and it's hard for them to lose value.
Credence will begin their lending program in December, which will cause the price to skyrocket.
So you can either buy low now, wait till the coin gains exponential value, and:1.
Sell, make 10x profit (at least)2.
Lend at a 10x rate of what you paid for the coin.Win/win
Give your dick to emphy and let it get erect
