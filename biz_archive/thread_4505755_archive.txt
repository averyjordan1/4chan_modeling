At what point will /biz/ stop talking about link?
After some point a shitcoin fades into obscurity.
Are we at that point yet?
In my limited time here Ive only experienced the hype of ant shares and link.
NEO got me off the ground and link was supposed to get me out of NEETdom.
Now there is no hope.
Give me hope again biz or I'll be back on /pol/
It's official then.
A link post gets buried without a reply.
RIP
