>Bitfinex is running a tether ponzi/scam to prop up BTC>Printed tether out thin air for pump from 3k up to 8.5k >The crypto community is in total denialThis is frustrating as fuck.
Why are human beings such stupid cattle when everything is about to collapse?
FUCK OFF NSA
Well Anon if you just don't invest in crypto, wouldn't have a problem.
when they are so deluded they think any original thought not 100% aligned with their interest is a government conspiracy
they will never learn OP
Dude, these tether fucks actually think bitfinex is leveraging 20m tether on their own exchange at 100x They also think bitfinex wash trades on their own exchange to the tune of 650m a day, when that's more than their usdt/btc pair sees in 24h volume
No proof faggot.
Fucking conspiratards
The absolute state of /biz/ retards who believe anything they readhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/#marketsbitfinex isnt even top 5 in USDT volume and it only has a 35 mill USD volume WHICH IS NOTHING in compared to the btc marketcap
Compare that to bcash which was given for free but magically has a $20 billion market cap now.
I wonder if an injection of $20 billion out of thin air into the crypto economy would have an influence on Bitcoin prices.. it's a mystery.
implying coinmarketcap is accurateDo you honestly think they're not getting a piece of the pie?
leverage.
look up how banks basically fucked up the world in 2008
All those exchanges are at risk because they use Tether.
This won't stop at Bitfinex.
