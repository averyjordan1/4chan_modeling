I have been noticing quite decent fluctuations recently in DNT.
What do you guys think about district0x ($DNT) for long-term investment?
Teeka is buying this
There are better coins out there, and ED already exists.
Not sure what another DEX would do, since there are thousands of them already.
The developers even said & acknowledged that DNT was insanely overpriced in a YouTube video.
I've bought 0x instead.
But I did have a look at DNT too.District 9 was such a fucking awesome movie
I heard about PBC and Teeka showing interest in it and calling it next big thing.
Not sure how legitimate it was
