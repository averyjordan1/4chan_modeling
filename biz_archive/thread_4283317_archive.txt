Yeah this one really looks like a winner to me and nobody is even talking about it here.
Might have actually caught this early.
I see only green flags for the fundamentals which is pretty rare so I don't care if it bounces around on it's way up.
OP needs patience and research.
>simple yet fascinating business modelThis too.
I can explain it in like 5 minutes to somebody that has no idea what a crypto even is and it solves a real problem.
Blockchain was made for this kind of thing and it is incredibly useful here, these are early adopters of the tech.
I'm excited for 2018.
Project looks promising.
But before I do further research - are there burning or staking functions?
>tfw accumulating on coss
nobody is even talking about it hereSomeone shilled it on here back when it was at .80 or so.
Then there were some fomo/fud threads when it peaked for a bit a few days later.
The BTC fork that never was caused everyone to forget about it for a while.
I'm already up $3k and am not selling any time soon.
Way to buy ATH.
glad I dumped this and went all in Raiden ATH
