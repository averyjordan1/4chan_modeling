You had your fun with multiple threads the past 2 days now fuck off back to your 3 retweet twitter account
Seems like anti-bitfinex side of the argument is ReQing the pro-bitfinex side

The bitfinexed guy.
Sometimes he just stutters and repeats his main point over again.Tether is sketchy, but I don't feel sold on the implosion narrative yet.Also the shilling has been incessant and that makes me skeptical too.
what do I ask my barber if I want the "Tone Vays" look?
jesus christ this is hilarious
Ok guys, who does flibbr work for: bitfinex or tether?
Agreed
trick question: bitfinex and tether are the same company lol
Bitfinexd guy is a stuttering pot head.
even stuttering potheads are right 420 times a day
Pro Tether/Bitfinex guy was shady as fuck and used awful arguments knowingly and desperately such as "people use tether so they trust tether, that's proof that it's legit ("how can so many people be wrong?")".
This is another huge red flag.
They could have avoided this shitstorm at any time they wanted to by revealing their supposed bank account, but they always refuse to.If someone refuses to exonerate themselves when it would be easy if they weren't guilty and they are losing credibility and business due to people doubting them, it's a pretty sure sign that they are guilty.
