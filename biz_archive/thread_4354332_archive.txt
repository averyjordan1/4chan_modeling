What happened to MER?
I HAD 4000 POWR AND I FUCKING SOLD THEM AT A LOSS FOR BCH NOW ITS UP AGAIN AHHHHHHHH
% gains
Yeah I'm out for now.
Maybe I'll be wrong and it'll shoot higher.
But it's already pretty high considering how early on it is for the project.
2x since I went in so no need to be greedy.
Might buy back in if/when it drops back to the mid 2k region.
every bitch listing everywhare, but not link and req , y y yy yyyyyyyyyy
I want to die.
Yes the price is already inflated on trex compared to binance.

I really think it's about to do what MER did
Why?
