I'm the one who predicted the Mercury (MER) moon a while back, the Blocktix (TIX) moon a couple days before it happened as well as the Vibrate (VIB) moon that just happened.
Metal doesn't exactly have anything special going on atm, but it is times like this that you should buy.
Don't concern yourself with what tech is shit if you're just in it to cash in on a moon and exit.
sure you did mr non tripcode fag

Believe me or not.
You're probably one of the peasants that didn't listen to me when I told you to get on MER, VIB, and TiX.
I'm never selling MTL>wolfofpolo.jpg

How are you making these predictions O_O Is there some secret pattern my noob brain can't perceive yet?
whales are accumulating Look at the chart and volume with literally no price action going on
Ohhhhh
Sitting on 450, bags are heavy as fuck.
Waiting to dump this shitcoin, had my chance at $12 and blew it.
does seem to have something going on
I posted about this one too.
I hit my sell order on the 20th, and I've been meaning to get back in.
Just moved VTC over to MTL.
I hope I can catch this one and then move back to VTC before it goes nuts.
