I feel the rumble as the combustion sequence commences.
Fuel, surging through the hull's sturdy pipes, rattles my body as I strap my chest in tighter.
First, a flicker.
An invisibly small spark of heat, but it's all it takes before my ears are split by an earth-shattering roar.
A mighty, fierce roar - a roar that screams the sound of human achievement.
A roar that pierces through the crowd of awestruck onlookers, desperate to catch a glimpse of the mighty titan before them; barely comprehending, for fleeting moments, how it must feel to be onboard.
They're imagining what it is to be a pioneer, a frontiersman; a pathfinder.As our very cores are pressed harder and harder into our seats, I open my eyes - and realise for the first time that we are airborne.
Hurtling, launching; trailblazing into the sky with ferocious power.
Around me, all lights are green - dashboards are flashing, the ecstatic screams of the launch crew are blaring into my ear - but I see only one thing.I see us.
From a million miles above, soaring into the heavens, spiraling into unknown heights.
From here I see the glow we leave behind us, dimly illuminating a world that was just too late.
A globe left behind, the last glimmer of hope fading before them.
As we break orbit, our fire ceases to warm the atmosphere - but its echoes are present; circling the stratospheric haze like a grieving mother with a lamp.
I am sad, sad for the ocean of red below me.
But I hold.
Steadfast, always onwards; I gaze into the vast, infinite expanse before me.
I look to my brothers onboard beside me, and they look at me.
We've made it.What will you be when this happens, /biz/?
On the ground, or in the heavens?
I'll tell you to take your useless meme-ing to reddit :))))))
