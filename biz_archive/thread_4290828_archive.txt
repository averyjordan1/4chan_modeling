Welp, it's up to 916USD again from 886USD.This is so stressful.
I hate speculating on these currency-only coins where the whims of the whales and the biggest dick players is what creates reality, with no fundamental utility/value in the coins that decide whether they are truly priced in or not.
SELL NOW, then buy BitCrystals as fast as you can
