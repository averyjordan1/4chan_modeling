Sell at loss the second the b2x fork happens .. so smart.Whether it happens or not people are holding for it.
Money goes into alts.
REQ has huge upside potential due to low market cap.This isn't difficult.
I wish REQ had such cool memes.
REQ fud is too boring.
Oh my god shut the fuck up.Here's a little thought experiment for ya:It's November, 2018.
What's the current value of Request?Do you REALLY think it'll be the same as now, or lower??
Clearly Lower.
They have to fake 2 years of developing, because their tokens are locked for that period.
After that goodbye
that's applicable to all ICOs, retard
He is starting to understand the ICO bubble
ICO bubble Doesn't mean you can't make money.
point for you, but not on this shitcoin (except day trading)
The classic /biz/ method.
Buy high, sell low.
Normally you'd be right, but btc is a special case.
It's practically a sure thing that it's going to keep going up for a while.
Every time it crashes and people start saying the bubble is finished, it blows everyone away and makes a new ATH.This bubble is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and probably the only safe bet you'll ever have.
Just dump them already kek
