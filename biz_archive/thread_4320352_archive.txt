only true value of btc was being irreplaceable reference point for all the cryptothats why no one cared about fees and transactions and kept expensive and ineffective army of minersif it can be replaced by an altcoin with same functionality and name that only means this altcoin will be replaced even faster with something betterbch will never be the true king because there will be no monarchy2018 will be the year of alts
I member that, read the whitepaper in 2010, it said "This will be an irreplaceable reference point for all crypto".pepperide farm
this, I'm sitting comfy in tethereum and if btc dies, I'm going on a shopping spree in the altcoinmarketbch is just trash with no future, a prasaite that won't survive without btc
Yup.
One flippening greatly increases the chances of more flippenings.Unless you're already BTC rich you should be cheering this on.
The crazy volatility could make your altcoin of choice the next BTC, if only for awhile.
Well said OP.
Everyone knows BTC is a heap of shit technologically, as is BCH.
If BTC loses it's status as "digital gold" then it will have no value whatsoever.If the flippening happens, then 2018 will be the year of XMR and ETH.
That is exactly why I am all in in alts.
