All memes aside, would this be a good entry point for LINK?
It seems like it's reached its floor.
get in here.
Reminder there are two aryan coons, one is mooning.
somewhere below ico
2000 is the best entry point
What are you referring to?
it won't dip below 0.150 anymore, Id wait for it to dip to 0.160, depending on how much youre putting into it.
If it isnt much, go for it rn
 cent seemed to be the floor in the last dips, if the pattern repeats and the bots haven't changed their basic behaviour I think it might dip a bit more
.15 usd from there goes to .20 and then back to 0.15 every week
