Hey guys I am making a List of bitcoin forks for the people that have old wallets to split our currencies during the coin transition.
Let me know if I am missing anything or if I am wrong in my list or if anyone has a reliable source with a good list of all forks we can split our coins into.
Please keep this post up to help each other in this time of transition.
So far I have:Bitcoin XT - January 1, 2016Bitcoin Unlimited - May 17, 2017Bitcoin Cash - August 1, 2017Bitcoin Gold - October 23, 2017
all fuds attempts to later buy low
Bitcoin Forks True but we may all be holding some and not even know it.
Might as well take them.
It seems I may have been wrong, the only one that has coins that can be claimed is Bitcoin Cash.Bitcoin gold is still not claimable for some reason.
WTF.
This is OP don't know why my ID changed.
Bitcoin XT - January 1, 2016>Bitcoin Unlimited - May 17, 2017These never forked.
Was it integrated into the main bitcoin client and not considered a fork but an upgrade or were they killed off?
>Bitcoin XT - January 1, 2016>Bitcoin Unlimited - May 17, 2017these never made new coins.
all coin splits are from hard forks, but not all hard forks result in coin splits.
also bitcoin gold blockchain is going live tomorrow (12/11/17), thats why they havent been "claimable" yet.
So correcting my OP the only two "coin splits" were:Bitcoin Cash - August 1, 2017 (redeemable since August).Bitcoin Gold - October 23, 2017 (redeemable November 12, 2017).
So November 12, should we expect a bigger bitcoin price dip?
One would think that the price of BTG will tank as soon as people can actually get their coins and deposit them to sell them on an exchange.The current BTG price is a bit artifical right now since it's basically just Binance that gave people their BTG and don't allow withdrawals or deposits yet.
There will be much confusing between people thinking Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold thinking it is the same thing.
