Why the hell is this pumping so hard?
Especially after I sold half mine for alts.
Vitalik was caught fucking a child
sold half mineanswered your own question anon
BTC is settling down and ETH is returning to its market share at 0.06
novel approach anon, you are saying ETH is not only resistant to the increasing market dilution of 1000 new shitcoins per day but in fact draws power from this?
literally big if true

that's fine but doesn't account for leakage to shitcoins, for example right now combined 70% share down from 90% at the start of the year
I'm not sure what you're trying to say, bitcoin is a shitcoin, hopefully we get a flippening before crypto grows too huge
Purely talking about % share, more and more shitty 'little' million dollar coins chipping away, but once they reach a certain level their abilities grow a ton.
Yes it is easier to move a coin 3x from 10 - 30 million, but look at something like BCH which fucking appeared and ate 20 billion
You do know what a market cap is dont you anon?
Nobody spent $20bill the total value of all coins sold at the market rate was $31 bill.
Daily volume and tx per day are the only metric worth looking at desu
I do know what it is, but i actually don't even know why the fuck i brought this up, have completely forgotten whatever point it was i was going to make and for this i apologize faggots
