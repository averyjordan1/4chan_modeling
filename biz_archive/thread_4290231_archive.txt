Alright guys, I'm done with this BTC/BCH shit, I don't want all my crypto gains wiped out due to some bullshit between the miners/devs/Chinese whales/whatever.
So fuck those coins for the time being.I want to move my btc holdings into something less volatile while the dust settles.
Currently on the fence between:ETHXMRLTCVTCNEOLSKWhat do you guys think is the best short-mid term hodl out of these?
If you shill some other shitcoin I hope your investment Batista Bombs and you fuck off so don't try that shit.
n-no ark s-senpai?
SALT barely moved today
I'm holding ARK friend but I'm not going all in just now
xmr looks really good right now, thats what i will be buying
ETH, NEO and XMR are the only good coins there
I just split my btc stack in half to eth.
calm down you dingus.
BCH will return to shitcoin status within the week.
It's clearly a pump and dump with most of the volume coming form a single exchange in korea.
BTC will be hitting 8k by year's end.
I feel the same way anon.
I just want this Bitcoin drama to end.
BCC really opened Pandora's box and now we have this shit.
Out of your picks I'd say XMR is the clear winner.
Better be 10 kBecause this shit disgusted a lot of people who poured shekels into crypto
implying that lsk is bad and inferior to NEO
I made a bit this morning on the fuck your mother coin gravy train and immediately dumped it for more SALT and RLC.
Never knew love like this before
All in NEO baby, collecting that sweet GAS for when it moons
Ya, go with the coin that's had 150mill frozen and the coin that has pumped.Don't go with ltc that's the only one that's been stable this whole time.Stay poor.
XMR feels great long term, just a little salty cause I almost bought in a few days ago but its gone up like 15-20% since then
ETH and XMR are my favourite long termbut short term has to be LSK with their rebrand and SDK release within the next months.
Buy small amount of sonm, check it in couple of month.
