Lending icos are the new gold era of icos, just made 130k off 3600
please explain for poorfag
GRX is around 5 or 6 right now, much better to get in on that one than this
These are the same icos as bitconnect and only growing, check out coinlendinglist.weebly.comRegalcoin x70Hextracoin x30Goldreward x10Scam icos are the new big thing
You can get Regalcoin by buying and staking.
To buy Regalcoin can be done through exchangers who have worked with us.Literal pajeet-tier website lmao
Money is money, get in and get out.
Or would you rather have a 'legit' ico like confido and still get your asses scammed
Who gives a fuck.
I'm up over 10,000% through lending platforms.
I finally have 6 figures
Made a huge amount from regal.
The only decent lending platform that has staying power imo is GRX because it doesn't have millions of affiliate levels like the other scams.
Which means it's more likely to stay alive for longer.
Should pull a REGAL/Hextra.
Prob $50 within next 60 days.
dont get how it works
These lending release their coins in batches so you have a chance to buy a limited amount everytime.
It's hard to get but depending on the difficulty the value goes up 10-30x.
You can either choose to lend if u trust the company or just hold and sell after which is what I do.
They are all ponzi schemes so just make sure u exit after a while.
Ucoincash.co is the next big one guaranteed ATLEAST 10x out the door bc of hype and how hard the coins are to get
Thx kind stranger!
