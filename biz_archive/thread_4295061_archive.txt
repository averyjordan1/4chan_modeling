What's the best method for finding coins that are overbought / oversold based on RSI levels?
Using a daily or 4 hr chart will give you the best overbought/oversold levels.
Use with stochastics crossover to confirm a shift in trend.
30-60 for bear periods 40-80 for bullruns.
I understand that, but is there a fast method of finding coins that have these levels?
Or do I have to manually search each coin on tradingview.
That was my question
ask your rabbi.
