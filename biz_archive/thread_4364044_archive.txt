If I set a big sell order below the current price, will EtherDelta only sell at the price I listed, or will it also clear the order book above my sell price
Try it and see
each sell is individual.
it will only clear your order.
You mean below the current bid I guess.It doesn't have automatic ordermatching, so It will only sell at the price listed.
