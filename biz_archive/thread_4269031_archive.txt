Is there any reason Stellars market cap should be any lower than Ripples at this point?
nope.
Hope you are buying while its cheap.
Absolutely no reason.
People saying otherwise have probably not read the AMA.
funny how stellar shills STFU when price goes down and when its up they come crawling out of the woodwork againpathetic
So do you not like Lumens and if not why?
