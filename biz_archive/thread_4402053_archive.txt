Looks like they BTFO zksnarks?
Is this an in-house effort?How does it relate to REQt?
Yes it's in house.
No it has no relation to REQ at all.No it's not that they BTFO zksnarks.
It's just that they found a much less computationally expensive way of proving what they want most of the time (basically like: 'is your salary <$30000' yes/no).
zksnarks will still be used for other things where they actually need the exact salary figure for taxes, etc.
