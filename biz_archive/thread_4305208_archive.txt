I just bought 10k LINK.
Did I fuck up /biz?
RIP
Not if you're cool with holding until June
What happens in june?
There might not be any news for like 2 years.
Mentally prepare yourself for the possibility of carrying immense bags.
I am find with holding however long it takes for me to make it to the moondo you think 10k LINK is enough to make it to the moon.
I don't mind waiting
Maybe dude who the fuck knows this is crypto.
Not at these prices, you're almost at ICO prices.
Store it away and check on it next year.
nothing he just pulled that month out of his ass
hurr durr it'll take 2 years for the coin to moon.
i pulled this number out of my ass too
EOY will be around $1.5-3.
JUNE 2018 it will be at least $75.
Patience is key.
im holding 10k LINK because the idea of biztards making it with this shitcoin is hilarious to me, and on the off chance it happens I want to be part of it
?
Where the f have you pulled that number from?
I'm pro-LINK but I don't think it's hitting 75 next near
just hitting $10 would be amazing.
Short term: you fucked upLong term: best decision you ever made
Agreed.
ima pick up a fuckload of link around dec-jan, just doesnt make sense now
