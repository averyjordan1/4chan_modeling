TA doesn't really "work" anywhere, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy involving a bunch of people who are all trained to recognize the same patterns and manipulate the size of the candles to suit those patterns, who share their TA with other people and then everyone buys/sells based on the same patterns.
TA only works if you can spread it far enough, so it's essentially just one big pump and dump.
