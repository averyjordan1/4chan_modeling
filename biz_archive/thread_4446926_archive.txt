Be honest with me.
mid 2018
yes
mid 2019
Yes, but you need to pick the right coins and be patient.
This.
Industry adoption hasn't even properly begun yet
Not so fast.Best case scenario is a BTC and cryptos crash after the Tether scandal and then you're on your own, but then you know the potential of the market.
lol, Bitcoin won't crash because one borderline psychotic Twitter user has personal issues with Bitfinex.
Worst case scenario Tether use is discarded, Bitcoin growth rate gets cut in half plus the occasional dip, and that's it.
Why "mid 2018" pls explain, what happens in mid 2018 that won't happen in say...january 2018?
Or next month?one borderline psychotic Twitter user has personal issues with Bitfinexhonest kek
another crash and 2 years after that
All my alts are doing great.
This past month I'm up quite a bit... you have to pick the right ones, as more come to market it'll get to the point where only the better ones will go up.
crypto is beyond fucked ay this point, btc wont survive and it will crash crypto with it
