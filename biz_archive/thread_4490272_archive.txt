Holding LINK since ICO.Thinking about selling at 40% loss.Tell me why i should/shouldnt do it
look at fiat value
I did last week and it was the best decision I made in a long time.
Wish I did it sooner.
>Tell me why i shouldSo you can jump on other potential pumps and make ur money back (or probably lose even more)>shouldnt do itin case LINK suddenly releases the update everyone is waiting for and it takes off./thread
Idiot
What?
If you got in at ICO how can you be at a loss?
The ICO price was around 0.00035 ETH.
It never went below that.
GTFO.
he cares about USD valuekys boomer
You didn't sell @ 10k SAT?
But it’s not below ICO value even in ETH is it?
What was it 0.007 ETH?
Or 0.0007?
I can’t rmeember.
Pretty sure it’s not below in BTC or ETH value
i'm in the same boat.
maybe sell 50% so if it does moon suddenly you're still in.
the changes are it'll go lower, since they recently admitted the network is done in another language due to scaling problems.
rory also mentioned some other "difficulties arising".
