Tell me if my plan is valid.> open a business in Bulgaria> operate 100% online> generate $1M in one year> pay corporate income tax of 10%The company now has $900k on its bank account.Am I free to then move in whatever country (lets sqy Thailand), live there for 1 year, take the money from the company as dividends, and pay the dividend tax (to Bulgaria) and the income tax to the country I'll be living in (Thailand).
It's going to be a pain in the ass to receive money from your business if you still work from your home in thailand because to work from your home in thailand you will need a work permit or you will be jailed.
Srs.
allright so lets say I live in a EU cuntry with low income tax
>(Thailand).lol every virgin with a little money immediately goes to thailand for cheap hookers.
I took it as an example, if I were to to Asia it would be more Cambodge.
