NULS has been good to me this far, jumped out of it for BCH in time too.
Moved back in @ 0,0001 after more details surfaced about the Inchain connection, we'll probably see more hype around the project when it's talked about by bigger news outlets and a more polished website is published.
Figure there's not many of us who recognize the profit that's to be made here yet as these threads are pretty much dead on arrival.pic related, altcoin market cap looks like it will do another leg up in the next weeks - probably not only BCH that will gain
I thought I was alone here for a second lol.
