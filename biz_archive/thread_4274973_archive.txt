Why do people say they "trade" like its an activity that takes up their time?
it takes just a few seconds to make a trade.
do they seriously sit there and wait in between trades?
i stare at charts all day mostly cuz i like making money
Most of its research and TA to find an appropriate buy in.
Will watch like a hawk if it does something irregular.
If you are taking just a few seconds to make a trade you are going to make absolutely horrible trades.
Stay poor.
Those people are mostly neets and virgin traders that pray for money to fix their autism.
It bassically is the "gamer" of trading.The fact that you can get in with a few hundreds created this neet-trading-delusion.
Strange timeline indeed.
