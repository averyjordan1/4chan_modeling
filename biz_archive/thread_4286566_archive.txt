You have been warned.
WHATS GOING ON WTFim considering to go all in on chainlink now.
Is 5K usd enough to make it?
You don’t have to go all in.
I am, but you can’t go all in and panic sell if it drops a couple cents before the moon.
I really have a feeling about today.
REQ said they were in active talks for a deeper partnership with link similar to Link/SWIFT.
Look it up and DYOR BEFORE YOU THROW ALL YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING YOU DONT UNDERSTAND.
