Doubtful.
Teeka only shills things he can P&D.
He's not strong enough to pump BAT.
this is 100% in the PBC report.
Its not the main pick tho, Dash is
Huh, well okay.
That's interesting.
I'm happy if BAT pumps since I bought some at @2100 and still holding lol
Those are the picks of the previous months, Don't risk.
BAT is the only shitcoin that dumps when they release good news
it's going up :O
