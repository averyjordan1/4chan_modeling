If I still need to explain you what this project is I'll wonder if you were in a coma the last weeks.Dipping time is over my friends.
Weak hands were shaken out and it is already back on track.
The Fomo increases.
as well as the Volume.
You know what will come next.To all my RLC buddies: strap on your belts very tightly because we will not go to the moon.
We will see each other in the fucking Andromeda galaxy.
Protip: Listen to epic music while taking off.
I find it really funny, that my whole portfolio is in the reds again, except RLC with a steady 16% rise.
People finally aknowledging this gem.
RLC guiding the gains with all its green
wooo im going all in.
gotta get out of BTC its crashing hard right now
The sky is the limit!
this level of shilling makes me sad, please buddy.
if it goes up it goes up
How soon till we hit 100mill?
This gem doesnt need shilling.
Unironically it has one of the best chances to survive upcoming crypto crash and create something that will be valued in many industries
This ship has sailed, RLC is done, obviously
