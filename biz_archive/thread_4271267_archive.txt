Vertcoin is alright
Want to have a daily and steady income without the trading risks?
you should think about investing in the Diamond (DMD).
look at the daily earnings of the owner DMD masternodes.pro/stats/dmd
In any order in particular?
Not bad overall, but definitely look into Komodo (KMD) if you haven't already
Nah, no order.
Pretty equal in all of them.
Kinda just a mix of projects I thought looked cool and projects I thought would be hyped short term
RLC is a good one to be honest
iexec (rlc) might give you the most gains
Whats up with VTC?
Bought at 68k sats, do I hold onto it for a while?
