People ask - Anon, how are you so sure about this shitcoin.I tell you this.
I knew WTC was going to be successful from the start.
Everything was pointing in that direction.
That coin went from $1 to $8 in 3 weeks!
People were still fudding all over the internet.
Saying the CEO's from videos were nothing else but actors.
Have you made money?
Fucking great, that's what this is all about!Look at Link, such a hype from the start, everyone going fucking mental about.
Probably because of Swift, but that was never confirmed.
Team of two guys, who have now gone quiet.
Is it because there is no product?
Is it because there is no involvement from Swift?
No one knows, but people are still talking about it and want to get in.Nuls is another one of those projects.
Nothing is certain, no news about the Devs, shitty white paper but there is the idea!
And its a fucking good one for sure.
Whether all this spectacle is planned, or not, it's still about making money.
So let's be honest, no one cares about the project.
No one is legally bonded and most will split as soon as they make the profit!
But how much are you going to make?
How much is enough?You are now in front of a opportunity of making money my friend.
Don't fucking waste it, get in and I promise you that you will hear from me again about other worthy projects (or at least about those that will make you money).Yours, Anon
Totally agreed.
Iâ€™m in since Saturday and already making profits.
To the moon!
