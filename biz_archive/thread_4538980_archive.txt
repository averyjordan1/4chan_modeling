All the fudders, please do you job well.
Need this thing to dump so that I can accumulate more.
Same anon fudding in every thread.Whats your buy order at buddy?
you seem nervous it might not hit
This shit is dumping on both Etherdelta and Binance.
FFS the "pump" couldnt even come close to ICO price.
What fuckin chart are you watching?There's over 100 ETH buy walls on binance right now
This pajeet is sore because he sold his coins two days ago at a 30% discount.
The entire wall is just 1 whale order tho
well then its a 300 eth wall if its 1 whale
This is not truw, been watching it grow and grow.
Yes it was 1 whale, its been taken away now - price is heading further down.
Enjoy those bags.
> going to moonyou fucking assholes made me jump into this
Looks like a head and shoulders forming as well.
I'd be cautious.
Honestly what is the future outlook of this currency in mid term and long term?
Price going even lower - do you think we will get a new all time low this weekend?
This.
Every time there is good new, REQ goes down.
Good news kills crypto If they posted a pic of a food truck with a REQ logo in it though this thing would go to Pluto
haha!
they should just skateboard around town talking photos outside McDonalds, their local istore and some banks.
