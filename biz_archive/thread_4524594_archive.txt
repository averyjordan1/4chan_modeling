Any crypto charts to follow?I've been swing trading NEO and LTC mainly because I'm used to the patterns, and not to mention its quite volatile and high volume in most days.However, i need another crypto to watch.
Something with high volume, non-pajeet coin, preferably on bittrex and binance; something that's nice for swing trades (1-7 days hold at most).I'm looking at ZEN and SYS atm
