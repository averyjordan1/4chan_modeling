I intend to work with a forklift but my body is in sort of a bad condition.
What exactly do I need to do and how exhausting is it.
You need to push levers so the forks can move.
You might have to hit a gas pedal to make it go forward.
Look at this very good educational video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z77oztO6UQ
OP, listen to this guy, he has forklift experience.As another forklift-fag, I'll add that you might need to sit in a chair, and sometimes even flick a switch.
How have no one mentioned the amount of turning your body sideways so you can see behind you
Sometimes you have to lift heavy propane tanks, if it’s a gas-powered forklift like the one in your picture.
But if you’re really weak you might be able to get someone to do it for you
4358374Can confirm both are true, I'd also add that you sometimes have to wear a safety hat.
Staplerfahrer Klaus, all you need to know.
I have never seen a forklift driver wear a safety hat, and I have worked in multiple factories and warehouses.

!Everybody wears a Helm!!!!
Was working as a forklift operator in a big car headlight factorySo question, will you operate the "outside" forklift like on the pic with the cab and 4 wheels, or will you operate the "warehouse" type which is open and idioticNot a tough job kinda, but i had an accident where a forklift slipped on some water and crushed my left foot, was lucky af only the meat was squished and no bone broken (doctor said it missed my ankle by a few mm's)Just today i was called that i was hired as a forklift operator in a food factory, this will be interesting but i dont look forward to it at all cause minimal wage
