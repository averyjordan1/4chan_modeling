so take out a loan, pay back with another bigger loan, take out yet another loan on that loan ect and so on for years to build up your credit then take a massive loan towards the end of your life and claim bankruptcy and go travel the world while retired, never pay the loan back and fuck a bunch of thai ladyboys?
