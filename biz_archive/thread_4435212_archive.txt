Is it good time to buy Neo or should I wait longer ?
buy the dips
Hell yes it is.
There is a wall at 0.05 BTC.
This is the dippiest of dips.
Anyone who did their research is waiting for the announcement in the next few days and is definitely buying in at 0.05.
Tonight's pullback is probably the last chance to get in at a good price.
NEO mooned already.
It may falltime to buy LRC
Time to buy ETH
going to be a bigger dip if that announcement isn't EEA tier
