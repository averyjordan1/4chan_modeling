that feeling of regret is your small amount of intelligence desperately trying to break through your LINKie delusion.
post something FOMOIt's still largely an idea but it has strong financial and industry backing so it should become a reality in a year or so.
don't sell son, don't be a sinner.
Mein kamerad, be Panzer, nicht mouse.
NEIN FEAR
I am trying not to lolEvery fomo post is of great help, even memes , keep them coming!
I wanted to fomo into BCH and then go back to link after fork with more gains hopefully btw
if you want to educate yourself and gain condidence back with great examples and explanations and lots of good links to do your reserach please check this link out https://pastebin.com/6xcsc2jR
It's funny how I put in 5% of the monetary value I pumped in LINK into Confido and now have the same amount of worth for both tokens.I still believe in LINK but thanks for the anti-burn Confido
should have waited a bit imo to maximize your profits
literally everyone who wants a secure connection to the blockchains will use LINK.LITERALLY EVERYONE IN A MARKET THAT KEEPS ON GROWING EVERY FUCKING YEAR.>literally 11k Banks and every Insurance Business will use it>literally every smart contract on the planet will use it
this must be a larp right?
how fucking stupid is /biz/
It is fucking idea.Will you ever get it.Sergay can start it over with financial institutions, without making bunch of marines filthy rich.
