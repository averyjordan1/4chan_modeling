Anyone have experience with AvaTrade?
They give a bonus of up to $10k for signing up.
Put in $1k get $350 for free.
They trade stocks, commodies, cryptocurrencies, fully regulated.
What do you guys think of putting money, buying BTC, and then sending it to your wallet for free money?
Is there something I'm missing here?
