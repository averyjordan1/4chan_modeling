Anyone else feel like altcoins are going to have a giant pump in the first to Qs of 2018 just like they did in 2017.
I mean 2017 February to July was nuts for alts, will it happen again?
And what’s your opinion on the alt coin to watch for that period.
I’m going with aeternity or civic.
Your thoughts?
No shilling fudding please
Some coins are in the dark when it comes to the general public.
Large pumps will catapult those coins to 2x-10x their market cap.
So yes, big moons coming in 2018.
Most investors are unaware when it comes to good projects.
Hype moves the market right now
Yes, especially Chancoin.

Yeah should be tons of hype to if that janitor thing appears on Coinbase.
Massive pumps will happen.
I’m just going to make sure to not fuck myself over and buy bitcoin before it explodes again when alts rise back.
I lost thousands by not buying bitcoin.
