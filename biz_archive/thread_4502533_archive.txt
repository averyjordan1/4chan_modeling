It can't keep going down forever, just until it gets to enough buy orders, which I think it has
It can easily go down to $32, but I hope you're right.
Ofcourse its rising, the news was actually pretty solid.
Just extremely overhyped explaining the dip.

The key info from their apology today: they don’t expect a change in regulations to fit Neo, they are developing Neo to meet existing regulations.
In other words they don’t need the ICO ban removed if they can provide a platform for blockchain based securities offerings.
lol neo, it'll be back to $0.50 in a couple weeks
dumb to buy NEO.
They have shit team.Some holders think that they will moon on Q1 2018 with NEO.
Bullshit, that team is a buch of amatuer developers.NEO will be 20$ next month.
i feel pity with you cucks that chase pump to pump.
I'll let you earn some DGB once you are desperate enough to put some sharpies in your pooper.
i sold all my neo when I found out it has no real use and is a shit coin.
I will buy it at its previous floor.
What about becoming the one and only cryptocurrency for the chinese?Probably won't be NEO, but whatever it is, you know it'll happen.
It'll cement China as THE major player in cryptocurrency.
