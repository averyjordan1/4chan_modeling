If that's the case go invest in FoldingCoin or CureCoin
JesusCoin, DGB, SC, DOGE, PINKCOIN i would just park it all amongs these and feel very comfy a year from now
Non-troll answer: BTC and ETH, LTC if you want to ride the coattails of BTC, XMR if you believe normies will be more concerned about privacy, LINK and most other altcoins if you're a pajeet memer.
