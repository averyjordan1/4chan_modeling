I've been getting everything right with this chart for the last 2 dayshttps://www.tradingview.com/chart/BCHUSD/PEf43Ts0-BCH-to-1500/
nice call, i think it will touch $1500 as well.
no idea what happens after that
Weird, I'm actually getting around the same number except I'm guestimating with ichimoku clouds.
It could go up or it could go down
Compare to btc chart and then you will know.
im just lettin it ride mang
its going to 0.2 sats again, iusnt itand I didnt fucking buy godammit fuck this pump scam
it's friday and the gooks on bithumb have put 1.6billion into it in the past 24hours.
$1500 sounds too low, too underwhelming.
Dangerous to daytrade this coin.
might stay at that price
It will stick to that dotted line - what it does after is up to the gods
Why?
Explain
i'm sorry to inform you that you have schizophrenia

i can feel it.
Actually it could become a straight up bull market after today4421821
It's gonna have to break around 0.266 within a few hours or around 0.25 within a day or so for us to be running with the bulls again
