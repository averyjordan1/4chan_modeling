Ethereum would have been noticed as most undervalued coin if it were not for last two incidents.
ETH became a set foundation for lot of derivative companies as well as well established currency in trading other ALTs yet it's still under $350 while BCH and DASH exceeds $350 far more eventhough it has not planted itself as a main currency for trade.Will ETH be able to recover its brand after this 3rd incident of their flawed platform?
