You don't buy BCH on Bitmex, you are buying futures that are based in bitcoin.
So just buy straight BCH and lose all your money the old fashioned way.
Bitmex doesn't suck.
You're just a clueless faggot

It's to make you change your mind and trade off more of your money, like a casino
fuck that actually makes a lot of sense
