2k to spare what to go all in on for quickest gains?
Thinking nulls or mod which will moon faster
POWR no contest
raw bacon
nuls for sure
That's Korean BBQ you dumb negroid amerifat
Iâ€™m 90% in Nuls.
I think now is a good entry point.
Pick up a masternode if you can.
how much for masternode i dont see any info on it.
MODbut 1k in POWR might get you retired in 5 years.
For now its 10,000.
Might change later.
Nuls, just bought around 8500
when will they be active, roadmap says 1-2 years
Bitcoin Cash
All these idiots saying nuls, which makes it a shitcoin.
MOD is clearly tightening up to moon.
there's a working product, and it pays a dividend.
Customers don't need to buy tokens on some shitty exchange just to use the product.
dont look at BlockMason
I don't understand these depth charts, mind explaining to me?
thanks, i shuffled around to get 5k NULS..masternode coins are going to be hawt shit next year.. thanks, Dash.
Doesn't Publica get distributed to ICO buyers sometime this week?
Might wanna get that when it does
