You're being played by a whale right now.
Look at that one year downtrend.
Look at the previous recoveries.
What makes you think this will be different?
It isn't even at last week's price yet.
Ark has recovered it's losses for the month and is back at it's support line.
iExec is just going to bleed out forever, continuing soon with the next leg down to 6k from the last ATL.
That trend is too strong to reverse now.Enjoy.
So... sell?
>implying trends matter
> makes you thinkthe fud on iexec has been relentless these last few weeks.
the arrival of the whales seems to have coincided with the browbeating.
if you're going to freak out at the yearly, daily, or three daily chart, whatever - take a look at the SMI.
or the moving average.we've been in the under-bought range more or less since september.
sooo what you are are saying is, we should buy?
That one week is an enoooormous cup
This shit better moons soon
to compare value with golem as a bare minimum - it's not impossible that this will surge to the neighbourhood of 32,000 (depending on BTC at the time).
$2.20 seems pretty reasonable, given the relative scarcity of rlcthe rlc investors have been pretty vigilant with pumpers, with good reason, which is a good indication this is as good as a base as you're likely to get.you make the call, but if this becomes part of the ethereum infrastructure, it's value will likely track along some percentage of the ETH marketcap (whether it grows or contracts).
Just 1% of $30,600,000,000 is pretty good.
Even 0.5% is good.
Why?
I hope it doesn't moon personally.
The longer this stays under the radar the better.
Thats an easy answer: Because now the have a running product.
Something golem hasnÂ´t accomplished in twice the time.
iexec is delivering fundamentals!
