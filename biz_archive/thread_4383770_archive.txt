best way to buy small amounts of btc?
i need to buy about 80$ in btc every month because i live in this fucked up country and i need local currency so this month i tried using uphold -> localbitcoins and they took like 10$ from me.
fuck that
bump
also why does uphold has a 0.0007btc 'transaction fee' and localbitcoins has another transaction fee.
are they fucking me over
just buy eth and then trade it.
deals done.
never use bitcoin for anything, you're gonna get ripped off.
they took like 10$ from me.
fucking lol you poor street shitter don't buy BTC if you don't understand the tech and what's even happening when you send one.
Bitcoin isn't for poor.
yea that's what i'm figuring out now.
fucking scam
Bitcoin is only for big investors.
I'm expecting it to crash soon once small investors/people who want to use it as a currency leave it for XMR/ETH/LTC or some other coin they could rally behind that actually isn't garbage.Anyways, just buy ETH/XMR instead
