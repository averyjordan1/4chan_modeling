So I’m putting my wagecuck USD into Coinbase every week.
Should I go 100% BTC, or maybe incorporate some fractions of LTC AND ETH such as:50% BTC25% LTC25% ETHDoesn’t have to be one of these options
Btc eth ltc are safe bets.
Your percentages look fine
add XMR as well.
Its as safe as any of the others youve listed
Go 100% ArkEvery single biz poster is loaded up on arkEveryone knows it’s the only coin that’s ever going to be used IRLso much so that the faggots in the biz delegate come here and FUD it everyday trying to keep the price down
Its a generally good strategy OP.
The proportions in each should just reflect whatever risk level you are comfortable holding at the time.
Since you are dollar cost averaging, it means the strategy itself is the hedge.
Proportions can be changed on the fly based on your future assessments.
Just start somewhere.
I'd suggest putting a sizeable investment in place to start just because the time factor is highly relevant.
Earlier has beaten later in crypto consistently.
