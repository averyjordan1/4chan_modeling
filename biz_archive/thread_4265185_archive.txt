Anyone else get in early and looking forward to using GAS to replace salary?
2018 can't get here fast enough.
What happens in 2018?
whats a reasonable amount of NEO to achieve this?
Shits gonna blow up.
Look at the pipeline.
-3500 depending on GAS price should be about right.
to clarify, what is a salary to you?
K but my expenses only run about 25-30K
Why not just buy gas?
Each Neo will net you less than a whole gas until they stop making gas
NEO never stops generating GAS.
It creates GAS in the beginning but then as the platform gets up and running NEO generates GAS through transaction fees.
>Get in NEO early>Generate mountains of GAS>Use GAS to buy more NEO to generate even more GASFuckin' pottery.
NEO is the COMFIEST coin.
sounds sustainable enjoy your implosion
