What kind of trading has brought you the most success so far?
HODLing bitcoin?
Microtrading LTC or ETH on small dips and highs?
Getting lucky with Alt moons?So far trading shitcoins on Etherdelta has been treating me quite well for large percent gains on small amounts.
And BTC has given me the largest gains since I have most of my money in it.
Buying ETH, ANS, and OMG each made me more gains than hodling BTC this year.
Any tips on how to locate the corrects erc20 token?
I bought something today on a tip, and of course it's down like everything else.
research fundamentals - assess hype and how many bag holders.
if its mooned before - likely to be many bagholders that'll dump on you the second it moves upwards.look for small marketcap icos that have recently closed - or try and get in one.im in a few small mc icos (1M-1.5M) and looking forward to taking gains
Bitcoins.
Buy it.
Come back a few weeks later...$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Find something that has good fundamentals and hold.
ETH and ANS have been particularly rocky.
OMG was a relatively smooth moon mission compared to them.
You literally will not make it if you get fudded easily.
Look at the fucking linkies ffs.
Not saying its a moon mission but if ever it does moon, im sure not a lot of people in 4chan will make it since most probably sold or will sell with no plan of buying back in.
People that get burned by something are less likely to buy back in.
so eth neo omg and ark has bag holders?
once you know the Monero pattern its easy to make a few decent flips a month
 how many bag holders.
if its mooned beforePretty sure that applies to almost every other coin including Bitcoin that isnt a week old at this point.
sure but you must evaluate the cause of death.
eth and ark are suffering from btcitis and neo got hit by the china fud.
if those issues are resolved people who dropped them might be eager to buy back in, which is why they always recover when btc turns off the boosters
btc never does it rockets up all day everyday
$1 ETH august 2015.
Basically every other decision was terrible.
