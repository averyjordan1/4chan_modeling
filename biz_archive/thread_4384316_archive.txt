Hi Guys.

What should I buy?
VERTCOIN BABY, ITS ABOUT TO MOON
Doge
LINK, REQ, HST
POWR http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/10/05/power-ledger-the-aussie-company-thats-using-blockchain-to-digitise-energy_a_23233202/IN B4 FUCK HUFFPO.
It's the best explanation in an article of what POWR does in simple terms.
BITCOIN
Please tell me if Terry has seen that pic.
Buy ven, read about it first though.
They just signed with madeforgoods taking another nice basket of clients onboard.
Damn you all said different things.
I was originally going to do REQ but seems off.
BTC, there was a guy from the future saying it will hit $1,000,000 per coin in 2020 or 2024, I forget, he was posting on 4chan on some other board I forget which one.
Id say Vertcoin but in your case, bitcoin cash
bitcoin cash seems like a lot of hype but not much action unless i'm missing something.
how long would I need to hold it to actually make money?
OMGThen sell one to two months from now, and put it into LINK.
I was looking at IOTA and LISK.
Thoughts?
Or am I better off buying $50 each of 10 different altcoins?
honestly don't think he looks like obama.
he looks way more like kanye west.
Bump.
Will be back in a few hrs.
Don't let me down!
If I become rich I'll return the favour.
RaiBlocks next IOTA
Yes do it, buy high sell low
