Made some money trading POWR yesterday, due to nice momentum in the morning when there was high volume.
I don't have much experience, but what is your prediction for today, if it starts getting that kind of volume again?
GOY power shills in full force
it has dip too many sat friend, but i recommend you enter Vertcoin for many gain!!!!
you can trade the minipumps pretty effectively but it gets more dangerous with every bounce.
set buys for ~5900 and sells around 6400 for ez pz almost guaranteezy gains
Not shilling, just asking, because yesterday was my first time trading and I made some money.. but I'm interested in what people have to say about today.I'm not very experienced, that's why I'm asking someone that is longer in trading, what kind of moves do we expect, given the past few recent days.
