In his last conference at devcon, why does he start calling oracles middleware?What's the difference?
Because he is in he middle whenever Rory and Steve pegs his ass.
Because they [chain]link everything together.
More like vaporware, am I right?
Oracle is a data linkMiddleware is how it's achieved
Nothing because they are.
Chainlink is a decentralized network of oracles that exists off the chain.
Wheh you stake a token you aren't even staking it onchain.
It works similar to an exchange where you sent it Link and your node is credited for it.
Once Link is staked it doesn't matter what blockchain the transaction is on because it credits it offchain and you only actually get it when you withdrawal.
