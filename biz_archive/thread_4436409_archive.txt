How does USDT stay at a steady price when the supply is constant?
WTF is propping up the price.
Is it going to crash eventually?
It will be the next gox.
Bitfinex and tether owned by same company.
Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.
So 1 USDâ‚® is always equivalent to 1 USD.
what exchange carries BCH that isn't Bitfinex?
After their site went down today i'm actively looking for a different exchange
