Insiders moving coin to ETH for faster transactions and to remain less conspicuous rather than trading directly for BCH.
BCH will remain steady before large trades from ETH to BCH happen over the coming days.
Expect large pump in about 2 days.
Correction at 2600.
Same thing will repeat a few days after that.
I made this up.
SIgh.
There should be an IQ filter or something ..
You mean insiders moving from BCH to ETH?
Youre contradicting yourself.
Obvious.
Also, people would ratehr use LTC then ETH to move it, as always when big things happen and ltc price goes up.
instead of BTC - BCH it's BTC-ETH-BCH
sorry for the typo.
I meant to say BTC to ETH and then back to BCH.
