Big Monero (XMR) fan and a software engineer here, so I understand a decent portion of the cryptolingo most of you lemmings can't wrap your head around.I'm not gonna say it's going to MOOON anytime soon, but it's definitely a worthy long-term hold.It has an excellent development team, and a superior hashing algorithm to just about every coin on the market.Why don't you own any?I'll be here to answer any questions I can.
What is you mom like?
bretty gud, doesn't afraid of nothing
Buy up to $80.
already have my 21 M(illion)onero
XMR is my value storage, and i'm eyeballing Aeon for a big pump in Q1/Q2 2018
The Monero team is also working on a system called Kovri, which will effectively replace TOR as a secure, private overlay-network.No other coin network has anything close to as sophisticated in terms of privacy and security.
I also like Aeon as a lightweight version of XMR, we're in early for good times.
