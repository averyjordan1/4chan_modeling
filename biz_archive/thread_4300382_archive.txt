4300401what wallet do you use to store LINK ?
myetherwallet
This.
I'm all for link, even been looking up what all is going to be needed to run a node.
But right now there is no reason to hold it yet.
Once it goes, its gone.
Will liquidate part of my BCH for Link in a little bit.
It is an ERC20 token so you can just use your Ethereum address.
the only news that brought it to 50 cents was biz shills.
What news will bring this to 5 dollars when the 2 man dev team barely releases any substantial news lol.
The magic box was shilled on biz by whales who bought in at ico and they dumped on you bagholders for x3 x4 returns.The concept was really good for them to shill it no problem and many fell for the trap...

I have no fucks to give.
I bought a lot at 18 cents or so.
I want to buy something at sub-one cent and cash out at $50 and not give a fuck about bills ever again.Either it will happen, or I will lose and end up living and working at a Salvation Army.
I don't give a fuck.
Has to be token compatible though, i.e not Coinbase.
MetaMask, it works well as a wallet, but don't use it to trade in Etherdelta or you will experience a lot of bugs
No whale dumped the top wallets didn't lose any link just accumulated more... follow the smart money
