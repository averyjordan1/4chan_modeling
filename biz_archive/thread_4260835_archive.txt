Also, when the fuck can us androidfags get the good version with ability to have night mode folio?
I'm alt heavy myself but I'd get at least a little of at least one of the big 3 (B, E, L).Hoping for both our sakes the McLadyboys succeed big league.
Every day I wonder if I should even have money in Ethereum and Bitcoin because I only have 2500 invested in crypto
Looking good
My strategy is to safe my gains with BTC.
It's the coin with the most stable growth and when Alts are overvalued and I can sell profits and when they are undervalued I can buy the dips.
Working good for me so far.
no ethereum?
Bought some at ICO of 0.0002 ETH.
Bought some at 0.00012 ETH.
Bought some at 0.00015 ETH.
Bought some at 0.0 00018 ETH.
Iâ€™m all in REQ.
Eth is just too frustrating to watch.
I dunno why that piece of shit doesn't move at all.
It's also why I gave up on Litecoin.
Comfy somewhat hoping for a good 2018
Feeling alright too op, also have 120 PRIX ICO on the slowburner
Fucking miss
Sell your COSS and buy something else I don't expect it to take off until later this year.
I sold my coss at -500 and used it to buy more REQ never looked back
 no ArkLol sell your link bags
That's a stupid playstyle when you have that little money desu.
Until your portfolio is in the hundreds of thousands what you should be doing is going all in on brand new ,000,000 market cap coins with a lot of hype, quickly flipping, then moving on to the next one.
I recommend CFD right now

Zen>LINK.
WTF is wrong with you my man?
Started with 1$ 1 month agoJust wanted to see if it's possible to do shit with only a buck
nice.
i started with $50 3 months ago.
and am now @ $1100.
19x in a month is no small feat, so well done, you know what you need to do now anon.
It is merely resting

Feeling really comfy for 2018 gains.
In it for the long haul but can also play around and sell the XLM if I want.
Am I going to make it anon?
If you guys want to make it, like full retirement make it, you need to have at least put $100k in.
200+ on coss and 100- on ark.
KYS
Upgrade your shit.
Night mode has been out for a week.
Less NEO, more ARK and OMG
bullshit, no way you could make money off a buck with transaction fees
I have high hopes for vechain.
Vertcoin should be a safe bet.Still holding link bags from 0.35 but I am comfy with them
VeChainThat alone will make sure you are going to make it anon, well done.Also upgrade your blockfolio, VEN has an icon now.
buck after transaction feesI used coinbase and "invested" about 1.4 $
I won't make it I swear :(
4261092426158142618784263089426478842650834265735Friendly reminder that 2018 will be the year that billions of dollars of institutional money will begin to come into alt-coins.
We're gonna make it.
lol I made $16,500 in less than a day.
I hope you're not expecting institutions to be buying any of those bags anon
Nope, just their workers and owners.
You might actually make it
We'll see, anon.
I don't care about being a mult-imillionaire in the United States; I just want enough to relocate to southern Chile and live well off there once I finish my masters degree.
Best of luck to you.
No LINK, you stink.

Not until you sell.
climbing out of the hole and selling all your arks, it seems you're going deeper and deeper into the hole retard.
