1-4Hours charts looking great on NEO, strong bull run to come from this.Get in around $38-$41 and sell at $80-$110 depending on the upcoming news with China.
Hahaha you faggot its will go UP today in anticipation of the news, the charts show whales accumulating at lower prices.

I ahve 58.7 Neo waht do you mean undevicisble?
u idiots probably have never even used the fucking blockchainleave it all on the exchange LOLif you had actually used neo and played with it's contracts you'd know it's x20 than ethereumtransaction time for gas or neo  secondsfee = .01
what happened to the lmc call?

GAS = Incentive to hold>look up GAS claim>unless you have at least 1 NEO it does nothing>tfw 0,5NEOBEING POOR SUCK REEEEEEE
 10 Seconds?
like what.. like 20 seconds?
Or like 500 seconds?
bagholding this muchdid you buy @ 45 yesterday?
Can't compare apples to oranges, no one uses NEO so of course it's fast.
Although if you send ETH from MEW to MEW it's just gonna take a few seconds as well.And exactly how many DApps run on NEO compared to ETH?
If you didnt buy in under 20$ dont.
Stop being delusional and greedy.
ETH still pow neo dBFT and doesnt rely on a niche language ppl adopt much better technology rather quickly especially if it's more versatile
Something cool about neo transaction times:https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6tkrcc/how_is_neos_transfer_time_currently_faster_than/dllvqb4/
also when whales have incentive to hold ie gas they dont dump at the first opportunity eth doesnt pay dividends for holding
Not yet, but staking is in the pipeline
all ETH is is a 300 dollar bill propped up by shitcoins
Neo had a small fake bullish breakout.>Lower resistance already tested 3 times and will probably break for a down-trend.Sure, looks great!
Ffs, stop this.
THERE IS NO NEWS WITH CHINESE GOVERNMENT.Nothing is indicating this.It is the Microsoft/Alibaba partnership with ANS all over again.
how does NEO, a chinese company, operate NEX, an exchange for ICOs, w/o approval?
in a country where ICOs are now banned
WHy did NEO moon yesterday?

HE LEFT FOR ONCHAIN HAHA
I'm out at a small loss, will buy again when the dip hits bottom
Bought the dip at 5000
Shit.
We haven't hit bottom yet.
There's still panic selling
I remember last night when I went to every NEO thread and legitimately tried to help people so they could sell then at profit and buy back at the end of this dip.I got called FUD for trying to increase peoples total coin amount for free.Whatever.
Ill snag another 1000 from this.
