well it's not like the team behind the shitcoin has anything better to do
It's already peaked a while ago.
It'll continue to fall.
Won't be going back up.
Bye link.
when did you buy?
If you ignore the shills here and just look at the charts/volume, you'd know its gonna continue to drop.
Especially with most other coins dropping as well.
its annoying afthese linktards just wont go away even though their coin is in the shitterI wonder what it takes for them to stop sperging aboutI think even if the market cap went to zero they just wouldnt give it a restFUCK I hate this coin so much
We're not going away.

If it goes up, I'm happy because I am making money.If it goes down, I'm happy because I can buy more.
