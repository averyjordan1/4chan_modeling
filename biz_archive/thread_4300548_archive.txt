ETH deserves to be $1000
won't happen until its supply is capped
WHY AREN'T I $1000 YOU MIGHT ASK
Explain
As far as I know it has an infinite coin supply, like Doge.
Yeah a coin that a self proclaimed noob can freeze millions of dollar in isn't worth more than 5 dollars if thatSell while you can
Look at these evil retards try to fud the most perfect crypto to ever be conceived.I hope they rot in hell.
yeah but the rate of coin production will decrease over time, so it will still probably be deflationary
