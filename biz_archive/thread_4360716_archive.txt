Guys, don't be fucking stupid and buy Aeron.Check out Etherdelta.
Hundreds of ETH were bought in the last hour.It will be listed on Binance VERY SOON, which means CHINKS WILL SEE AN UNREADABLE ENGLISH WHITEPAPER AND PUMP AS USUAL.Easiest 2x of your life.
Who cares about the token value and company mission?
Binance is CLEARLY the place to make money right now.LET'S GO!
Can someone pls explain why the sell walls are so fucking huge.
Because they are trying to recover their ICO amount at $0.50.
It is slightly under right now.But, clearly, you can see many 10+ ETH buy orders recently.The sharks know what's up.
Oh that's ICO price, thought we were already above.
Makes sense ty anon
shhhttt we need more time to accumulate before next weeks listing on binance!
whats the use of this token?
Jesus I'm a bit tired with the endless supply of erc20 tokens

Fucking hell OP, I've been shilling this coin since 3 days ago and nobody fucking listened.

Same here.The 0.0017 eth wall is getting eaten.I hope Aeron will take off and that will be a stratospheric fly
Not buying your bags.
Who is dumb enough to buy into an erc20 with only 10% circulating?
