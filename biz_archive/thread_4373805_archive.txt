neet living from TenX tokensDo you think PAY will be able to deliver on their plan, given the state of the "dividend token" situation?
I like PAY but I sold all of mine on the assumption that they will not be able to go through with their plans of paying out dividends, otherwise they will get dropped from all big/centralized exchanges for being a security.
Thoughts?
Only from US based exchanges.
TenX was not selling ICO in burgerland.Also its really up to exchanges if they delist PAY for being security if they are reselling it past ICO as the SEC US law is not clear about crypto in general... (just like every boomerlaw in 2017)
Also btw~100k TenX cards are already being used in europe.
Distribution is slow tho.US and maybe Leafs should come in 2018.
