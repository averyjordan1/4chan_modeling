Will we have a "Bitcoin Cash Cash"?
sorry, bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin cash, not this new fork
No it will only fix the EDA problem not create a new coin.
It's a hard fork, so it does create a new coin.It depends on whether people upgrade.
you'd have to be a new species of retard to support the current eda
wasn't the fork cancelled?
fork is cancelled though
Yes it will be called "Bitcoin Stash"
