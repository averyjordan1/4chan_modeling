Good thing it's crypto
nice, just bought 100k and got dumped on
I can wait on my alts.
Sure I'm not maximizing my investment but I'm better off not trading if I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
get confidoed>need to find a 40x coin to make up losses
Lmao this.
I could sell at a loss in the hopes that I'd regain the money somewhere else but I no doubt would just lose more with the freed up the funds
You just gave me a great idea.
We could sell for a loss and buy back in lower.
Then we could claim those losses on our taxes and deduct them from the taxes on our future gains.
Holy shit I have never seen something go down that hard so fast wow from 1.15 to 2 cents in about a week?
xD
a week?
More like 20 minutes
