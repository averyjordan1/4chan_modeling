You should probably give up trading senpai.
sell that shit... its not july anymore anon
Damn, didn't realize there would still be some Sia bagholders alive.
painful hodl.
down 44% myself, justed everytime i check on it.
fwiw i've tried to actually use the software because it is cheap storage at the end of the day, but even that is so glitchy.
can i buy your sia and dgb at 20sats otc?
bwahahahahhahahahahahahahahahah

why do you post about syscoin in siacoin threads?
OP, this is actually a good offer.
Sell while there's still an active market for that trash.
im not sure i can bring myself to sell them..i think i fell in love with digibyte-chan
DGB, SIA, and XVG are my 3 heaviest bags.
Not fucking selling.
Still hodl sia from 600
Sia is a real project but it won't stand on it's own until they have a real product in a year or two.
In the meantime it will just come and go with the price of btc.Digibyte you should have sold months ago.
Even if they can come up with something good the pump did too much damage to the coin in terms of trust.
4385000i am so sick of this fucking nigger
I unironically believe Sia will make me rich.
Agreed.
I'm cashing out at $1.
Did that anon who had millions of sia kill himself yet?
sorry, sia will be superceded by filecoin juggernaut
