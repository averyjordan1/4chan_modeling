mfw when /biz/ is full of nothing but noiseIt's simple: (btc + eth) + patience = free moneyThe reason btc and eth aren't even higher right now is because the funds that would be increasing their value are being bled out through ICOs and failed alt-coin projects by gamblers who think they're going to win big playing crypto casino.
It's a failed effort.
patience
When do I buy eth and btc?
Should I buy after the next dip?
mfw i had 6.1 ETH before falling for the ChainLink meme>now I have 1.2 ETHI hate /biz/, I hate the entire country of India, I hate everything involved with crypto.
I'm going to send a letter to my senator urging cryptocurencies be regulated.
Investing in BTC is smart, but I don't think ETH is.
Solidity and their other tools are not very good.
The devs are self proclaimed communists, and Vitalik is as autismo as they come, and not in a good way.
If someone comes out with a better tooled system to write smart contracts and it catches on at all, ETH is dead.
BTC has a first mover and branding advantage that is bringing in all the normie money, and I would imagine is pretty safe.
It's not anyone's fault that you're stupid
You trying to lose the rest of your Eth eh?
Or you could have put everything into bitconnect and have 20x or more (didn't do the math) by now, in 5-6 months.
You're dumb ans greedy, you wanr eth and btc to make you millionaire, say patience is a virtue, and then you come here to complain that you're not rich fast enoughFuck you
