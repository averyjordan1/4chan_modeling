Am I the only one who sees bitcoin is at a double top?
TA don't work on this shit.
BTC dgaf
Maybe not, but its not like BTC doesn't have a habit of going straight up after a correction to a slightly higher price only to correct down again.
You have to admit this recovery was very quick.
for the past few months whenever it ATHs it quickly recovers and hangs out in a double top pattern for a bit before hitting new ATHs.eventually it actually will crash but TA is bullshit and hasn't applied the last 5 times it did the same exact thing.basically don't doubt bitcoin until it hits 10k
wtf are you talking about?
The past 3 times its reached ATH it moves quickly down and then up (8-15% from previous high) and then corrects down before the next run.So I'm expecting it to hit 8.4-8.8k It isn't a bad thing, just something I've noticed.
