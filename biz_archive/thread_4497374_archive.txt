Fucking retards, you can't even find the news on your own.www.prleap.com/pr/259014/the-countdown-has-begun-for-ontology-network
this isnt new info...its just some nerds trying to hype it up to unload the bags they got when it was pumped from the announcement.
https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Onchains-Blockchain-Project-Launch-NEO-Ecosystem-Sharing/events/245101761/Onchain goes live and there's a meet up with NEO, we're not going ATH but that's more than enough news to send it to a stable .0044 and pump it in the next days.
"Muh bags" The Thread.
meh, maybe.
I would think its priced in.
seems a little forced right now and its slowly dying off.
I don't know if OP is bag holding, but 0,0043 is the new support, is a decently safe zone to enter.I mean, it's NEO, not a shitty PnD coin.I wouldn't be surprised to see 0,005 during the weekend.
Not telling you to invest, but DYOR and think about it.
yeah, I agree its a good coin.
The random growth just feels a bit unnatural.
I will read into some info about the meetings a bit more.
