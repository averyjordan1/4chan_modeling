so guys i found something interesting today, i was gambling and get completely rektd, im only gambling atm because i had just a few btc (0.008) which isnt enough for trading, but thats not my net worth, i have some real state and im currently running a family bussines, so i can afford my basic expenses, crypto is just an alternative business even a game.
but i dont buy btc bc i canÂ´t do it with my non US bank account so those 0.008 where special to me, next i lost everthing just by a mistake on my betting settings, BUT i felt JUSTED only for a second, later i was completeyl relaxed but seriously 100%, and i noticed that the reason that made me feel so chilled and good even with all my (tiny) crypto stack gone, was that i developed a mindset which recognizes the importance of psychological work also, by example: you moon and you feel great, you tank and you get a pink wojack head, but what about being emotionally solid enough for being chilled making massive gains or getting rektd.
i was just thinking that the true bizman isnt the one who achieve gains but the one who keep going even coming from the deepest red!
any thoughts about handling looses mates?
btw those 0.008 that i had started as 0.002 so even if the amount was small the revenue % was good enough.
not letting emotion effect your decisions is the standard for traditional investors.
but crypto has no fundamentals so it's not like it matters either way.
