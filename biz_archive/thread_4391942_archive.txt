You have been JUST'd
I am now delusional drwing meme lines after the fact ever justifying a lower support
Looks pretty tough.
By the way, did anyone see whether the buywall at 1k USD on Bitfinex got eaten, or pulled?
I’d assume pulled, because it was 1.3M and I wasn’t looking for only a small moment.
I think it was obliterated.
Bitcoin cash hodlers, you better hope it was the whale selling to himself, otherwise you are basically fucked.
People fell for the flippening meme AGAIN.
Hahahahaha *sips tea
same wall at bittrex didnt got pulled
I have been gathering IP's, names and addresses, People are about to get JUST'D irl
Bought at 0.06 so not that justed.
Still, if I would have sold earlier I would have over twice as many BTC as I have now :(
Nah, volume at that time is way too low for it to have been actually eaten, I’ve realized.
At that time Bittrex had like 30 million USD (30 minute chart).
