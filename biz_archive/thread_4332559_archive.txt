>no centralization>the more the network is used the faster it becomes>listing on okex, already listed on binance and bitfinex>news after news scheduled from this week forward, with december being the mass newsIOTA is the future, real world partnerships, completely new tech that requires no mining, staking or any shit legacy "blockchains" deal with.Tangle protocol is the future.
Soon brother, soon.Iota snackbar!
no centralizationNot yet, They have a network coordinator which gives the IOTA Foundation full control of the network and balances per address.
You can see them demonstrating that by taking custody of balances in address that either>reused an address for transactions>missed a transition phase e.g 2.4Them taking offline and never turning it back on is something you have to trust them with.
Would be nice if IOTA's tech proves capable and it gets picked up.
I don't even have a problem with the early centralization to secure the network if it permanently disappears after that
