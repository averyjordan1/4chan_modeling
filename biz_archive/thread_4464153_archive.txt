BREAKOUT GUYS SELL ALTS BEFORE THEY TANK LAST CHANCE THERE IS NO STOPPING BTC UNTILL $10000!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alt's cant even bleed anymore dudeThere isn't even any buy orders for the most part books are thin.Honestly people that wanted to sell alts already have, the others are just holding for the long term.
I feel completely the opposite.
Right now is a perfect time to sell my BTC.
Time to go back to BCH for a bit.
Just looked at my Ark stack, spot on observation
haha.
no.
also fuck you shit
alts can't drop much more, many are at all time lows still, anyone that wanted out of alts is already out.right now there's big support for the mid-tier alts like NEO, QTUM, etc.
those are the ones that are going to go parabolic over the next few months.
BTC will continue creeping up but there's a lot of uncertainty right now with the BCH shit, it's not going to moon much harder for quite awhile.ETH has had a good week as well, I expect more and more to start seeing ETH as a stable/safe investment which is good with the Tether uncertainty - could see billions flowing into ETH and the aforementioned mid-tier coins in the near future.
