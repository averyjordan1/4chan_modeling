The cat is out the bag.
The Emperor of Crypto will be killed by its own kind.
RIP BTC.
You'll be remembered as great as you once were and taught in future history classes so the future can learn from your mistakes.
Meanwhile is about to hit ATH yet again ,stay poor m80
Where do all these bitchcoin bagholders and pumpers come out of?Muh satoshiâ€™s visionMuh chain deathMuh coffeeMuh tether conspiracyMuh altcoinKys retard.
Better yet, all in on your coin if you believe it so much.
Let me guess you bought BCh at 2.000?
if you're still buying bitcoin while it's at ath and you're not the one selling for profit -> you're the sheep which was brainwashed by blockstream.
BTC seems to forget that ALL currency is based off the faith that the masses have in it.
History classes will show how it was the first of the revolution but it fucked up in understanding the advantage of low cost transactions and speed (also, the whole other part about the bullshit politics that destroyed it)
History will then teach how crypto was altered completely with IOTA
We believe in Bitcoin as a Liberator of man not a get rich scheme for betas.
muh manipulated mooning thanks to tether
Even if this retard econ take made any sense, it still assumes tether is as much of a scam as fiat.
"Real money" lmfao
