You do realise that most ICO participants are looking to buy more?
stfu until it hits exchanges.
Memes aside, Link right now is a better choice.
It's only listing is binance right now, it's barely at 2k, any times it dips below 2k sats it just rockets back up to 3k.
On a technical term its solid, its the future of payment plans.
The top 10 wallets of link ownership have also yet to "dump".
Even at 50 cents they just kept buying more chainlink.
Of course you can always buy digibytes or even mooncoin.If links not your cup of tea stellar lumens are also good because IBM uses them.
reatds, when wan hits exchanges, dont buy at intil fomo, let it settle down few weeks, u get better price
