I'm holding VTC, OMG, and NEO right now.
Should I trad them for BTC now or will they keep going up?
I bought them all around 2 weeks ago, so I haven't been in long term.
sell all for XVG.
XVG will hit $0.50 end of 2017
why would I buy it when it's up 10% right now?
Please Help
uckingFuck fucks sakes /biz/.
Hold them and wait for BTC to dip to $5.5-$6k range.
buy SALT when it pulls back and SND or PLR
Hold all of those bro
better join bitconnect.
If you have an account, go to "Management Tools" > "Profile" > "Edit Sponsor" and type in : osnie311.
and i'll give back 5% of what you lend
