Here are some more ideas for you my dude:>buy cheap shit off of Alibaba and sell it for literally 1000% gains where you live>make fancy soap (not a hard process, google it) and sell it to beauty shops or on etsy or whatever>if you have a marketable skill, join Fiverr and do that >write an ebook and list it on every ebook marketplace.
