Less than 3 hours until panel stream.
Jemma will be speaking.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbzA87O6g_FJ7rRhKumbRFA
Too late already sold
Why is she speaking on a channel with no subs or videos.
the first video was posted less than a day ago.
Also it has 43 subs.
I'm guessing it was made yesterday.
But it certainly doesn't have "no subs or videos"
You're retarded, that is essentially nothing.
I could record myself taking a dump and get 50 subs.
She is wasting her time not going on one of the countless other crypto channels that have subs in the tens of thousands.
Then do it faggot.
