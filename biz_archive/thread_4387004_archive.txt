What is your honest expectation of the fee percentage of this network?Consider how low ETH fees are...
Pump
More importantly, whats the minimum required for staking?
Not really more important.
Even if you can't stake you can join a pool
Was hoping for an answer
will i make it with 3k omg
Not answered by the team at this point.
If there is a minimum, it's probably not more than 1,000
Nice, thats what I have
My understanding based on reddit posts is that the fees will be dynamic based on the number of stakes and the amount of clients connecting to OmiseGO network.
>had 320 omg>sold to scalp bch>got dumped out>now have 140 omgplease forgive me my brothers.
only retards ever sell their omg
ETH fees are on average $0.25....Also my understanding was that stakers vote on it.Not to spread too much FUD, but it doesn't seem like OMG has hard money capitalists developing it.
It seems like they're true believers in banking the 3rd world.
They've said fees should be "as low as possible"
was trying to accumulate, im not retarded, just greedy.
