I know that posting ref links here is badWhere do people post ref links for exchanges that share profits?
Binance / Kucoin / Coss to name a few.
kukcoin
Yes kukcoin.
Where are people posting their ref links for the bonuses that they pay out?
You can pay people to sign up, ive paid people on microworkers and earncrypto.
Earncrypto lets you pay in crypto.
Ive been getting a ton of referrals for ICO ref programs and such.
I think I spent like $5 advertising Authorship when it came out and got $40 worth of ATS I dumped on EtherDelta.
I imagine these people don't necessarily continue to use the site to buy/trade cryptos after they sign up.
Most exchange bonus is only if they trade too.
So would this only work if the bonus was given just for signing up?
Yeah, ive had better luck with the programs that give you a bonus just for them signing up.I tried kucoin and some end up trading, its definitely the minority.
