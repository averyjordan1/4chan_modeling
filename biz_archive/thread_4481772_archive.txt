Where can I long this?
Not on your dick, that's for sure.
What is it?
Some new toy fad that came out I'm guessing?
I had it as a kid... really think the value could go up
I'm glad I don't have to buy at the current prices, my grandfather inherited me his silver fingerbox his parents got as a present from king george.
I think they're called fingerboxes.
I never had one but my parents did.
I actually used to play with my.
grandparents' fingerboxes all the time.
They don't make them like they used to, ya know?
Wait what, you didn't have a fingerbox as a kid?
They're not a new thing at all.
