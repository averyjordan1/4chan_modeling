Just curious, is the general consensus here trading crypos for a quick profit while its unregulated?
Or an investment because you believe they or will carry a value?
I believe the world economy will crash someday and something like Bitcoin will be in high demand when people don't trust their currency anymore.This won't happen overnight though, so I'm trading shitcoins to increase my amount of bitcoins atm.
trading for the quick profit to hodl for chance of value
Interesting theory/strategy
