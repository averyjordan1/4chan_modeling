I've put most of my money in a project ( the 4 letter project, you know the one), I felt amazing while it was pumping, my mood has never been better.
I would have had 13 btc if I sold at the top, I have nothing near that right now.
Everyday I wake up and its the first thing I think about, I'm thinking about it all day and I feel like a failure.
I'm now scared of making new investments/ trades and I don't have that confidence I once had.Any advices frommmy bizbros?
I know that feel, only that it was 50 BTC in 2014.I'm back at almost 1 BTC now and don't try to think of all the BTC
How?
I just wanted to make it to the 21 btc club.
Greed...
Yeah learn from it.
If your goal is to make a profit then profit when you can profit.
Also you seem to let emotions get in the way of your trading which is the first thing you should work on before doing anything else.
Or you might have to consider it just ain't your thing and look at other ways to profit, such as investing your time on bounties on BTT.
Just take a break from the crypto space, market is completely irrational / unpredictable right now
greed desu
Can you tell me more about bounties on BTT?
Thanks for the help manI was thinking for taking a break yes.
What I realized (maybe a bit too late).
Is that crypto is dumb, its mostly about hype.
>tfw too smart to make money
