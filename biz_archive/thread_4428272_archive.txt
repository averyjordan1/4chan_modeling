Help me decide biz should I put some profits into Walton, Metaverse or Vechain ?
WTC price is looking good
ETP all in top 10 coin next year
Might think about REQ too ;)
VeChain no doubt
WTC will definitelly go up in December/January, but ETP is a solid pick too.
Might moon by the same time.
ETP is still really undervalued.
NEO $100 EOY
who dis
Yeah I picked up some req during the last coin massacre recently Why Vechain?
I have a feeling it might correct because it's had such a good run the past two weeks
Can't remember just some random whore off the chive
Vechain had a good run?
This coin is stuck between 2k-4k sats for weeks.
One announcement after another and partnerships after partnerships.
If you compare it with Waltonchain, Vechain is much closer to mass adoption than Walton...
So this coin will moon like Walton did, its just a matter of time... Of course WTC and ETP are solid picks and I have a nice stack of both of them.
But Vechain is my fav and im very bullish on that.Sorry for my english, its Not my first language... Not even my second lol.
Happy Trading brothers
Wtc is one of the strongest buys when it is under $5.
New exchanges, beta test in December, network release in Jan and masternodes in Feb. You can probably sell for 3-4x if everything implements smoothly.They have also shifted their attention to better communication.
They invited boxmining for a review, website is cleaner, and all of their tweets are a lot more clean and professional with less errors in translation.Even boxmining was skeptical and he likes wtc.
ETP!
MetaverseWalton is fucking stupid over hyped wank, its not seeing proper action for another year minimum
ETP will give you most bang for buck.
Remember burgers can't even buy it easily, so when it hits another exchange, it will moon hard.
It also has a rock solid floor at around $3, so anything near that is a steal.
