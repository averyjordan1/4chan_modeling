BITCOIN CASH IS NOW TRADING FOR 30% OF A BITCOINMY BITCOINS ARE STUCK IN THE THOUSANDS OF UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTIONS
I know the fucking feeling.
core devs are geniuses they don't speed up transactions so bag hodlers can't dump in this kind of panic event

how d-*cough*-dare you call me a bag holder sonny...this is the original vision of satoshi
This isn't true, you can easily get out with Shapeshift.
>Literal 600BTC whales keep putting up buy ordersHoly smokes.
Now I kinda want it to fail just to see what happens
ShapeshiftSpoopy.
I've sent coins to shapeshift this morning at maximum fucking fee and they're still at 0 confirmations.
Fuck this shit.
BTC -> ETH -> BCH
Just buy Monero, its the real threat to bitcoin.
Not Bcash
iktfbI'm considering buying some ETH to transfer to BCC but first I just want off the Bitcoin wild ride.
I recall two days ago when someone was posting how BCH will never be more than 10% of BTC.
GET FUCKED IDIOT
