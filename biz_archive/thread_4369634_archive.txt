alts about to get #REKT
you mean... Alts bout to go on sale!
Not EPY also moons there.
That's your safehaven OP.
When is getting listed on some other exchanges?
Alts can barely even bleed anymore its pathetic - we haven't had alt market for so long, i doubt most will even do -10% infact the two alts i hold are rising against btc they are that cheap now (ARK, REQ)
I've set some low buy orders on MOD.
They always panic sell when BTC pumps.
basing this on BTC possible run?
