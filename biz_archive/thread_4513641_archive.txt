DOGE MOONING.Honest 2018 price predictions?
50 next week
Q1 : 50sat>Q2 : 200sat>Q3 : 500sat>Q4: Takes over bitcoin as King Crypto
it has to go up given that it's tied to LTC mining/hash rates
I think it's up because people use it as a store of value whenever there's uncertainty about bitcoin.Bitcoin is stagnating, so it's time for alts to climb.
This.It's like compressing water, making it go below 17 sats.
Bitcoin is stagnatingYou're dumb
For the past day, there's been no huge increase or decrease.
Good time to buy in guys.
Its in for another moon cycle.
wow such excite much doge, mroe plz.
50sato
Just earned a couple of quick bucks.
Bought in at 18.
Think it could go further.
Loads of buy orders
thanks anons.Would be funny if it became a top 10 coin
It would make sense,really fast network, wow many transactions such fast.wow such low fees many doge still low.
why is the community not stronger?
.00001
excavo!
I don't get it... why does this coin moon so often?
Is there anything special about it?
it's just one of those whale signs that a huge crash is coming soon.
Really fast network, good store of value, low fee's, superior litecoin really.
is this shit for real?
are we about to see it moon just because people start to put value in it thus faux demand on the coin raises the price?
and all i have to do is give it attention now to moon ride?
I feel it's not been in accumulation long enough.
>he missed dogemas
DOGE pump = get out of markets soon
this should try to test a new ATH in the next month or so.Cryptoyoda even had it marked as one of the top 5 buts, with entry as soon as it breaks 21 sats.Looks like its already jumping up pretty quick
