23k (-25k loans + 40k crypto)>BS in comp sci
you can weed out the LARPSNo, you just think you can.
I really am worth 603k.
(606k now as of this post)From 2011-2014 I just lived with my parents and worked at a restaurant.
I invested $1000 into btc kinda in the middle of the 2013 bubble and got up to $4000 trading between btc and ltc at btc-e and whatever pumps people were talking about in the trollbox.
When everything crashed because of mtgox I was left with about $500.
BTC was just staying around 200-300 for years after that.
Around 2015 I was severely depressed and suicidal and so I threw my whole life savings into BTC as kind of a "hail marry throw" when it finally started moving again after years.
I bought about 40 BTC between $300-400.
I put a small portion of it in ethereum when it was $14, and that doubled my whole portfolio.
I made a lot of stupid mistakes that I learned from back in 2013 so I avoided them this time around.
I don't daytrade much, I just do long holds.
If you gonna larp, try harder faggot pajeet
