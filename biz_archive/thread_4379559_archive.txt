IOTAkkbar iota will dominate europe
Don't know about you weens.
But I've made over 75% since October 26th on IoTA
My suggestion to all coin owners - DUMP ALL YOUR SHIT AND BUY IOTA - screencap this.
This groups has only released 10% of their announcements this year - they will release major updates VERY soon - DO NOT WATCH THIS RISE 200% as your sit empty - YOUR HAVE BEEN WARNED
Daily reminder that iota is centralized and not a true cryptocurrency
% over BTCs 10%.All alts are getting fucked and IOTA is pretty much the only coin that's doing well.If you don't have at least 20 bucks in it you are retarded.
Daily reminder that Bitcoin is centralized and can be taken over at any time.
I wish this coin would just die already so I don't have to see people shilling it anymore
where is all the arabic iota terrorist FUD?
TAKBIR
>tfw dumped IOTA at $0.36 because of coordinator problems
Alright, these refugee centers won't build themselves!We need more cu.... investors to pump this coin up!
Iota is so broken they have a central coordinator that handles transactions.
Anyone holding iota is a fucking retard, and you're gonna get rekt when the memes wear off
My negro78% since getting in mid-Oct
unhackable by quantum computers>instant transactions>partnership with bank upcoming
