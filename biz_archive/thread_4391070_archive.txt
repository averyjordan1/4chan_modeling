What is the comfiest long term hodl?
And why it is iex.ec - RLC?
>comfy ass long term with eth or bigger potential with low hard cap on supply>comfy short term with extreme undervalue, modest 2-3x at an unpredictable time in the next two monthsshoot for a buy under 8k and you literally can't lose.
Risk selling the pumps to 9k to accumulate or sit on your stack and hope it moons whenever it breaks 9500.
Either way you will be a winner.
hodl 2000 RLC.
Am I going to make it?
You r going to make at least 200k
How do we add rlc to binance?
RDN is my most comfy for sure.
RLC is up there, too.
Emphy, surprisingly, is another one.
I didn't expect to be comfy with it but yeah it feels like a long term gem to me
Emphy looks like absolute shitcoin
nuls and mtl
How is RDN your most comfy when it's just lightning network for etherium?
the scaling problem will probably not be solved by just having a separate chain doing different shit.RLC is the realest deal in crypto and is sitting at it's floor and near it's all time low right now AND has been pumping 15% every couple days AND needs to 4x to reach golems market cap (which means it probably will) AND will be running half the internet in 5 yearsI just wish I was ballsy enough to sell the pumps right now but I know if this is gonna find a new floor it'll be when nobody is watching and 2x before anyone knows what happened.
So it's risky selling at all, even if you just want more
