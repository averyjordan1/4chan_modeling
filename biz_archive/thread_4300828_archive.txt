Is kraken a reliable trader for europeans?
I need a trading platform that accepts SEPA payments.
Does anyone know a goo alternative to kraken?
Bitstamp is great if you want to exchange euro to bitcoin.
I use Kraken for sepa.
Its reliable
just put your sepa into coinbase and then trade on binance
Don't use coinbase.
Buy your coins via coinbase with SEPA, move your coins to Binance or other platforms.Btw kraken is absolute garbage.
I tried using coinbase but the fucking verfication via webcam sucks ass.Is Gdax good?
I've been trading on kraken since 2015 and never experienced any problem.
1 working day to activate my account/check my ID1 working day to process my fundingEnable 2FA !!1!!
(not SMS but with google authenticator)
you can do it with your phone too, phone camera is betterbut you have to go into the account verification manually, as in not through the deposit process
Are Gdax or Bittrex good alternatives?
They are reliable for buying bitcoins (not hodling), but yes fees are around 5%
Gdax is coinbase, basically.
Don't know about bittrex.
