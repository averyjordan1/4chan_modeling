Thinking about buying a convenience store in Florida for 60k.
This doesn't include the building just the business, I could buy it in cash tomorrow.
But I'm looking at the finances looks like it is expense wise 2700-3500$ a month depending on everything.
Does anyone have any experience or info on something similar?
To make it /biz related check out the coins bruhh
I can think of quicker ways to get shot
I wouldn't work it dweeb.
I'd own it and get people like urself to run it for minimal wage.
