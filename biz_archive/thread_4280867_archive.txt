Before you adopt such an insulting and disrespectful tone it would be prudent to be awfully sure that you haven't been bamboozled by rbtc's reality rewriting-- keeping in mind that the polar opposite of a distortion is also usually a distortion.
You appear to be confused here, pretty badly, and it does you no service.
In my opinion you should be embarrassed and ashamed for insulting all the developers who have worked so hard to maintain Bitcoin all these years.
At no point has any softfork EVER been up for miners to decide.
Any claim otherwise is just an rbtc reality rewrite.
The activation for softforks works like it does because a supermajority hashpower is a necessary and sufficient criteria for activation to be maximally disruptionless.
It will continue to work like it always has for future softforks as well.
Only a criminally negligent party would subject Bitcoin's users to a guaranteed disruptive network split when a disruptionless deployment is possible.
No one should have the right to put the funds of uninvolved parties at an unnecessary risk.
The only developers who would go along with that are the kind of maniacs that run recklessly operated centralized altcoins-- not the sort of people you want working on Bitcoin without adult supervision.
What you are missing is that if a feature is very widely supported by users but a totally disruptionless activiation isn't possible then there are subsequent steps to take to activate in any case, at all times keeping the disruption to the minimum necessary.
This was always the case and the plan as stated in public 1001 times...
It is not possible to know if a feature is widely support until after it has already been deployed, which mandates a two phase deployment.
Rbtc wanted people to believe that segwit wouldn't activate unless miners approved it, and you've fallen for it.
