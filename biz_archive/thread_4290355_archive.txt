the only reason you shouldn't buy chainlink, is because none of us know for sure when the team or SWIFT decides to drop the news... that being said, we all have time to collect corn and get more link>timing the market is riskyone thing for sure: when the team or swift decides to come out from the toilet, you won't get LINK for under $2 for sure.
remember crypto is a speculative market
If you have to have someone explain to you not to buy LINK, you're just going to fall for another LINK trap probably.
A colony of 100000 penguins holding LINK aren't going to all get lambos.
