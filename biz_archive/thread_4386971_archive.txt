I started with 300 dollars on crypto a week ago and only made 100 so far.
And I made them all during the BCH pump, jumping out on time (I heard the rumour that koreans were jumping out at 2.1k and I believed it).I'm hodling 57.36% Monero, 28.38% Vertcoin and 14.26% Dash.
Thy are too stable to make gains now I realize.Can someone teach me to daytrade?
VTC and XMR are good long-term holds and will definitely get you gains eventually.
If you really want fast money just daytrade btc or eth (not a good time to buy though)
>learn how to use Etherdelta (too hard for normies)>buy HST which will likely moon in the next hours because it comes to Coinbase on friday
dude just hold those coins, they are sure to pump eventually.
If you go chasing pumps you are going to end up getting rekt.
Hodl BEFORE the pumps
69kek good larp anon
with your money, margin trade btc with 100x leverage
Why would voting software tokens moon?
you made 1/4 of your total investment in a week, you got lucky though, that was a unprecedented PND, separated the humble from the greedt, i unfortunately got caught on the wrong side, just hold btc, altcoins are a meme, btc is growing too fast, normiedom is soon approaching.
