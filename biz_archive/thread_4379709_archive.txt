pump is imminent
I hope so.
I'm losing money here.
x100 end of month screencap this.
buy my bags

Saw this chart a few days ago, but that was before the Binance competition.
Current depth chart is showing massive sell wall.
Think it'll go back to this after the competition is over?
You may want to check that chart.
The buy wall is huge in comparison.
This competition basically made it stagnate in 0.7-0.8 because the whales just buy/sell instantly.
Exactly.
I got out when it was obvious the trading competition would ruin the very near term potential.
I didn't take a loss because I got in early, but I am out for now.
