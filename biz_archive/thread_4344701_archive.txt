What if I told you Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash could co exist?
big if true.
buy BCH
No.
They are twin souls that will fight until the other dies.
Btrash has NO DEVELOPERS!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND YOU RETARDED MONKEY FAGGOT?
BETCH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
JUST STOP BEIN' A PLEB BETCH.
ETH CLASSIC LIVES BUT NO ONE CARES.
SAME WIT DAT BITCOIN BETCH YA BETCH.
They can.
BCH will be simply used for quick payments and BTC as store of value.
I see we've reached the pleading stage of denial.
5 development teams>"no developers"corecucks ladies and gentlemen
They could and they were, until the owners of Cash(yes, it does have owners, drop the act) decided to go all in.
They can, but both sides have too much skin in the game so the shilling and fighting will continue
The end will end in not an end but a beginning.
Are you ready to see the matrix?
Cash is owned in the sense that it has developers.
Core is owned in the sense that it has private interests interrupting actual development and implementing their own secondary layer applications to it securing monopolistic control.
bch as no purpuse, there's a shitcoin of altcoin that can do better (ie electronic cash system, aka "satoshi's vision")
