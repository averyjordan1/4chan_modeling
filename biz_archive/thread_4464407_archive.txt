joost is satoshi
what if I unironically bought up the entire circulating supply of CFD, then paid pajeet to make an actual working product that utilizes the tokens..
Yeah if the company is NOT an exit scam.
Good luck to those of you still buying this.
It's not gonna make it.
This was satoshi's vision all along
probably not a bad time to buy for a quick double.
even dead pieces of shit bounce.
Saw a guy yesterday that claimed to buy 40k worth of CFD at 0.12$.
Pitiful.
Why bring the baggage of CFD to your new company?
Just launch a new token with their idea.
You can even steal their white paper - it's not like they are going to sue you for plagiarism.
Blood on the streets is one thing.
But when the city is burning and heads are rolling along in a river of blood and the nightmare mother is howling it might be time to leave.
you're right, bad idea unless I was somehow balls deep in CFD tokens already with sunk capital, luckily I decided not to buy at the last minute before stage 2 ico opened
I've never seen something like this lmao
there will be literally blood in the streets.
lotta btfo redditors
The sell block overlapping the buy block
I hope no bizraelis were holding this when they got pajeet'd
How many an heroes will this cause?
The streets are made of blood at this point.
Spooky thing is that this could happen to ANY coin
buy at 1 satoshi
This will be followed by weeks of bagholder shilling.
time to buy, stay poor faggots
