It mooned, now it's going the fuck down lol.
Why is upbit relevant now that it's on Bittrex.
Classic buy the rumour sell the news, It was over once the AMA was close.
Link?
atleast with most buy rumour/ sell news, you had some credibility to the rumour, for eg with Monaco's "partnership" with VISA, it was technically correct that VISA greenlighted them, but most people didn't realize VISA greenlights any credit card company.It still meant if you searched up Monaco Visa, you'd get news articles and stuff, even though the rumour was at the base, unsubstantial
This coin is done.
Landed on Bittrex and recovered some of it's ath (not mooned) next it will be dumped.
On to the next shitcoin.
