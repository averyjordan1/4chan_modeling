Now is the time.
Had a low ICO and about to get listed on more exchanges next week.Low market cap and low volume before the storm, this could be your last chance to get in at this price.DYOR
Cryptopia coming out this week
what, you think I should invest in confido NOW?
yeah filled some bags, slowly though, as volume is low, waiting for a nice spike!
Rumors in telegram of a prototype being presented to Binance within the next 2 weeks, it's likely an easy 50M market cap after that
yeah team is working hard, looking forward to next updates
buy the rumor?
Not a rumour, the founder himself said he's working on a prototype.The Cryptopia listing will double the volume, so I just bought some more CFD.
Yeah I know that he said he's working on it, the rumor is that it'll be ready within 2 weeks
