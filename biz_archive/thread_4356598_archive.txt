Low key gem?
Gene-Chain coin ICO'd at $1million USD.Finishing it's ICO in July, it's converting its token to an ERC20 from Multichain which was too hard to list on exchanges.
It was listed but barely had any traction on Cryptonext since it was a shit exchange...Has anyone else looked at this gem?https://twitter.com/Encrypgen?lang=en

Does /biz/ hate money?
so a failed experiment turned into an erc20 turning it into even more shit?
So, is 145 sats a good price?Are they doing a 1-to-1 conversion or are they printing extra?
This is going to revolutionize the genomics industry just like blockchain did for tech.
Fuck you earth loving munchkins from the moon
 to 1 conversion.
It ICO'd at 147 sats (1/68000)
