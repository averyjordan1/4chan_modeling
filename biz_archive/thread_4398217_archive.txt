Wow it's like Ike nothing ever happened and the last week has just been a horrible nightmare
This falls into the category of "technically still possible, but almost certainly of no consequence."
With zero institutional backing, it's unlikely that any miners will bother to mine blocks with the new rules (even though they could).
Less than 10% are currently signalling, and there are only about 100 BTC1 nodes left.
Without any users or exchanges, it's unlikely to have any significant economic value even if a forked chain did appear.
And without any developers for BTC1, it's not clear that they could even pull BCH-style hijinks with the difficulty adjustment in order to save mining on the chain.
So I'd say odds are it will either never appear, or be stillborn.
