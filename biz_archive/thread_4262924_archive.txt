Hey guys, the Plus500 shill that's CRAZY for platinum here.I posted last night and there were some new comers to stocks/crypto/CFDs and wanted a place for support, I have made a discord: https://discord.gg/wdxGh8aThere's many channels and I tend to spam post my gains and general advice, don't be shy, come and shit post in the respective channels, ask for advice and what ever, post your gains, brag about your gains is welcomed.Todays not over yet and I've turned $330 into $800+, with leverage and platinum, which is pretty good to x3 my cash, I could go more but, it doesn't matter really.I don't want anything in return but to I guess build a community of people that like to talk about money.Anyway:Platinum went up last night to $938 then back down, I've been wave riding and it's going back up again tonight, we broke through the $930 barrier this week which means a new range of $930-$942.It is getting end of week so I suspect it'll be down to $928 tonight or tomorrow, with leverage that's a few hundred $.I'll bump this a few times but I got some things to take care of.
this isnt crypto
Cant find this on coinmarketcap, is this some shitcoin ico?
Where it the best and easiest place to trade commodities online?I bought some physical silver and since then have watched the price of all metals and feel I have a great sense for where to buy and sell, but obviously you can't just go that with the metals physically.
are you making a living off this?
is it easy to cash out from plus500?
also, if you get burned hard doing a trade when it goes the wrong way, does that "losses may exceed deposits" meme true?4262983cmon guys this meme is dead af
what no coiner scam shit is this
Plus500 is what I use you can deposit/withdraw through paypal.I have tested it and it works so I've gone a bit balls deep.I am currently not, due to losing some through some mistakes, which happens.It took about 2-3 days to withdraw through paypal, confirmed it was in my paypal account.I have exceeded deposits a few times and had a bunch of warnings but they just auto-close your position, which is pretty meme.Come join the discord and chat it's a bit easier, you can always leave but I get bored making money, and like to chat with people about stocks and crypto and money and earning money and everything.Money, money, money.
Plus, I enjoy fixing pcs at the moment as my full time job, because it's a fulltime job and I'm trading CFDs there's no tax for that in australia because I don't have enough time for research and what not, so, my full time job is a "front", which kinda makes my autistic brain think I'm living the breaking bad life style.It adds a bit of fun to things.
