what does double top mean?
can a scholar elaborate?
you cant call a double top in a timeframe of like 3hours of trading lmaoholy fuck you newfags are retarded
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_top_and_double_bottomExcept you're completely wrong.
resistance got tested twice and failed.needs to be broken to moon.
this only applies to ATH's right?
Means the resistance is about to be truly tested, and if it breaks, major price increaseif it holds, probably the start of a downtrendBasically, it means shit's about to go somewhat vertical, but we dont' know which way yet.
Nope.
noath can be 7000it drops to 5000tries to break 6000 and failes

search up chart patterns and never EVER listen to /biz/
Always DYOR>Never listen to /biz/>If it seems too good to be true, it is>If something is being shilled, it's a P&D>Never trust a Pajeet
Here we go again.
You are now hearing by some idiot pajeet for the 39834888492th time how BTC is surely gonna crash this time.>BTC IS GONNA CRASH
This time its different thanks to the change in BCH.
BTC core might really have just fucked themselves if BTC dips again.
Not entirely true, /biz/ shilled me on ANS and OMG before they boomed, and just recently again with NULS and HST.
So sometimes you should listen to /biz/ but always DYOR when you do decide to.
this time it is differentI actually had to laugh hard IRL after hearing this 384757times already on every other occasion, because I suspect you dimwit may actually believe what you're saying.
