Which one of these should I invest?
And why?
Do your fucking research faggot.
just do all of them
I suggest etp.
The moment the craze on btc and bch is over next week.
Etp team will strategically start releasing 'news' right after the the craze.
It will start pumping thereafter.
Your choice to buy it cheap.
If you want to make short money ETP LONG = NEOLisk is behind on their Rebranding (major corporation that works w/ Mercedes is going to change the name/etc of Lisk same way that Antshares became NEO).
Maybe they were waiting post 2x.
I dunno.
QTUM .... there's so much shilling that Asians love it.
But the price has done an OMG multiple times that you might start stealing your mom's Ambien and hope you die in your sleep
buying LISK over ARKanon...i
dogecoin
Yeah.
The voting cartels alone, lmao.
Yeah u should really replace lisk with ark,one of the most promising coins on the market

I'd recommend looking into Neblio as well, has a lot more room to grow.
NEO could rocket to the moon in the next few weeks.See Rumors about Bithumb listing.

Already high marketcap coins.
What do you expect from them?
They've already mooned.
Lisk has more big announcements coming than the others plus a rebrand.
