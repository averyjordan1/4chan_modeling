Hey guys I have a few grand that I am willing to put into BTC, but I am new to coin trading.
I've been waiting for a significant dip to buy into but I'm not sure when exactly is a good buy.
Any suggestions?
Also, can anyone point me in the right direction for some reaources on coin trading in general?
Go all into bitbean, heard it's gonna moon soon.
Hit youtube for the basics.
BTC might continue to slide until the BCH hard fork on the 13th.
I'd maybe wait to see what's going on until then.
Good tip.
I was tempted to buy in today as it fell under 7000.
You think we could see a better opportunity?
