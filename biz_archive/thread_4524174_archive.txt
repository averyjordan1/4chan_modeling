Is this even remotely important?
I've never seen it talked about.
Notice the amount of total work that bitcoin has done in the last month compared to its entire existence before that.
it's important in that it's what it sounds like: the total work done by miners to secure the chainit's used as a general statistic and also to compare forks like this chart does.
the growing spread says that more work is being done on the original chain.
That graph is misleading, notice how it starts from 34,000.
