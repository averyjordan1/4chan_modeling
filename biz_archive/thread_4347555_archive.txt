If miners mine BTC they sell for BCH: price goes up.If miners mine BCH hashrate increases price goes up.
This is what every BTC supporter fails to see
If miners want BCCH to win, BCH will win
Price goes up.
Everyone fucking dumps BCH for BTC.Exactly what's happening right now.
Koreans can only pump so much.
No one really gives a fuck about the flippening anymore.
All they care about is breaking even and getting rid of those heavy bags from the last pump n dump.
