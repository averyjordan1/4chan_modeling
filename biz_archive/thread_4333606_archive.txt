Hi op.
wtf happened to Tenx?

Thats not necessarily a bull flag, but it does signal a breakout is coming (in either direction).
I got in at 4$, sucks for those who didn't.
Why do people draw lines on graphs as if crypto prices will follow any of them?
Why does market analysis even exist for crypto?
Its a way to spend crypto on a visa card.
You can load the card with bitcoin, eth or MCO and it pays 2% cashback in MCO.
They have an app and cards out and its heavily undervalued; the price will rise as the cards gain more popularity.
Big news coming in a day or two, get in before it moons!
