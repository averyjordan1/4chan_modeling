As a complete newfag that doesn't even know trading terms I want to start making money I did a few hours of research into Forex trading and e-Toro and they seem profitable, but as I have no prior experience can anyone point me in the right direction?I'm a poor student and even though my parents my for most of my education i still have to make ends meet.
so should I try to get into this or not?
What do you want to achieve in Forex?
What country (and currency zone) are you from?
How much do you have to invest?
What time frame are you aiming for (if it's under 3 months, get fucked)?What's your risk tolerance?
>What do you want to achieve in Forex?
I want to earn money nothing big, but enough so I can make small profits.
>What country (and currency zone) are you from?
I'm currently in Pakistan (PKR).
>How much do you have to invest?
I want to start with something as less as 100 dollars and if it's the least bit profitable then I will invest more.
>What time frame are you aiming for (if it's under 3 months, get fucked)?
I don't have any specific time frame in mind, but I want to see if there is any profit before investing bigger amounts.
