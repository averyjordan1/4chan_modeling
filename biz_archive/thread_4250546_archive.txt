This was the last spasm of a dying behemoth.
The purpose of this move was to shake those of weak faith in their alternative coins.
Those exchanges are really manipulative.
I predict a new event, similar to Mt.
Gox, but of much greater magnitude.
Can you feel it?
You could be witnessing the LAST ALL TIME HIGH of Bitcoin.
Yes... indeed.
with segwit 2 no longer in the horizon, Bitcoin will soon fade into non existence.
This is what happens when your tech is obsolete.
The Tethering happens soon!
The flippening is coming!
DOOM!
You know it inevitable now.
For the rest of your lives, you will be able to say that you saw the fall of Bitcoin... you witnesses it all... on 4Chan.
Yes...
YES!!!
THE END IS FUCKING NEAR NOW, YOU FUCKING DEGENERATES.I fucking warned you... all you had to do was listen.
I hope you're stocked up on some quality altcoin.
Some of them will become mainstream soon... this was your last warning.

NOT.
CHASE.
BUTTCOINS.
You will ultimatelly fail.
I LAUGH SO HARD AT THE NORMIES WHO BOUGHT ATH.
You got literally FUCKT by a fucking echange bot.
HOW DOES IT FUCKING FEEL?
Soon, you will get Tethered, too.
Whales are slowly dumping their BTC and buying alts.
Why do I help you, you ask?
Well, I happen to enjoy some chaos, you see?
I wonder what happens after the US user ban on bitfinex... the "USD" value of bitcoin should sink to the depths of hell.
