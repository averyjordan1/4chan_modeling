I'm starting a printing business that will make custom designs and put them on things like canvases, t-shirts, and mugs.
What should be my policy on copyrighted material if I live in Florida?
Would printing a t-shirt design that the buyer says they have permission to use, but actually doesn't, be their fault or mine?
As long as you make them to only sell small scale to the person ordering them I doubt anyone will come after you.
