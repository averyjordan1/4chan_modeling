Someone who knows money I need advice.
Where else can I put my money besides crypto?
I'm a big believer but help me I don't know what I'm really doing.
My portfolio is totally lopsided toward crypto, little silver and rest cash.
my friends are all putting money into 401k's and IRA's do I need to start doing that too?
Idk anything
How about some index funds...
What type of return can you expect?
real estate, index funds (s&p market, emerging markets, bonds), savings accounts, usually bonds from your country are also good (they tend to have nice taxes deductions), crypto, maybe some gold too.
