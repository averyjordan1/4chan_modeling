Honestly, a lot of meet ups and partnerships with Stellar these days.
Circulating supply changed and changed back.
Stellar’s tweeting something about FOMO.
Something is happening.
Don’t miss the XRP-like moon mission.
I predict a x10 soon.
It will also be integrated in Ledger Nano S by the way.
Like next week.
Circulating supply changed and changed back.What did it change to?
It was 17b now it’s 7b.
Check coinmarketcap.
It was ranked #17 now it’s #25.
Os that a good or a bad thing?
Some company bought big load or what?
Serious???
it leaves space for artificial growth and potential high multiplier when they unfroze the frozen tokens.but what do i know, why the fuck did they take 10b coins out?
There’s a rumor about partnership in Singapore.
No fucking idea
Some guy made an app for ledger and it was accepted.

I was about to make a thread about this.
The circulating supply more than halfed suddenly.So does this mean the coins will double in price soon?
Future is looking good for XLM
There’s this tweet from Stellar https://twitter.com/stellarorg/status/931067070900506624
>buy coin with moonrocket>it goes to the moonIt's my patented primitive trading methodology, the emotional impulse of the market hivemind will not be able to resist the FOMO becuase of this simple symbolism.
Most likely a bank is involved in this supply mystery.
Until people realize that this is the project of the script kiddie who coded Mt Gox and allowed for all the vulnerabilities.
The real numbers are here:https://dashboard.stellar.org/Lumens distributed8,1 billionLumens available17,7 billionI think coinmarketcap just used the wrong statistics.
But it does mean we've been trading based on the wrong market cap all this time.
And Stellar Lumens are way undervalued.
it may be a shitcoin but this reason is pure bullshit
Obvious pnd scam coin is obvious
unlike other coins it's actually being used in production>pnd scam coinStay poor.
to be fair he made e-donkey and left mt-gox way before the hack.
Damn, I might unironically put 10% of my portfolio in this, price looks fantastic for an entry
