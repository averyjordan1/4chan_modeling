>market cap is at all time high, up to 25% since last month>top coins in the green>alts still downBTC is the only one that matters isn't it?
Shitcoin age is truly over.
Buy dash pls
it's ebb n flow
It's over anonB cash was our last hope but failed.
It's been months of alt coin shithouse.
The worst part is that BTC is the ultimate shitcoin.
Other coins do what BTC does a hell of a lot better than BTC does it.I think the altpocolypse might be here for the foreseeable future while all the normies scramble to dump money in.
Shitcoin age is truly over.it just has cycles.
there will be a 1-2 month period in 2018 where it will happen again when btc finds a comfortable resting level
it goes in cycles mate
thisBTC is the gatekeeperBTC is what most people "know of"don't expect them to jump from known (btc) to unknown (alts)
