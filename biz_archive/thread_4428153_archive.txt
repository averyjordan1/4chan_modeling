I am about to hit the end of the month and I don't know what to do.
I only have 96 USD .
Is there any chance that I can put that amount of money in some crypto and earn some more in just 2 weeks?
Yeah, buy NEO for some quick gains (don't expect too much, though.)
Better to gamble on LINK
Link?
For real?
I don't think so
