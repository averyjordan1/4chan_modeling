I think the fact my LINK wallet ends in 666 is keeping the price of LINK down.
I'll send 166.087 LINK to someone in this thread in order to get back to a nice round number and break the curse.
If someone in this thread gets 666 trips they'll get it.
Otherwise I'll just pick someone.

Me?
It's okay, the only way to release the link is to sacrifice it not give it away, send it to your own BTC address...

FUCK YOU I NEED THOSE 35 DOLLARS TO BUY MOUNTAIN DEWWITNESS THESE

Separate the wallets and buy more Link.
Bought 200K at 17cents.
The aim is to eventually own at least 500K Link long-term.
My contacts in the banking sector have discussed this particular blockchain project with measured enthusiasm.
Which is quite rare, for those not in our sphere.
