eth up 25%>mooningyour philosophy on a coin 'mooning' will change so dam quickly when u see how quickly some of these alts rise.
I used to be like you :-)
Hopefully I can make sick gains too off of some, I almost bought powr at .28. almost bought loopring and it went to shit.I'm going to stay comfy with eth and if I see a legit coin like powr again maybe I'll buy it...but you can't expect bitcoin to moon to 8000 and eth not to follow soon after.
Bought some earlier this evening at the dip.
Had to buy from (((Coinbase))) because my GDAX deposit won't clear till next week and I can't miss out in the meantime.
In hindsight, should've bought last night when it was 380.
