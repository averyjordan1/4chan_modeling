I have .4 btc to spend.
why should i spend it on VTC?
saw the website and it seems really basic.
why is it so popular?
cause the hype the shit out of it.
Buy xmr or whatever dont spent money on shit
Put it all in CFD right now
thanks anon i was thinking the same
because it's only $4-5 and it has a halving coming up
lol confidocucks are desperate
best alt community.
BTC normies inbound VTC will overtake Litecoin
It has insanely high volume.
has managed to maintain popularity through all of BTC's ATH.
Has a large update incoming and is also increasing difficulty of mining in early December to limit how many coins are in market.
It will do nothing but go up for 1.5 months.
