You missed POWR, XMR, BCC, FUN, and idr what else is mooning Rn.
NEO and OMG are next to moon.
NEO is a long-term moon.
Maybe 2x-3x by Q2 2018.
Not so sure about OMG although the chart looks like maybe a nice short-term 20% and sell.
BCH moon hasn't even started yet.
The flippening is scheduled for ~50h from now.
What you saw today was just a whale accumulating some sweet BCH before the main event.
Well I mean a smaller neo moon for anyone who wants to get in for some shorter term profits
Please fucking moon and take these bags that I've had for so long
Ya ya ya i heard that last week too
More like QSP
Zencash.
Gey in quick
When to expect moon OP?
why neo?
they tease news and won't deliver, community is pissed a their PR
shit will moon as fuck tho, remember my words in December
neo is being slow its pissing me off
NEO released an apology in their blog and they said that they're goin to fix their shit.+100$ end of the year
Muh long term
Lol the Neo moon target changes monthly.
Hilarious.
4507248you have no ideawhat do you think will happen with the difficulty adjustment?
I have no idea.
I trade off of memes and dreams.However I don't think BTC core will ever be overtaken by BCC.BCC has existed for months now.
Before the huge pump it had last week no one gave 2 shits about BCC.
People only started giving BCC attention while/after it mooned, basically justifying the mooning.
I don't think it will ever flippen
Ripio (RCN) - accumulate.
no, its bitcoins turn to move up again.
the giant has been asleep for too long, it will take its turn.
like 3 or 4 days?
