An ERC20 token with ticker PRPS is under development and planning, the team had a pre-sale for $0.50 per PRPS until the $1 million mark and now have put it at $1 per PRPS.They raised approx 930 K for themselves and 70 K to charity, both of which gave $0.50 per PRPS, though those who donated to charity could deduct it on their taxes.The team behind the token, are putting up ~630 K buy order on the exchanges at $1 per PRPS, and are leaving ~$300 K to the largest investor who invested $200K.They will increase the buy order as more people invest in the token, but they think it's unlikely the buy order will be fulfilled.>What might decrease the supply of the ERC20 token?The team has 1 billion tokens in one wallet, where all the tokens orignate from, but for every 365 days, that wallet is burned by 20%.
This means, eventually no more tokens will be given out via the team through personal or charity donations.There will be another ERC20 Token called HODL, when you lock your PRPS for a specific duration, e.g 3 months, 6 months, you gain a certain amount of HODL.
The HODL you gain can be used for the same use cases as PRPS uses to increase the demand.The person who invested $200K is going to HODL the token, as well as multiple persons on the team who personally invested in the token.>What might increase the demand for the ERC20 token?The same team is developing multiple projects, one of which is going to be a game lead by a successful mobile game dev.
Multiple investors who invested $5000 have been allowed to see the game and have spoken highly of it.
The PRPS and I think, HODL tokens will be able to be used in the game as an alternative to fiat.
Also, they will be more valuable to the game granting more value in terms of the currency called Gems.
