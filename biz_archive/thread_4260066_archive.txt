Hey guys,I think this should be on your radar.
Looks like the dev (not sure at this point if same dev or a new dev) is back, has unlocked the btctalk thread (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1747305.460) and there generally seems to be progress on the coin.Despite that, it's still a 30k mcap coin with a small supply (20 mil total) and trades on Cryptopia.
I think there's big potential here over the next couple months since at this point the coin has basically bottomed out at like 40 sats.
Soon as people decide they wanna buy this thing is gonna start moving due to lack of sell-side liquidity.
