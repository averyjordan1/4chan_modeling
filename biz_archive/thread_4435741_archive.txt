Hey - thought this was public info but apparently it's not.
Last night Ontology was announced for China, released by Onchain, who also is NEO.
(The CEO for Onchain and NEO are the same person).
Some things of note I pulled from their Telegram:1.
There won't be an ICO in mainland China, only USA2.
No official support from the Chinese Government3.
Gonna be a rad party on the 27th in NY CityI'll reply to this w/ screenshots.
