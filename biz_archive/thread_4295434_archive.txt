You have no idea what 'far left' even means
Considering that Amazon takes like a week to ship my things, yes.
Fuck that.
With $80 billions, I'd fund white interests in my own country to the point it'd turn within years.

The current push for diversity is barely maintained above 50% in "democratic" elections with MASSIVE investments from those who seek to destroy western civilization and little opposition from the other side.
Any pushback would tip the population out of this suicidal mentality they don't even want, they just passively accept.
damn, living in mini gondor would be comfy as fuck.
I'd do this too.
find a good woman and travel the world with her.

Tbh I would probably just make sure that myself, friends and family got enough to be comfortable for the rest of our lives, and then use the rest for charitable stuff.
He owns 80 million shares worth 1k each.
This probably most of that calculation.But I'm pretty sure he has more money than that though.
Same with Gates.
It's like if you're measuring your net worth in cryptos.
