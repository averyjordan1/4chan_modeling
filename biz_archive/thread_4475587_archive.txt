Don't worry guys, Chris knows he'll be alright legally.
If he is required to return the small amount of funds he has, he will GLADLY do so.This hurts him more than any of you could ever imagine.He NEVER saw Joost's face.
No, you cannot see Chris's face.
He is so hurt right now.

Not gonna lie, former Comfydo poster here.
This is fucking hilarious watching Confido crash and burn.
But in all seriousness we can't let people blame Chris for this.
Don't worry, this redditor has already pressed charges against Joost.
We will see justice for Chris.
Has Chris ever showed his face?Don't worry, he says he went to his local district.
I believe him!
