What are some tricks for becoming more disciplined with day trading?I just lost 75% of my portfolio because I kept cutting my losses on the smallest of dips.If I had held out, just 10 minutes in some cases, I would be up nearly 80% for the day.
lost more money, you'll learn eventually
literally just stop panicking
I've considered setting a timer for 20 minutes every time I feel like selling.Until I can stomach it without a crutch.
- don't respond to the graph, only to concrete information regarding the graph.- ignore 99.9% of the things you read on here.
look for those rare things that are legit- consider what everyone else on here will do.
anticipate on that
Had the same with 3.3x leverage.
Everytime I "cut my losses" I lost about 0.5 ETH and my position got liquidated multiple times.
stop treating this like a job unless you got more than 20k atleast, buy stuff at lows and dont panic sell like a nigger.
BTC = "digital gold" so you are trying to accumlate more satoshis but if you are really taking L's especially when btc shoots up like crazy you should still be happy with fiat value gains,
start meditating
are you going all in every time?
Don't day trade, basically.
I learned the hard way, as well.
Lost 25% of my portfolio...quite a bit.
Not 75% though, sorry to hear that.FUD and FOMO are real.
People will always be making 7x their money on any given day.
Just don't think you need to chase.
You're not losing money by hodling most of the time.
Gaining 5% is WAY fucking better than losing 10%.
Don't FUD, don't FOMO, the same shit we all heard when we started.
I just thought I would be superman and get around it.
Nope.
At the moment yes, since I only have a few hundred USD invested.
