Guess what, this matches the NULS larper.
It looks like NULS may indeed be the infrastructure used in China with the blessing of their government after all.
"One Road One Belt"ALL IN on NULS.
The PROPHECY
This is literally the comfiest hold I've ever had.>held eth at $5>held antshares sub $2>held btc from $230This makes my peepee tingle even more.
When people figure out what's going on this will be a moon mission for the record books.
If you're not a millionaire, you have failed us all.
I guess I could be, but I only cash out enough to support my hermit life as a cabin-dwelling crypto trader, so according to the IRS, I'm a poorfag still.
I dont believe you!
Redpill me on NULS, /biz/.
