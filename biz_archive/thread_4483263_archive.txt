Meme merchant abides by this, May Chancoin become ruler of all cryptolands.
Chancoin is aiming for the $1If this happens I'll kill myself out of happiness.
>tfw want to go all in but i dont have any shekels anywayTerrible feel.
Easy.
Sell all the stuff that is valuable and you haven't touch in a years time (Tv, Computer, Phone, valuable collectibles, Car, gaming console, Pokemon Go account, CS-go skins, Runsescape account, antique furniture, money from other countries left from traveling, antique paintings etc... .
Then use localbitcoin.com to find someone selling Btc for cash locally, meet up, acquire Btc - get on Chancoin.
So how much will be circulating?
Where can I find the math?
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2152411.0
Only six million in circulation.
Super fuckin cheap right now.................we're sittin at .000000434 or somethin like that.
Any crypto vet knows for a 6 million count that's a steal.
Chancoin is on Cryptopia under "4CHN" ticker.
Happy hunting.
Have Chancoin wallet in your ''name'' field otherwise I cant trust you.
Get extra free Chancoin for them dubs!
>its not even related to 4chanfucking hell guys
This faggot.
This is the future.
4 Chan will get a great deal of money to their website by implementing Chancoin as a payment methods for purchasing 4 Chan pass.
I will use my Chancoin to buy a 4 Chan pass for all my life.
<- truth!
LVL UP!
Chancoin I heard was written in code by the Bog bros.............
Gonna get that green Lambo
No way this shit actually goes to a dollar anytime soon but I wouldn't complain

#4CHNallday my fellow goys
How can one mine this shit?
Looks kind of promising desu.
Hey, we gotta talk about something, and a topic most of us are familiar with is media, immigration and that sort.We're mostly joking, and most of us try to not take it too far, but we gotta pass time somehow, right?Feel free to bring up some other topic, though.
we talk about basically whatever
wondering the same.
Or is it a 100% premine
wavesdex.nl
People are working on making the mining more efficient.
probably finish soon
holy shit this thread is entirely made up of shillsfuck off with your scam coin
gibu gibu
Free moneyz
What if you give 1 4CHN for every reply post gets in this thread?
this is our containment thread, like those circlejerks on reddit
those threads arent't made by anybody with connections to the project, kusy some troll using multiple ip's.
Chainlinkers are the ultimate spamfags.
I'm cool with Chancoin taking that spot.
FUCK Chainlink.
At least the Chanboiz are funnier than Chainlink sad fags.
Agreed, where is your address so I can tip you.
chancoin = the saddest coin in crypto
Chancoin makes me happy everyday.
You are just a sad no-coiner who cant get past his emotions and finally invest in a project which will moon like crazy - guaranteed.
165 people online.
Buy orders have trippled in the past month, more wealthy and influential people start to see the potential in this project and help develop it.
;)
Rolling for dubs!
https://ltcminer.io/228068Faucet coin is the best ^^
These guys know what's good.
You cannot refute it.
>pic related
>we might legit make it thanks to chancoinsI still cant believe it, tee bee ash.
Believe in yourself that believes in the chan.
I can't wait for the trip to the moon
I wonder how many of you are paid pajeets.
it's literally all one person trying to sell his bags.
he's been manipulating the price all by himself because the coin has close to zero volume trying to trick people into buying
True I am Gossamer Socks and I am talking to 10 alts at the same time.
Those 140 people online are me!
HAHAHHAHA I also worship the lizard-man.
Fight me!!!
I think he's actually just hard autismo and really wants this to work but he's a retard with incredibly poor shilling skills.
#4CHNallday
So what is happening?
I have my small amount of 4CHN right here, willing to make me rich.
I hope you didn't go all-in.
I got it all for free.
I wish I could get more, but all my cents are into altcoins that I must hold.
It would be cool if you could tip an entire website.
The owner would have to somehow get a verified wallet to be able to redeem the latent tips.
Sort of like what brave was trying to do.
was tryingNigga, they got it working.
Invest in BAT before the massive YouTuber bandwagon.
Moon in sight, you have been warned.
You sound desperate.
Grab a few Chancoin to secure your future, man.
