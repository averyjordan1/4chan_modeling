Who else feeling comfy they bought NEO under a dollar before the rebrand?Antshares appreciation thread.
That fucking logo kept me from even researching the coin
same without the rebrand it would probably still be a 1$ coin
he didnt sell when it hit 1 million satoshilol greedy retard
That logo was the reason I bought at $5
AGREED.
DO YOUR KEGELS OP.
Nice badge anon.Bought at $7.
Panic sold most during China FUD.
Still comfy.
this, im so sad
I could have bought under 1$ but this fucking logo and the website in Chinese = instant CTRL+WI fomo'd at 5$36 sold at 600k btw
The rebrand was inevitable but I owe everything to that ant.Thanks.
Bought it with btc, not from plushtard.
I bought in the rebrand announcement hype, and then panic sold during China FUD for minimal gains.
I failed anon, I haven't made it.
I could have bought that when it was 1$ but when i saw that childish logo i was sure it was a scam.
A friend really convince me to buy it when it was 3.69$ even if i was still very skeptical about that stupid ant.
I bought 1000 ANTS that day.
Havent sold one since.
Bought ANS at 2$.
Feeling good today
THIS.RESERCHED LIKE 50 COINS, BUT THIS FUCKING LOGO KEPT ME FROM DOING ANTSHARES.AND "ANTS IN YOUR PANTS" SHIT.I HATE YOU ALL.
Where from?
Asking for a friend.
Same here.Jesus christ.
You put 3.5k down even though you were skeptical?
Good call from your friend.Got it here http://www.moderndayminer.com/product/antshares-pin-badge/
bought at 7$ just before the rebranding.
Now I am a happy hodler.
Thanks anon.
My very first purchase in crypto at $5, sold 10% at $45 then slowly sold the rest down to ~$30.Hated myself for quite some time for not dumping it all at the ATH, but looking back I think I did okay.I owe everything to ANS, I don't need to slave away on pointless internships for a shit wage anymore and can focus on my studies while daytrading crypto :)Thank you based Ant!
I won't be selling until 2019 at the minimum.
The tech hasn't even started to get used yet.
