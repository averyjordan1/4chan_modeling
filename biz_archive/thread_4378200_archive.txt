COSS bleed slows!KuCoin volume skyrockets!Which exchange will end up making our car payments every month?!
>car paymentsThe fuck?

Coss will always stay at 50% payout.
They are still in beta form.Once they release all the alt coin fiat gateways it will gain much traffic.
People who have not invested in Coss will kick themselves in a couple months.
Do yourself a favor and read into the payout structure and the current price valuation.
This is a potential 100x opportunity.
coss is shit exchangekucoin is realkucoin still goes down because nobody wants to buy altcoins nowJUST
Get 0% apr loan and make payments with portion of kucoin bonus (keep kucoin and remaining bonus)or...Cash out kucoin and pay cash for car (lose Kucoin and no more bonus, gaining no financial benefit of interest savings)You ask me to kill myself, and yet I still help you anon ;)
