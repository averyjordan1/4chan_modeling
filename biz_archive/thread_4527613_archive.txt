Really weird.
Their language or their arguments all seem out of touch and frankly some sort of bot, trying to blend in as another anon in 4chan.I get why you guys are trying to steal everyone's dreams of a worldwide financial revolution with cryptocurrency, you only want it for yourselves.

Precious metals are always better than cash.
