I'll look into how much this will cost me to put on the blockchain and maybe do it.Any thoughts on me implementing a referral scheme for the ICO?Basically, to drive sales, if someone purchases some POO and specifies your address as the referrer arg, they get an extra 2.5% and you get 5% of however much they bought.I have a few ideas to stop this from being abused, but I'll bet this is a solved problem.
