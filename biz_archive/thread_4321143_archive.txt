Tried depositing to an exchange yesterday and it's still showing as unconfirmed.
What can I doo?
Just wait 2 weeks
its finethats normal now, it takes 2 monthsits a store of value goy you dont need fast transaction
https://pushtx.btc.com/#/You can force the pools to mine your transaction.
Only costs like $100.
pay $67.235 transaction fee, cut your wait time to 68 hours
C U C K O L D E D
they will clear today when the miners switch back to btc after the difficulty adjustment
Accept that your coins are useless now.
You will never be able to do a transaction again.
OP BTFO
 hours until BCH diff adjusts and miners move back to BTC
This.
In about 4 hours miners will switch back to btc since it will be 2.XX times more porfitable to mine.
Why do you want to move your store of value less than 2 months goy.
Just wait 2 years or pay $1k fee goy.
You're assuming that they will switch.
More likely Ver pumps BCH so it will continue to be more profitable to mine..
lol u idiot, you are supposed to hold BTC in cold storage forever.
nobody actually trades or moves coins around, that isn't what bitcoin is for.
just use fiat
My dash transfers are fast and cheap.
just be patient, bro.
remember what jihan said, "the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient".
you just have to wait 2 years for it to confirm.
no big deal.
where can I find this?
Buy some ASICs and start mining.
Once you find a valid block before anyone else, include your transaction in it.
