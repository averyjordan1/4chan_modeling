So how long does Snapchat have left before it becomes MySpace?
bout tree fiddy (months)
All this says about SC is that it was overvalued.
People are still using it.
I still use it, there is no fresh new app yet.
MySpace was a lot more well-known and bigger than Snapchat.
people just use insta now
talk about pre sale bonus..How much did a snap share cost originally?
3 cent?
I don't get why stocks are so interesting to so many.
Please someone tell me why to invest in this stuff rather than crypto
