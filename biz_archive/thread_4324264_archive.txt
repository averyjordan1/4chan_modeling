Friendly reminder that 90% of IOTA's 2017 news is being announced in December.To the wise folks hodling, get ready.
I can't wait to return above $1...Inb4 lame refugee memes and brainlets thinking this is a shitcoin
Good, bought back in yesterday.
I still haven't gotten my shit back after running the reclaim tool.
My addresses have been 0'd for the last 3 months.And no, this isn't because I didn't spam "Generate New Address" enough.
It's because my transition transaction for 2.4.0 took tweeks and was effectively canceled.
Which then the IOTA Foundation took custody of my balance.This is such bullshit.
It's like FOMO, but I actually bought in already.
buying sharia coinyou people deserve to be poor
I feel that pain, same boat.The good news is they are going to start manually processing the reclaim tool submissions tomorrow (11/13) on a first-come-first-serve basis.

Nice
IOTA is hype and shit.Request can do anything it does better and more easily, and it can do more things and easily integrates with fiat and other cryptos, and it will also be online much sooner.At first sign of REQ being used in IOT, get out of IOTA.
Even if you don't believe me, remember what I said just now so you can reconsider later when the signs are there.Did I mention YCombinator is extremely aggressive?
They are working hard to get partnerships with corporates and developing the right environment for IOTA and IoT to thrive.
Wallet user experience is being handled by : https://medium.com/iota-ucl/wallet-refresh-the-case-for-a-desktop-app-8aebaf19520a
Can Request whip out its dick and masturbate in front of colleagues?
I didn't think so>BTFO
Already partnered with Bosch & many other companies who have all agreed to use Iota specifically.
Fuck.
They need to hire louis.
Just image searched this pic, god how awful of you.

friendly reminder>>from redditThere are only 2,779,530 GIOTA = 2,779,530,283 MIOTAPeople always complain about the supply being too large, but if you think about it, owning just 1 GIOTA puts you in a club even more exclusive than owning one BTC (supply max 21,000,000).
There are maximum only 2.8 million people in the world that will ever own a single GIOTA.
Anyone who says IOTA cant make you rich is a liar, plain and simple.
(1 GIOTA = 1000 MIOTA = 1,000,000 KIOTA = 1,000,000,000 IOTA)BTC (max circulating supply 21,000,000 BTC)IOTA (max circulating supply 2,779,530 GIOTA = 2,779,530,283,277,761 IOTA total supply)
I fucking bought above $1.00 and held because of you shilling fucks because I believed you when you said it had "finally broken through the $1.00 resistance and would start heading to $2.00."
Alright fuck you.
its billion retard
Just a friendly reminder that IOTA is a Ponzi scheme the likes of BitConnect.Have fun holding bags faggot
absolutely fucking deluded
nope, you are wrongthe calculation is right(not made by be)
