All right guys, I'm not a pro trader but I managed to gain 50% on my BTC holdings trading alts this year.
(mostly by shorting ETH, trading EOS and BCH)I personally think that the Bcash is a pile of shit and will go nowhere.
But I'm converting right now 10% of my holdings because I feel that a pump is coming in the next week, and that might be one of the last.Also, it's a good hedge if BTC loses value.
