it isn't getting the exposure and hype cause most XMR holders aren't pump n dump quick buck traders.
I'm actually happy about this, even if my stack doesn't insta moon.
Considering the advancements on this project I wouldn't be surprised to see it at $1000 next year.
Man that sucks.
I wish I was a few years older, so I could put some cash into it.
But since I'm a college student, I can't afford to put more than 300 dollars into monero.
Which is more than what I have in my bank.
*released a video about kovri
Considering how much cp and moon rocks I buy I wouldn’t be surprised if it hits $1000 next year
OP is lieng, a video was released not the actual technology.
I can loan you some money, if you provide a guarantor.
Only 48% apr and you don't have to start paying until after a year.
With crypto you can get way more than that return in a year, easy money.
@me if interested

Nah, I'm glad I don't have any depts.
Thanks for your offer though.
Debt free is a good feeling anon
