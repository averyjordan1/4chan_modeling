What the fuck is wrong with you?
Go get a job instead of begging you pathetic waste of air human being.
Your mother should've aborted you when she had the chance
Love you too Anon
>begging on 4chan>too lazy to even beg in the streetsI agree with anon, you should have been aborted
/biz/ has been good to me so it is time for me to be good backThe first ten posts to get dubs after this post will get 1 btcWill check thread in the morning and send to the lucky winners
Sometimes I even think that too
not too late to fix
Put it in Astro and live off the dividends
Get a job and don't spend money on unnecessary shit.
