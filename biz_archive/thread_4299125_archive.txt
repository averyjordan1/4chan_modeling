Now that BTC is dead I have been thinking about what shit coin I want to put my money intoNEO is not only a shitcoin but a chinese shitcoin.
I think everyone in Asia is gonna pump this.
Why am I wrong?
Its not a shitcoin though its pretty solid.
All in.

NEO isn't a shitcoin unless you're one of the guys who thinks everything but BTC is a shitcoin.
I'm a big fan of coins which have national/regional passions behind them (mainly Asian or Arab atm) and NEO is comfortably the best established and known of them all so a solid investment desu - gave me my first 2x gains after I bought the mid September CHINA FUD dip.
I also hold a bit of WTC and ETP (ETP gave me biggest gains of any so far) while DBIX has also been a stellar performer for me.
For you I'd rec mostly going into NEO, but definitely research the likes of WTC, ETP, ALIS as well and consider putting a fraction your funds into them.
Keep an eye on NULS - seems a bit sketchy/PnD at the moment but might turn into something worthwhile.Aside from the Asia/Arab coins really worth looking into DEXs like BTS which are going to be the future as regulation becomes heavier handed.

NULS only looks that way because we are over-shilling it.
Which naturally makes it look like a PnD.
But NULS is basically NEO, OMG, WTC & VEN rolled into one.
I will take the part of the pajeet squat.
Buy Link and REQ
What do you think is better to hold, NULS or WTC?WTC has the userbase and potential right there, Nuls is still kind of a ''dunno about that'' case.
Not 100% sure, but WTC has been around for a lot longer, while NULS is still early money.
It has only been out 15 days.
Though WTC has ~half the circulating supply, I still think that NULS has more potential for growth.
The estimated MC for NULS is ~$26M while WTC is already at $127,941,777 MC.But if you believe in both, then hold both.
