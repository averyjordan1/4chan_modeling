everything is pointing towards it.
Why would it be?
it is and biz hates it because most people here are shilling ARK hard AS FUCK.
Just watch the posts.
Nobody talks about LISK when it moons...
No
true but ark is great to lmao.
But why would Lisk be the next eth?
what's so special about it
JAVASCRIPT ethereum.
actually fits a bigger niche of developers.honestly considering buying at 10 even though thats suicide.
I bought this coin at 2 and sold too early..
read about it dude.
I'm not gonna write a shill post about it.
Read for yourself, it will take you no more than 20 mins.
My main points are:>Wide JS adoption.>Easy to use.>Adapts POSW.>CEO says "I don't care about price pumps, I want the product to work"This dude cares about making a fine product, something that can be easily utilized by a lot of people.
I personally can't wait for the SDK to come out, being a MEAN stack dev myself..
Although I don't believe that it will be the next eth I will look into it.
thanks.
million supply.
It will dip soon
ETH platform is easy enough.
Lisk using JS is lowering the bar too much.
If you think ETH has shitty dapps wait till you see what the script kiddies have for LSK.
should have sold at around 10am GMT then bough back later.I was happy to be making some gains after missing out at the weekend "flippening"
but lisk MIGHT actually be the most scale-able cryptocurrency -- ever so far.sidechainz.
