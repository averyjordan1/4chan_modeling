It may take a few days, few weeks even before the real pump so better start accumulating now.Why IoP?
In the next month or so:> Whitepaper coming> Roadmap coming> Official marketing campaing> New exchanges> They already have beta messenger released (it provides better privacy then any out there)> Partnership with Libertania> Amazing devs (they will do livestream where they will make what IOTA wants to make in just a couple of hours)> Making separate exchange where coins (same as ICO) could be purchased with IOP> Hydra airdrop (for any IOP on the wallet you have a chance to get airdrop of hydra) and that is just the start> Low circulation (around 2m coins)> Just got out of stealth > Really low market cap of less then 7m$> Active community, there is always someone on telegram or discord> FFS buy it or cry laterDon't trust me?

IoP always caught my eye, how deep are you anon, i got 1btc in it bleeding a bit but still believe in longterm hold
I bought a lot.
Managed to take out my initial investment with that recent pump before the whole BTC FUD.
Then just recently bought back in and will probably chill for a month or two until 30+$ to take out initial and some profit
take this down op!
good coin i still need to accumulate fk these fags on 4chan
yeah but what does it do?
dont let biz know, let them continue buying shit erc20 tokens like link, and chasing moon missions and get dumped on
whats the funtion of this shitcoin?
Transfer of wealth from bagholders-to-be to current bagholders who fell for the initial scam
4412878Literally googleAlso,>under 4 million marketcap
keep buying chainlink, req, or whatever erc20 shit token moon mission biz is dumping on you today
why is everything now a plattform for dapps and peer to peer?
is that cup and handle?
Why does the graph look like cancer?
not even shitcoin, its a massive turdcoin
The next wtc
Ask the developers on discord, there are many use cases depending on time frame and as they are glad to help you will get detailed answer.Anon it is your choice.
I have shared with you a great coin, which pill you take is on you.
how is it different from IOTA?
It seems rather expensive and IOTA will go down once more and will then go up properly without question
IOTA market cap $2,242,989,214IOP market cap $3,821,434 like 500 times is IOTA more expensive then IOP and IOP developer accepted a challenge where he will do a livestream on everything IOTA wants to accomplish and finish it in a matter of hours.If IOP and IOTA were at the same price, IOP would cost around 1000$ which it could with hype and credibility over some time
