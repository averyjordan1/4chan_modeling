Go look at the early days of any successful coin.Also realize that rn is possibly the worst time ever for alts; not only is bitcoin pushing new highs, but there's pretty much TWO "bitcoins" people are currently deciding between.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i kept buying link when it dipped but it kept going downi feel like im just burning money into nothingi dont know if i can keep doing this linkiesi feel memed

Nah, you are just too easy being manipulated.
You bought into Link because /biz/ ordered you, or on your own research of the team?
This.I feel like the only people getting nervous are the ones who either don't know the first thing about the project, or they're oblivious to the current market.
Well if we saw ahead of time we could have accumulated so much more as of a month ago.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAKE THE BAD MEN STOP
