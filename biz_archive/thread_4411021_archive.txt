ASTRO - bit of a change since yesterday, no?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Simple flip coin.Get out while you can.
If you look at the sell order book it doesn't look like ICO people are selling.
It's tiny amounts that probably FOMOed yesterday and try to get rid of it now
you guys are retarded autists.
anyone who sells now does not understand how this coin works.... Binance or some other big exchange is around the corner and your weak hands are what makes you lose money not FOMOing.
A simple CMC and decentralized exchange listing caused this easy 2x think about getting onto a big exchange.
ASTRO is a fund that will give dividends worth 50% of their gains from what they invest in and will advise what ICOs you should invest in.
Plus with the token burn and low circulating supply this coin is bound to moon WAY higher again.
No Doubt.
Fuck off, you don't understand.
If I can't make a 300% profit within 12 hours I don't want anything to do with the coin.
Maybe YOU don't understand how investing works, pajeet.
almost fell for the bait considering this is 4chan.....
have huge bags.
Still, dont buy this shitcoin
