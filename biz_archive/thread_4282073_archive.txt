WHY IS BCH CLIMBING WTF I DUMPED THAT SHIT AT 0.02 SATS
Because this https://www.bitcoin.com/public-service-announcement
>he dumped the real Bitcoin and kept Blockstream Bitcoin Hahahhahaha
Flippening fucking wrecking my btc.Fuck it.
I'm buying over on this dip
How the fuck am I supposed to know what's real and what's fake, I just wanted to gamble with digital money, not play jew games
Don't worry.
Coinbase coins go into circulation on Jan 1Jihan is pumping before the dump and BCH holders are all going to shit blood.
I really hope this is true, right now it looks more like all value that SHOULD HAVE gone to alts is flowing into BCH and I'm stuck holding Monacoin and Unobtanium...
I'm about ready to switch back to fiat if this shit keeps up
The jews are playing you friendohe doesn't know Coinbase's gameCoinbase is keeping those coins tied up so Cash can mature.
By the time they are released, a lot of payment services (e.g.
bitpay) will have switched over to Cash.
People will want to keep them.
