They were paid shills.
Happened the last time as well.
I hope you don't honestly believe that
4393063I guess in the beginning they are paid shills, happens every time all the time.
But then they don't need paid shills anymore due to the bagholders who lost humongous amounts of money.
Obviously they shill it to mitigate their losses.
They stopped getting paid.
they already dump their heavy bags anon.you forgot the dump part in Pump and Dump.
Bought in at 0.085, sold at 0.23.
I missed the big pump because I was sleeping.
I'll probably buy back in around 0.1 and start shilling again.
implying your "shilling" appeals to anybody above IQ 90 with serious money >implying the 4chan pocket money would change anything about the direction a 18b$ cap coin will go
buy time
