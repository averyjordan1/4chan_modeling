Wow that was one hell of a dump!
If you're not in, then keep your shitty FUD out of here.
Bought at 8400 and getting increasingly nervous.
I honestly don't know how I always manage to buy near ATH.
Im happy BCAP got a presale deal on this as I missed it myself.
Turn the dump upside down it's a rise now
Happens to me too.
Just try to buy when it's red and resist fomo.
well the dump is not over, wasd only a bull trap nigga

Look at the trends for the past couple of days.
It's repeated itself except the gigantic pump pushed everything upwards to compensate for the huge volume.
It's going to repeat soon
