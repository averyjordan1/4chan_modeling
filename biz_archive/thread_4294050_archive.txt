If you can't figure out a vpn, then you shouldn't be margin trading.
Bitmex is your place anon.
ill toss $1000 at your wallet if you kys on live stream, at least that way your parents can pay for a decent casket for you.
im a #thirdworldpoorfag with a bitmex account, tell me if i only ask for 0.005 btc what would you like me to do?
$1000 buys a shoebox, at least put up $3000 for an adult sized casket.
