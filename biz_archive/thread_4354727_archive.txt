Is it safe to buy BTC again?
I hope so, shit
I wouldn't be choosing sides at this point if i were you
yes
no buy EOS
yes its going to skyrocket again here soon
Nope.
probably not
Well, OP, since you ask I'm gonna have to say no.
I don't see how it has a future at all now that its definitely never gonna get a scaling solution.
it's always safe.
is it at 100000 yet?
