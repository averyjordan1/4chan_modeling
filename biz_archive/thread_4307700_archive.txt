Is now a good time to buy pic related?
last night was before it went up the china marketplace
bump
Its a $500 coin you tell me
noching chong ban & shit
This shit will be $200 in a year or two.
It's not that exciting but it's just the reality of the crypto market right now.
Blockchain platforms are just safe, comfy gains at the moment.
Not too worried about the China stuff as long as NEO's team isn't massive and they still speak Mandarin in Singapore and Hong Kong.
