Time to dump bois.
The GG news is that they launch a competition for developpers with cashprizes.
No where near the rumors of China allowing ICOs again.
On the dump train guys :D
We are the Competitionmarines and WE'RE NOT SELLING
4462130Well you forgot to mention that the competition is co-hosted by MICROSOFT.
This could potentially attract normie money to Neo
Lol fuck neo kek drop that shit go powr.
co-organized.This isn't anything exciting though.
NEO/AntShares has been doing this type of stuff with Microsoft for a while now but only because their smart contracts are written in C#.
It's not a partnership.
Here's the link https://neo.org/competition.htmlSeems like they're partnering to me, got the Microsoft logo all over it
They said the news had nothing to do with China 2 days ago so why were you still expecting this?
Mfw retards fall for the 'we Microsoft nao' ruse for a second time.Doesn't mean fucking shit.
They code in a Microsoft language.
That's the extent of it.Dump it.
morons who bought at ATH
Are you retarded?
Can you read?
They're co-organizing the competition with them!
And?
Microsoft organized and sponsors events all over the globe you dumb
Lol Microsoft did something similar in my city.
They do it everywhere...is this a joke or is this the news?
EARTH TO RETARDS.
Cooperating with a tech company does not equal a partnership.
Jesus christ.
It's says it right there too.
It lists the 'PARTNERS' and microsoft is 'CO-ORGANIZING'.
But keep on buying more NEO!
It's going to MOON TONIGHT BOIZZ hahahahahah
yupthis
