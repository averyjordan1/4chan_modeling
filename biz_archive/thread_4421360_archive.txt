With the Credit Protocol, BlockMason has taken the next logical step in the decentralized economy: democratizing the creation of credit.
Debt and credit are already extremely powerful financial tools, and now they will be strengthened by the security and flexibility of the blockchain.
They aim to do this by creating a platform and a protocol for the measuring, establishment, payment, and transfer of credits and debts.
While there are platforms like SALT Lending that want to enable people to get credit based on their crypto holdings, it would seem that crypto holdings would be only one asset considered when someone went to get a loan on the Credit Protocol system.https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-blockmason-credit-protocol/
