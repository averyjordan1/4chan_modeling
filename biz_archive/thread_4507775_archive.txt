Not sure when I should get in on this, I think it looks cool but no liquidity until 2018?
Maybe I'll just wait.
On the other hand I might not get a good price then, and I'm tempted by the presale discount.
What should I do, /biz/raelis?
Not sure whether to jump in this one eitherAny advice /biz/?
The devs hold over half of the tokens
They hold 32.5% of the 20% genesis block, so that's like 6.5%?I bought in.
They actually built it, so even if their team of autists fucks it up, somebody else will fork it, and I'll buy that.
I'm following it closely because I they're actually delivering where tezos won't.
Might not be a moon mission but I think it is the future.
Locked, or just free for them to do w/e the fuck they want?
Their CTO said he was locked for 2 years after genesis block on their telegram group, but said nothing about the rest of the team.
No official announcement either.
Personally I just don't care, similar projects like tezos took way more for the development and produced much less.
I don't give a fuck about the team, I want profit and I want to finally see a proper decentralised finance platform.
Etherdelta is actually delivering which is nice but it could be so much more.
What do I do /biz/?
The only ICOs I've done were golem and gnosis, I did well from them and don't want to fuck it up like all the link and powr idiots chasing pumps.
Are ICOs a bad idea?
4509119Also 2 years is forever in crypto, that's a huge risk
Grow some balls and buy in.
If you wait you'll have to spend the next couple of months feeling FOMO, but once you buy something you can just hodl comfortably.
What do you want?
If you think it's just a pump then don't get in, nobody really wins at the pump and dump game.
If you think it's legit, then why wouldn't it go up when the mainnet launches?
