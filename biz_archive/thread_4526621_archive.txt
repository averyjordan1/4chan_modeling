Software engineers only - full-stack devs welcome.Recommend me undervalued hidden gems.For example : project [__] has DGP which allows you to adjust the block-params without a hardfork.If you are going to shill a coin...tell us your coin has superior tech.
Do not disclose the name, only give us the tech.
Again Do not disclose the name of the coin.
Only tech.Do not shill these gems to the public... speak in code.
I guess nobody here knows why they buy into projects that are destined to fail.
98% of the projects out there don't even have a blockchain yet....lol yet you pour billions into these projects.Sheep mentality at it's best.
