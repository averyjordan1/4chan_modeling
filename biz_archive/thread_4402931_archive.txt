shit, this is a my favourite meme currently lol


what is roger's motivation for promoting bitcoin cash?
he arguably is a top 5 btc holder so what does he have to gain?
its not money hes probably a billionaire.
when he first started promoting bitcoin he was receiving the same fud as he is now but look where he ended up.
Hes a contrarian and it really seems like he wants to fight for what bitcoin is supposed to be which is not blockstream coin
>tfw didn't get zucked by LINK or Cashhonestly the last few weeks on /biz/ have been a treasure
He want's to build a "libertarian" country (there even is a website about this, don't have the link atm).
Obviously, those with money have power in such a society.
Having not only money but control over the currency used in such a country gives you power beyond imagination.
That's my opinion about this issue.
don't get too emotional about coins anon, or you will lose.
what do you think is more likely to happen first, BCH going from 850 back up to 1700 or bitcoin going from 8k to 16kIf you think its the first then you buy BCH.
It's really that simple
Actually kind of cute
