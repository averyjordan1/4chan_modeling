80% of my life is about cryptoI don't make music anymore, I don't party much anymore as I'm using most of my money to invest in crypto.
I still socialize as I have a good network, but then I still check on news and price action on my phone.Crypto has changed my life because I know it will get me rich.
faggots tell me of your story
Same.
It's only temporary though.
Eventually we won't have to check so often because we'll have enough to be comfortable and we can let our gains happen over longer periods.
If you bought eth last year with a couple grand, you would have been rich.I'm expecting the same wave to hit next year.
We'll all make it this time.
You holding LINK fegget?
My whole life is crypto, DMT, vaporwave and furry porn.
In that order.
All my money is tied up in other coins, and I won't cash out until I'm rich.
But link is a steal right now for anyone out there.
chris is that you?
