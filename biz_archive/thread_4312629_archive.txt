My brother and I used to play chicken.
He was always the far stronger swimmer.It was the last time we swam together.
Out into the open sea.
But Something was very different about that day.
Until the impossible happened.
I was the one moment that my brother was not as strong as he believed and I was not as weak.
It was the moment that made everything else possible.
