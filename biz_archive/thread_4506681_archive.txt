We all know why too.............because these idiot devs made coin counts of over 200 million.
When Bitcoin rises it overinflates their marketcaps and people dump to oblivion.
That trend will continue folks.
Only invest in small coin caps and you'll be safe.
I've learned my lesson.
Confido, make up for your loss.
