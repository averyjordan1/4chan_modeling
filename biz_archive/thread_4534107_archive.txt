Bitcoin ATH is like $8300.
Even though Bcash is pumping, BTC is not going down.
People are pulling money from alts (see https://coinmarketcap.com/).
BCH gone up 8 bil>BTC falling explains 4 bil>overall marketcap gone up explains 1 bil>alts explain the other 3 bilBTC fell by the proportion of its marketshare, get over it core cuck
thinking deluded necomers to crypto will understand this, i have frinds that are new in the game, nad they just seebitcoin red, bch green, omg flippenong.
but no.
Money is not leaving BTC.
This is less than 2% drop.
We had a drop bigger last week, is what im saying.To be clear, im not saying BCH is not rising, im saying that money is not coming from BCH.
If it was, then BTC would be down 7-10B.
That's why I believe nothing is going to happen.
This isn't a massive orchestrated attack—at least yet—because we'd see Bitcoin falling as BCH was rising just like last time.
Bitcoin is doing fine because so much new money has come in from people who don't know what alt coins or Bitcoin Cash are.
They aren't touching their money.
The BCH rise is just due to the people like ones on /biz who believe that Operation Dragonslayer is imminent and some whales having some fun.
Cash may pump, but Bitcoin is going nowhere.
And that's good for everyone.
This will show that Bitcoin is resilient and a safe investment and hopefully it will get more people interested in investing in alt coins.
How dense are you?
the math is not complicated>BCH up 8 bil>BTC down 4 bil despite overall crypto market cap going up
ya sorry thats not how markets work
It's cult-like worship at this point for Bitcoin fags.
