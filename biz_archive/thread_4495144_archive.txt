SOMEBODY HELP ME.
MY MONEY IS BEING FLUSHED DOWN THE LINK TOILET
One thing.
I don't know why.It doesn't even matter how hard ya try.
Oh linkies.
What would the world of cryptocurrencies be without you?
What do, we owe the honour.
The promise of Link seemed glimmering at first.
The premise of 'rent free' was surely innovative and ahead of its time.
But, as time showed us, this coin was nothing more than a pump and dump that inadvertently created the most deranged community of bag holders known to man.
A community that incessantly screeches "rent free" whenever they feel threatened, which is very common.
To be a linkie is to be deranged.
Having lost everything, whether it be your house, marriage, wife's sons college money or life-savings surely takes a toll on the mental serenity of a linkie's mind.
Slight threats critiquing the developers of Chainlink sets the common linkie into a state of neurosis that can only be cured by euthanasia or the eventual revaluing of this godforsaken currency.
However, once the price reaches 10 cents, the value will continue falling.
This crash will be catalyzed by the fact that thousands of wallets will be lost as a mass suicide of linkies, causing the price to dip even further.
Don't be deranged, don't be a linkie
You stand to inherit $500 MM just send $50 to redeem.
Link will probably get pumped again one day, but IMO it isn't the right alt to invest in

Link is literally about to leave the top 100 on CMC.Once that happens, it will cease to exist for normies.4chan Linkies will be alone with their coin forever, still clinging to the promise of a moon mission that will never come.
