Shill me pajeets
hello sirbuy monero yesthank you
Yes.
It has a function and does that function well.
Unless it gets FBI backdoors, it will remain a player and a solid investment but it will never be King because of its anonymous nature.
literally underworld coin.
tons of people want it but no one wants to be associated with it
bitcoin is obviously the king but i would say that monero is the king of altcoins and is in for a big rise in price very soon
> the only coin that is in green all the time lately
it isi'm not sure if it's worth over dash, tho
shill shill shill
What's the best way to buy 1 Monero with fiat?
I'm a compulsive hodler and don't want to spend my btc/bch/lgbt.
I don't care which currency, I can buy with rupees if necessary, but I just want a Monero with minimal fees.
Fuck Monero, I truly hate this piece of shit
Worth it if you want drugs
Care to explain why?
if its always green even when market's dramatic, then it's a coin to buy and hold
Real satoshi's vision
