LINK fucking explodes.> BTC Begins to dip even more, alts stabilize slightly under new ATH.> BTC value has 1,000x'd.> dump all those heavy ass bags.> 5,000 BTC Club.> 1 months later BTC is now $1.> 2 BTC per day withdraw limit because you lied about home country.> realize lost half life savings.> tfw it will take over 3 years to withdraw a mere 2 BTC per day.
