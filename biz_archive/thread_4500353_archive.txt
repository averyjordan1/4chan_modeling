Fuck you, r/bitcoin,You stand against everything that Bitcoin and blockchains were created forhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eil12/evidence_that_the_mods_of_rbitcoin_may_have_been/
Fuck off.

Exactly, this isn't reddit.
So I can say whatever I want without anyone removing my posts or comments.

/r/bitcoin - censored shithole/r/btc - *autistic screeching*
Yeah it's totally not relevant that there is a large scale astroturfing and social media pumping campaign going on aided by botnets/bought accounts.
If people are actually willing to go through the trouble to pay for sentiment on reddit, do you think they'll just pass us by?
You can tell people to wise up and that 99% of this board will be shilling anyway, but this is obviously much bigger than your typical shill case.
You can shift a presidential election with this kind of memetic shillforce, do you think pumping a fucking memecoin is hard?
go suk Rodgers dick.
Bcash is shit.
Bitcoin is the real deal.
lose money and kill yourself.
implying this isn't a falseflag campaign to make the real bitcoin look bad>using redditBTC is going to go to 10k, no amount of your FUD will stop that.
true if big.
t. core shill
BCH bag holders are going to get burned again for like the 4th time.
This time more whales will cockblock your flippening.
can I get a quick rundown?
Someone on reddit said something

r/bitcoin moderators have been up to a fair amount of shady stuff in the past on reddit.
This time there is evidence to link them to hacking reddit accounts and using said accounts to upvote r/btc (BCH supporter subreddit) posts and downvote r/bitcoin (BTC supporter subreddit) posts.
Inb4 making a thread to accuse that r/btc is attacking them with bots.Mind you, this aint 100% proof, but pretty fucking close.
One of the persons behind this hacking might very well be Greg Maxwell (a Core developer) himself.
Ideally this would mean the disbanding of r/bitcoin and putting Greg Maxwell into jail for hacking.
Nothing like this will probably happen though.
100% proof is hard to get and reddit admins won't dare the meddle with Bitcoins affairs.The idea of Bitcoin is freedom from companies with no one manipulating the system.
Meanwhile a Core developer is linked to hacking into reddit accounts and using them to create his own narrative for BTC and BCH debate.If reddit doesn't investigate this further, then the site is confirmed to be a shithole as many here at 4chan already point out.
R/bitcoin and Reddit are confirmed to be censored circlejerk hubs already long ago.
Stay at /biz/ and think for yourself.
This place is brigaded as well, but nobody will censor anything.
