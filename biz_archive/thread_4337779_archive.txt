Should I get into this ICO Anon, what are your thoughts?
% discount.
High chance of being dumped on.
% discount for the ICO itself or pre-sale?
Donâ€™t buy into any ico that advertises in Blockfolio.
They are basically targeting gamblers with that shit.
Oh, so they're giving them away for free?Fucking pajeets can't even be bothered to learn percentages.
pre-ico investors got tokens for half the price of ico investors.
guaranteed dump
Yes I was going to invest in this but 100% you will get dumped on when it his exchanges due to the pre-sale bonus.
Why the fuck to ICOS do this shit.
4337861so would it be at least kind of wise to buy, once it drops 50% on exchanges?
I got into KYC just in case, but it seems like super shit.
Yes this wont hold the ICO price, buy on etherdelta if you really want the coin.
Massive discount, not buying until dump.
