Well Lads, it's fair to say POWR is dead now.
Thankfully I got out with my massive gains HAHAHAHAH why are you niggers still holding
10 days in>dead
>mfw it moons and you get left behind
Mfw you're too greedy to not take profit from POWR and not jump into HST for the next moon mission
why are we still holding?
Because we're not 14yo faggots raised in the age of instant satisfaction.
We have actual knowledge of investing and not failing while pretending to be a swing trader with mommy's 10$ allowance.Pro tip: learn to practice patient and not expect instant things to happen.
It'll save you from being a 25 yo emo ready to eat a bullet because life wasn't fair to you
