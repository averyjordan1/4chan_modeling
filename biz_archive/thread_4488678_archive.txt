Will a price dip happen again like a few months ago?
Why did it happen?
Was that just a one-time thing?
I was waiting for it to go back to 5k but now I'm not so sure....
probably not.
we are in wave 5/5, this motherfucker is going to the moon, which should be between 12K and 20K, without guarantee
Can confirm dip occuring.
This is the top
Do you think I should invest in bitcoin or other low-cap stuff like ODN?
I'm hearing a lot of conflicting information.
enjoy liquidation
Why did the dip happen?
Regarding bitcoin it's a gamble at this point, hard to tell when and how it crashes, but I'm pretty confident we will see some upward moment.
ODN, never heard of.
But as a general rule of thumb, don't gamble with liquidity you can't lose.
It always does.Prediction: Somewhere around $8,550, possibly tomorrow evening, BTC recoils again and dips just below $6.500 before cruising back OVER9000.
XMR should be slightly more stable through the BTC corrections and subsequent rise, so I'll just bounce back and forth between the two and maek a killing.Good luck, anon.
