BCH back below 8k, what does it mean guys??
Buy BCH now if you want a profit is what it means.
Means nothing at all, was massive sell walls everywhere at $8000 that had to be eaten.
Was a massive milestone like every $1,000.
Should wait til it drops to 0.1 during the week.
gonna test 7k support again probably...i need one more alt pump to sell my bags for btc 10k moon.
