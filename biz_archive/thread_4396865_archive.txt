Unless you are a published theoretical physicist and have earned a Master of Science and two PhDs, have an IQ of 187, and went to college at 11, research String Theory at Caltech, switched disciplines from bosonic string theory to heterotic string theory and reconciled the black hole information paradox using a string network condensate approach, worked on the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations and considered a method for optimizing a 500 GeV particle detector to this end, jointly wrote a paper on supersolids to be presented at an Institute of Experimental Physics topical conference on Bose-Einstein condensates, keep a whiteboard in the living room for scientific theories containing virtual particles in quantum mechanics or series of Riemann zeta functions, then you should not invest in ARK.
Your primitive brain...actually in your case it’s more of a “protozoan brain-like structure,” couldn’t possibly fathom the depths of smart bridge technology, or encoded listeners, or push button deployable blockchains.
Stick to things you’re good at, like watching reruns of The Walking Dead, sitting naked on your rented couch, eating store brand chips.
LISK is BTFOing you, you lost, idiot
Stop, I haven't finished accumulating!
haha
T H E
BTFO where ?
i cant see itall i see is ark increasing value
you know why ARK will do well, they are hitting the schools and Hackathons, let me just say I used to film those and AirBNB as well as Pintrest where two Apps that where cycling those events (Much like ARK is) we know where those two companies went.
ARK.io will be 17 by EOY 2018 BQX will be 20 by EOY 2018
Mobile wallets at 98%, fuck this is gonna blow up soon.
haha are you stupid, ark increases like 5 % while Lisk goes up 20%.
You are supporting a hopeless copycoin with no community
How new is this pasta?
It's impressive
