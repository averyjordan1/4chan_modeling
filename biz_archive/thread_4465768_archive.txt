So I made this bunch of Hellraiser memes to FUD and accumulate more.
Obviously.
So I went into my meme template to do some new meme.
Then I realized that my pink wojak template (an image file) lost it's color pink.
Technically this is beyond impossible (because image was imported directly and color was not editable).
I only have one explanation for this>soon launching
Im genuinely curious, do you hold LINK?
I saw another thread where you said you also hold LINK kek.
Your memes aren't very good.
K Link, yes.
And this color change story is fucking real.
I have seriously no explanation why it went from pink to this.
It simply changed and was NOT editable.
Yeah hellraiser is not a good meme OP.
FFS it's a movie from the 80s no millennial has watched
this one is great
Lets give OP new material, whats a recent anime or movie that could replace hellraiser?
I love this board lol even if LINK never goes to the moon (yeah right) I appreciate the laughs ladsLOVING EVERY LAUGH
Itâ€™s a sign to stop making fud memes and use your GIMP skills to help people get rich.
yeah, shilling soon.
>just need a new theme for thisit's not that I feel I accumulated enough... but I just ran out of cash to invest more.
So why fudding..
not using GIMP though
