>not throwing at least 3 ETH in a beautiful under the radar coin.
where this shit trading ?
shhh not done accumilating
binanceThe bch drama has masked it, which makes it a good catch, so I think now is great to put a little something in.
It will be another Nuls
holy shit
what's the market cap?
Listen very carefully to what I'm about to say.
Ambrosos wants to represent external data (food) on the blockchain.Walton wants to represent external data (RFID tags) on the blockchain.Ripple wants to represent external data (financial transactions) on the blockchain.These use cases are ENTIRELY contained within ChainLink.
ChainLink is the skeleton key that makes all these proects obsolete.
It gives every company the building blocks to use oracles that represent ANY data, not just single use cases like food/RFID/financial transactions, however they want.
no ones gives a fuck about that chainlink shit
Seen this shilled by same guys on Twitter who tipped off ENJ, NULS and HST so definitely got potential - if I had spare funds I'd be putting into it.
