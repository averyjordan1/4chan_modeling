What exactly is it?
doesn't have segwit.
has 8mb blocks instead of 1mb.
this gives them better scaling for now, but they won't have segwit features later on.
>Who is behind it?there is a reason the bitcoin developers chose not to go with bigger blocks, but if you're a miner or business interest you want scaling right now and don't want to wait a year.
plus, the scaling solutions proposed by bitcoin are layer based and mining interests want to keep everything on chain to max profits.>Why should I buy it / why not?it's very high risk.
their developers have already fucked up once and they just had a fork because of it.
i consider it basically a scam backed by centralized chinese miners who want total control of bitcoin.
they're likely consolidated above 51%, have been spamming the BTC memepool, using the bitcoin brand to confuse people, have a CEO, have a marketing fund, using social farms, backed by a bunch of unsavory characters.
