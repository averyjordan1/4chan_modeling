If you are buying bch right now you are retarded.The classic team is another that thinks block size increases are a good solution to scaling.
They see that bch is the big fish in bigger block sizes.
They see they are wasting their time.
Where they go wrong, is that no one else thinks bigger block sizes are the right fix and will stick with core.
