I understand that's a big if at this point, but I'm taking that risk.
Any DRPBros out there?
Forgot to add the dex/derivatives are slated to be released Q2 2018
Holding 4800 DRP.
Forgot to mention the dividends aspect of DRPS.
Does anyone know the ins and outs of where these dividends come from and how theyâ€™re paid out?
Yeah I did forget about that because I don't know a lot about it.
Are the dividends from the VC side of things, the DEX side, or both?
