Companies take years and decades to go from zero to heroes.
And then theres crypto, where every retard thinks he is special for investing in a special project that is guarranteed to x1000 his money in 2 weeks.And then they go full wojak once their would have been x1000 turns out to be x0.5And these ppl don't want to learn.
They honestly believe they can continuously flip ICOs and alts to lambos from <$1000 even after they have lost whatever bread crumbles of wealth they had.God, what have I dragged myself into.I see only 2 ways out: hodling whatever shitcoin you believe in to postpone that bitter taste of free market's relentless dick or go deep into algorithmic training.I'm pretty sure the only sensible men investing in crypto are the ones that already have lambos and hoes, so they see all this as some kind of fun gamble
