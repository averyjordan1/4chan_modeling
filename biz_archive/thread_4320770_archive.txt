Hi guysJust letting you know that one of these days, XMR is going to go parabolic, so make sure you've stocked up.
It is the only coin in a position to replace BTC as the gold standard store of value in crypto.
Nice run starting now, let's see where we go.
Monero approved.
Yep, I expect much of the profits taken from BCH will flow into Monero.
I'll be very surprised if we don't pass $150 today.
Monero the hackable anonymous coin.
Ou oksy gotcha.
Here we go.
Big boys incoming
I'm a huge fan of Monero and I hold it, but I don't think it can replace Bitcoin as a store of value.
The opaque blockchain is good for privacy but you can't audit the coin to know the supply or if someone is breaking the rules and duplicating coins.
Also, it has indefinite inflation (admitably small compared to fiat though).
probably will be 200 usd before the end of the year
i woudn't be surprised if it hits 200 before the end of the month
i think we are seeing a meme forming, get in boys
Already have my orders set
Honestly with all of the planned upgrades, DNM adoption, and the huge pump of the entire market coming in 2018, I'm expecting XMR to hit $1,000 by the end of next year
if more people understasnd the system behind monero easy #3 marketcap
4321438Monero should be at least #3 purely by virtue of the fact that it is actually used, it has a practical purpose right now unlike pretty much every other shitcoin.
This coin is such a flaming piece of shit.
Iâ€™d never use it
What pump exactly?
?I'm holding 50 but mainly because I'm hiding from the btc/bcc nonsense.
That post is just fud.
xmr is a solid coin.
XMR is used on dark markets , it has an underlying demand.
the weather is cold and horrible , people will buy more drugs now !!
