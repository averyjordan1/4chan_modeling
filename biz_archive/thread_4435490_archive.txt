From reddit:They use to run a research site at https://picoloresearch.com/ with 10K+ subscribers.CEO is Matthew Dibb, who started out at Macquarie Bank, one of the world's largest investment banks, specializing in fixed income and structured products.He was previously MD of Wise owl.
"Wise-owl is the leading research firm of ASX and SGX small cap equities research.
Wise-owl is a data partner of Etrade, Bloomberg and Reuters."
Wise-owl has been around since 2001 with 100K+ paying customers ($39/mo is their cheapest plan).
https://www.wise-owl.com/Source: https://standardresume.co/matthewdibbTaaS is a similar project and ended up only raising $7.7Mil, so they only have 8Mil tokens circulating.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/taas/ current market cap: $40 millionASTRO should have around 4mill circulating with around $3mill raised.
Let's assume they vested 2.5mill into the market and make $500k profit next quarter (20% growth on their crypto portfolio), dividend should be 12.5c per coin x 4 quarters = 50c/year.
Not bad for a coin that's priced around $1 right now.
So let's assume cost price of $2 per ASTRO coin.2000 coins x $2 = $4000 buy price.
2000 coins @ 50c ETH payout per year = $1000/year in ETH dividendsTass was priced around 82c when it hit the market and had ATH of $6.57.
It's around $5 right now with market cap around $40 mill.ASTRO market cap is around $3mill right now.
If it can do something similar to TAAS, I don't see it being around $3mill market cap for long.
If you believe the cryptocurrency market will no longer grow, then ASTRO isnt for you.
If you think it will grow, it might be an interesting play.
only on biz...hey man, thanks for the insight!
the market always needs competition, seems like taas has proved this kind of token has a need.will def be doing more of my own research, but happy to learn more about the ceo.
