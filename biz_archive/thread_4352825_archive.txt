Realistically, what are the chances of Litecoin going above $1k by some miracle?
fifty-fifty
Pretty low, dont count on it
how about you put 500$ in and focus on trading up 1% every day for a year, you'll have ~50k after that year
Never.
XMR, maybe.
I don't have XMR btw.
I fucking wish.
Litecoin has been around for a long time and has never jumped like bitcoin.
Its like bitcoin is the gold and litecoin is silver.
It will go up im sure but slowly but don't ever think it will get to 1k.But then again i don't know shit and their is a 50-50 chance anything could happen to any one of those shitcoins
