These whales have been accumulating alt coins at near rock bottom prices.
When will these greedy bastards let everything moon?
Also the people dumping need to be shot!
I'm calling for a market wide end to accumulating and dumping effective immediately.
Spread the word, Anons.
Let the whales and dumped know we've had it!
Just because shits dumping doesnt mean whales are accumulating
Whales are leaving.There's just too much new money being pumped into Bitcoin.
Pretty sure whales make more money on alts.
Whales are always accumulating.
It's time they start pumping so they can buy new lambos and dolphin shaped speed boats and the rest of us can pay six months rent.
