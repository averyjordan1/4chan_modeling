The only way to win crypto is to buy coins on the ground level, around ICO price, like Link is right now.
Then you got a straight path up.
Buy trash like neo, omg, lisk, and all you're doing is making their early holders exponentially richer at a shot for 20-30 % gains.
The only way to win crypto is to get on the top of the pyramid, and just hold for 12-15 months.
Let that next round of stupid cucks buy in at $5, $10, $20 and make you richer and richer.
That's not just Link but stuff like Req Network and a few others.
You got a shot to be an early holder for once.
You got a shot to be an actual whale in a coin.
Will you take it, or will you just go around making other whales richer?
please buy my bags
REQ is the same way, imo.
Actually, REQ is buried deep underground.
OP is right.
enough is enough.
stop being a cuck.
time to man up.
take a risk.
take the road less traveled.
do your research and then choose LINK.
Not a REQ holder but desu for the graph, despite being under ICO price, it looks like a good time to buy if you believe in the project long term.
If you haven't bought, the coin just reaching ICO price is a solid gain.
Simply deranged
4495594Yeah I just bought in today, some YUGE news in December that wil affect price BIGLYthe price being almost negative is really attractive for such a solid project.
Easily a top 20 coin imo
Can't tell if youre in denial or just new and naive.
You're mistake is assuming all coins and ico's follow the same trend.
Clearly LINK has little utility these days.
Just sell now while you have the chance.
pretty much every coin has 10xd since last yr
