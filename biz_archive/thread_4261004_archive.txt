TOLD YOU!!
This shit is back mooning already, there is still time before the halvening in December, get in or kill yourself once this shit reaches 10$more than a 400% percent growth in a month
Guess I will kms then
So what is the halvening?
FuckI was telling normie coworkers about this at $0.50 and never bought any myself at the timegonna kms too
Did they buy?
The mining reward per block will be reduced from 50 to 25 VTC>lower supply>higher demand>price goes upLink faggots and dumbasses wanting to shill their shitcoins will disagree, but just check VTC charts, and if you have been following /biz/ for the last month, this coin has been talked about for a while, predictions have been right
you are still in time, just yesterday price was as low as 3.40$...
There will still be plenty of dips through the month before the halvening and btc hardfork to buy, if you wait after December you will be wagecuck forever
feels so so so so good
