We have a 1.0 release right around the corner.. Why the fuck is this doing fuck all?Ive been waiting for this to moon the past 6 fucking months.
MOON WHEN?
!Fuck Sasha that filthy Russian cunt!
Figures..Nobody gives a fuck about waves
their marketing is a jokei feel 90% of people think waves is just "oh thats the one where you can create your own token, cool"i think well see a solid $10 by end of this year and 2018 should be huge if they do what they say they will
They are building an exchange platform for the russian government.
It was in the news MONTHS ago but it never touched the price.Remember crypto market is ADHD on steroids.
Amazing news pumps crazy for 30 min to 1 hour then go back to what it was before the good news.
have you ever used the platform?
[spoiler]its shit[/spoiler]
Waves is really good token, but until they actually implement smart contracts, this shit isn't moving anywhere.
In 6 months we could see a pump to $20 and further, but until then it will most likely reach the $2 bottom again like it did 2 times before.
*coin not token
Other projects jump with good news and Waves did too at times but Waves always and i mean ALWAYS dove straight back to low levels.
Im so tired of it and was hoping Waves 1.0 was gonna be the big break.But nothing is happening!
Fuck Sasha that filthy scum, he doesnt know fuck about making moves in cryptoland.
He is scum.
not if they markethow many people even know waves will have smart contracts?
i feel not manyi like their whole "we will market when said thing to market is ready" but it sucks for investors.the money they got in ICO is insane now considering btc growth and apparently they have a team of 50 people.. but not one of them can advertise their project i guess
Waves can cure cancer, feed all the africans, create world peace, win a grammy, become president, get a free frap from starbucks because it was an extra one and no one would drink it.
And it still wouldn't moon.
