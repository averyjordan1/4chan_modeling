I have 30k I wanna invest.
Been looking at WTC and MOD specifically.
MOD with only 35mill MC seems like the better choice or what?
it went to 40 million and is about x4 from ico...I rode it up and sold it.
Don't think I'll be looking to buy into it again.
Please don't expect it to do what walton did because MOD doesn't have the factors Walton did at the time.
Fair enough.
It has great potential tho, and I could see it going to 100mill marketcap by Q1 2018
You want a well balanced, diversified portfolio: top cryptos (bitcoin, ethereum) that are here to stay, well established coins with potential (NEO, OMG, WTC) and some struggling coins that have a huge potential (Chainlink, ODN).
Do your own research.
nigga I dont want to.
I want to get rich quick.
tell me more about alts and y I should like em
The age of easy 10x ICOs is long gone, enjoy browsing through dozens of new projects popping up every day and guess the few that are gonna get a big pump quickly.
Ambrosus is 10x better than those shitcoins
