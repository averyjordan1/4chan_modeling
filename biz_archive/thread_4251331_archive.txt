That's what your deserve for being a greedy bastard>hurr it's gonna bleed till the forkHAHAHAHA I GUESS IT DIDN"T HAHAHAHOLD IS KING
% LINK% SALTAfter all this fucking JUSTing is it finally my time???
Because Link was just going sideways for ages, I sold at a loss to get into BTC to make small gains so I could buy my Link back cheaper and increase my stack.I increased from 12k to 19k over the week buying and selling Link and BTC, and now I lost most of that.
I got 13k Link now because I FOMO'd in.
I fucking hate this.
Fuck.
KYS AND KILL ME TO
there's still time, anon.
I missed the sub 0.20 link as well.t.
holding bags at 0.34

>Sold 5k LINK at $0.16>Only have 1k LINK leftFugg.
Binance bots finally decided the price could go up again?
gee it's almost like day trading works until it doesn't :^)

I believed in Link and wanted more because I knew I was going to make it.
It just so happened that I was holding BTC when this fucking news came out.
Holy fuck I wanted to buy Link last night as well when BTC was still rising, and my internet went out, so I had to wait till morning.
Holy fucking shit I am mad right now.I believed in this coin but I am too poor to just keeping dumping fiat into it.
I had to daytrade to grow my stack.
God I fucking hate Bitcoin right now.
So you have 1k LINK more than what you started with?
Be grateful you got back in time at all.
>bitcoin drops sub-6000>anons sell btc to buy alts2018 bitcoin surges to 20k>anons buy ATHsuch is the circle of life
After all this fork nonsense I hope Bitcoin goes down to $1 per coin.
Fuck Bitcoin and fuck it's users and developers.
