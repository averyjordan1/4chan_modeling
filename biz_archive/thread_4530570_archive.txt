XMR will be a 1000 dollar coin.
The only reason bitcoin got popular was because of dark markets, and XMR is now the main coin used for that.
Ergo, bitcoin and XMR should be reversed in their priceAgree?
You forgot to mention fungibility.
Coins cannot be considered tainted like the can be with BTC.Furthermore people are beginning to realize Bitcoin allows for your funds to be tracked.
Sending a transaction via the BTC block chain is essentially voluntarily revealing your financial history.
Normies wont show you their bank account balance if asked.
Why would they want there BTC balance and transactions publicly available.The truth is people want a crypto that has an opaque blockchain, is anonymous not pseudonymous, and open source not consolidated by a large corporation.
Dont know about 1k but certainly 300> this time next year
Alphabay and silk road have been shut down.
There won't be anymore dark markets.
Sell your XMR while you still can.
