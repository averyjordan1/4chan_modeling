It takes one whale group to dump some alts and buy BTC and the rest of the market follows.
>$8100HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This kills the Bcash
I remember about a year ago when bitcoin was stuck under 800 for a few weeks.
Almost over night it flew right past 800s into the 900s.
I wonder if it will do the same now into the 9000s.
I'm looking forward to the over 9000 keks.Crazy times.
It's inflated by all the Tether bullshit.
Guys if you are holding significant BTC I highly suggest getting out now.
A very significant amount of BTC's valuation may be nothing more than a fraudulent bubble that has been building for several months.
Many other exchanges are using this bullshit monopoly money as well outside of Bitfinex.
