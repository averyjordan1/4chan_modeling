i bought 1000 SC from Cryptopia and moved it to my SC wallet before the 25th.
Monthly Smartrewards snapshot is due Nov 25.
Last month, the SMART rallied before the date.
Now's the time to buy in.
>p-please buy my bagsYou got scammed by pajeets.
Not buying your shitcoin.
this all hinges on InstantPay
Based on current prices of the moment here's what one would need to do to get in on the compound interest payout.1.
Download SC wallet here: https://smartcash.cc/wallets2.
Sync wallet.3.
Buy 1000 SC @ 669 sats = 0.00669000 BTC (about $54.44 USD) See here for markets: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/smartcash/#markets4.
Transfer SC to wallet.
Be sure you have at least 1000 there.5.
Wait until December 25th6.
Gain payout of 132 SC (see pic related for approximate reward based on October 2017).7.
Wallet now has 1132 SC ($61.67 USD)On the January 25th payout, you would then be gaining interest on the 1132 this time (base + interest).
However, if InstantPay doesn't happen then obviously this coin will be worth shit.See the calculator here: https://smartcash.cc/what-are-smartrewardsRemember, the SC must be in your wallet *BEFORE* the snapshot is taken on the 25th day of the month.
That means if you want to participate in the December 25th payout then you would need to download the wallet right away and start syncing as it may take some time.
I've had this coin staking for months.
These staking rewards are fucking insane desu
