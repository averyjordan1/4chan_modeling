I just found an exploit with a mining pool, i managed to x100 my hashrate.
It's a shitcoin but idc free $$$
care to tell me the exploit and then delete the thread?
more info required
idk man, if many people do it it becomes suspicious and it will probably be shutdown soon
It will be found out eventually.
You shouldn't have made it x100.
Then why the fuck did you make this thread?
Then why come here and post it, retard.>hey guys i found this cool thing that i now wont tell you anything about!
x100 is fine, im in the top but its nothing outstanding.maybe some biztard wants to pay $50 for it.
you can mine it back in some hours, kek.The coin is worth between $1 and $10.
i got 0.4 so far , but i didn't run it non-stop.
under normal conditions i would get like 0.6 per day
220 usd per yearwoah
Seriously I make 2$ a day mining Vertcoin on my gaming rig.
This is some real pleb shit.
lol, and here I thought you were making thousands
that would be nice kek, only ~$5/hr , still $120 per day.
much money for a poorfag like myself
