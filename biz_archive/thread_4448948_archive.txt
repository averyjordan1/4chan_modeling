Convince me fee-only tokens, and those close to it, like ZRX and DNT aren't useless holds?
No matter how awesome the network is I don't see people holding them just because.
If they're used for fees, they eventually have to go up in price as their platform grows in size.
DNT is a shitcoin but 0x could go parabolic after Ethfinex release.
Still, I envision people holding really small amounts and selling once they don't need them.
No incentive to hoard.
