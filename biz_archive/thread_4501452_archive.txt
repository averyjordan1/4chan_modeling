+1there you go now buy the whole market
Thanks my dude, and thanks to the guy who sent me two, now I believe
I am curious bout dis
Not sure if it's a scam, but I appreciate all the effort that is put into these images.
scamit's not scam but it's definitely not a coin to get rich with.
Even if it goes to 0.0001 USD i would still hold these bad boys just for tipping on 4chan.
maybe even buy more then, because who wants to receive a 0.0001 USD tip?it's a community project and i own them not because i want to get those 100x, but to use them for what they've been made for.
It's the idea that counts.
I'll probably get some later today.
Are you guys planning on a Brave extension?
I'm looking at the order book on cryptopia right now.
All that demand.
Jesus, the price is gonna jump again isn't it
I want chinkmoot to really make this the official coin, or at least here on /biz/, and add a tip button to every post.
It woud be funny even if the coin ends up worthless.

I dunno man, the more the coin is visible the more people will see value.
I'm kind of seeing the virality of the coin starting to eminate............plus it's fuckin funny honestly.
I like the memes.
