Fork is over.
Time for icos.
Are you looking into some?
I am investing Ã­n Arktoken and in Bitclave, its a legit project and because they give you tokens based on highest btc rate from desposit till the sale end.
Also works with LTC ETH and Qtum.
Sale start was delayed to be after fork, but could start soon now.
Deposit btc now and you get tokens for atleast the price of 7300$ per btc.
