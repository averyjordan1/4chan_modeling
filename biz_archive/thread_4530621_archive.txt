Fell for the new paradigm meme on ether today and bought at all time high.
BCH is obviously going for a run tonight and so most speculative oppertunists are existing pretty much every coin to get a piece of the BCH cake.
Just like last time, eventually everything came back to these coins.
This is going to happen again right?I could stop loss right now and lose 500$, but I dont mind holding for a month or 2.
Is ETH outlook still bullish in the next few months after the flippening meme ends?
Should I sell or hold for a few months?
