Whyd this stop mooning?
I suspect the price is being actively suppressed by someone who bought a fuckton of BAT in the ICO (at $0.03) and is now selling off his bags piecemeal with a bot that puts up little sell orders just above the market price.Since the price is currently around $0.16, ICO bag dumpers are selling at a huge profit, and this way they can keep selling with less downward price pressure than a huge sell wall would cause.That said, they'll run out of steam eventually.
BAT is just going through a redistribution phase right now.
Should I get in now or wait?
Their direct youtuber payment system went up a few days ago.
If a single major youtuber covers it expect a mega moon.
I would recommend getting in now.
The YouTube news that came out this week are potentially huge HUGE *H U G E*I am holding 800k BAT in hopes that this will blow up beyond belief :)
shit, imagine if jewyoudie covers it.fuuug, so many good tokens, but i don't want to spread too thin.
Get it now.
Brave and BAT already work, it's just the support of the people they're missing.This BAT here
idk.
It died around the time all alts died when korea banned domestic icos and china did the regs they're gonna repeal in a month.
Once eth shoots back up to ~400 it should start moving.also when h3h3 makes a vid telling people to use brave to support his new contentthis sounds really plausiblenow isn't a bad time honestly, should head back to $0.30 easily within next 3-4 months barring anything catastrophic.
> he won't let you pump and dump BAT
