Why is shitcoining so hard, I'm tired of this bs.
Why can't I strike a 3x 5x moon mission :(My biceps are sore already
Lets be honest here.
90% of you fucks have no idea what you are doing.You have zero idea how any of this tech works and you dont actually know what a moon missions looks like.
Your portfolio is pure garbage.Just in this last week you could have 2x-3x THREE TIMES.
ARN, HST and EPY.You buy when they arent on CMC yet, you wait.
as soon as you see 2x-3x you sell.
Rinse and repeat for all this shit coins.You fuckers like being poor
Hint: If it's shilled on /biz/ by multiple people, then IT'S ALREADY TOO LATE
yeah man I sure do love getting dumped on by pajeets and presale whales on ED
my portfolio may be shit but if you managed to pick all those moon missions then YOU ARE the ones making pump and dumps shilling on /biz/ when it's too late already for all of us.fuck off pajeet
if you cant tell the difference between a true long term hold and a PnD then just give up now./biz/ used to be full of actual traders and there are a few left who actually try to help and no one pays attention.Stay poor faggots
long term holdx to 3x in a week for every coinwhat the fuck are you talking about?
what do you think of BLK
this pretty much, shut up faggot
You struck one, hodl salt
It doesn't matter tho.
Expanse is bouncing out of the bottom right now.
Can't go wrong when it's coming off a nice dip like that
