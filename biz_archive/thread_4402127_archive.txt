This shit's Volume is growing hard.What is this coin?
I got airdropped lately on Binance for some reason.People say it's the 3rd stage of Blockchain technology and it's going to be adapted by the mainstream in some time.
Looks pretty scammy to me but it's on #47 on CMC.I could invest 1k into this shitcoin right now, do or don't?>inb4 don't shill other coins in here
I dunno, I own around 110k of it though.bought because why not
that's why people on biz are staying poorand because they take advice from here
Isn't the total supply something insane ?
So the price can't go up too high
wow I just checked binancethe whole trade history is flooded with buy orders
Yeah, it can't go to fucking $1 or something, but 10-20 cents are possible.
That would be 45x-90x the price it is now.
Market cap would be 6'595'090'335-13'190'180'670 (Between Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash right now)
fuck me
