what will happen to alts if Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash flip?
They would rise as people panic sell BTC into alts.
Not until the money pouring into bch first
The good ones could become a safe haven for those unsure about btc/bcash.
Some however may die as their trading pair (btc) is brought to its knees
Bitcoin would become an alt
BCH rises 25% and everyone's freaking out that it's flipping.
The absolute state of this place.
Da Hongfei would shut down every exchange out there, including decentralized exchanges.
He would then call a meeting of "The Big 4" and they would roll back every blockchain to it's genesis block.
They would then begin their project to send one of the A.I.
's back in time to warn our ancestors about the singularity.
It's because its an actual solution and itsn't controlled by (((Segwit))).
Bitcoin Cash gonna take over.
It's the real scaling solution.
Get in now, we're making history.
Aren't there some advantages or something to segwit compared to bch?
it won't it's not, storage is not infinite and the amount of transactions bitcoin "could" be doing with larger amounts of people would cause the blockchain to be huge, meaning data transfer and storage would push the limits and make the network very centralized.
the reason why 1MB blocks exist is because it creates less needs for the network's workers, and its just fine w/ second layer solutions.
its just a matter of adoption.
what happens if it's btg instead?
