Watch closely boys and set some alerts for just past the current price.
We're either going to the moon or this shit is going to dump harder than BCH.

Bittrex is so slow.

Those p&d will be the first thing that gets regulated.
If a coin grows or falls more than x% within a certain period of time trading will get stopped.
Get used to it.
It's going to be a mad dash as soon as it's back online with people trying to pull orders lmao
what happens when this goes back online?
Is it gonna dump?
It would have dumped on other exchanges by now if that was the case.
IT;S BACK AND PUMPING
It's 49k on binance almost 50k so expect it to be the same as binance when its up
It's backBuy buy buy

bittrex NEO market again offline
ok, so now that people can cancel their low ball buy orders they can now buy at a higher fair value market price.
we moonin
Yeah, it went through with the sell unfortunately.
Oh well, to the moon guys
USDT-NEO is up on bittrex but BTC-NEO is not.
it's notthey're just being sour cunts
GUYS BITTREX IS ACCUMULATING.
THEY ALWAYS DO THIS BEFORE A HUGE PUMP.
THIS IS ONLY THE FUCKING START OF THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
Same.
Jesus, I'm going to have a heart attack in a minute.
fuck me, those buy walls
Neo and Eth are the only two cryptocurrencies I've ever given a shit about, watching this feels like watching your son graduate college
Not on decentralized exchanges.
I fucking had a buy bid placed at .0049 when my shit got all glitched upI'd already be up nearly 20% if FUCKING BITTREX HADN'T GLITCHED FUUUUUUUCKKKKKK
>tfw after being throttled to death by chainlink, odn, and bcc and missing out on the first neo mega pump you get to experience happiness again.im starring at these 1,3, and 5 min candles like a hawk.
kek.
it looks like some of your old sell orders are going through.
Why's it dumping!
AHHHHH
so how long does it take to claim one Gas?
I moved my NEO to cold storage and it's already moving up the GAS faster than mining ETC goes.
Small corrections will happen, will Jump back up - this is just people who bought in at 30 leaving with their gains.
We got China coming in an hour Senpai big gains by the time you fall asleep and you'll wake up to fat stacks.
trend is still bullish.
don't worry too much about it.TK cross is just achieved on the 4 hour candles (with obviously a kumo breakout from an hour or so ago), assuming nothing devastating happens to bring us back into the cloud on those candles we can start the real moon mission now.
my only regret on monday will be that I didn't move 100% of my portfolio into NEO, I have a feeling this happened with ETH where some moved 50-70% in during the moon mission for it.
> I buy some Neo> it sells offgod damnit, sorry guys
are these shits gonna get back to .0053 or not
i bought at 537 and sold at 518
ya goofed
already there bruh.
all you had to do was wait
why would you sell during a bull trend.
none of the candles relevant to tonight were bearish or no trend.
ITS OGRE
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA PLEASE I HOPE YOU FOMO'D BACK IN AT 5300 AND SOLD AGAIN AT 5200.
TELL ME YOU DID THIS.
PLEASE.
so I could wait till now to buy the dip and make my money back duuuh
nope I made 100$ back on my loss and sold the peak now gonna buy the bottom again
will it make it to .006?I came very close to selling at .00535 but I got greedy and now it's back down a bit
Is Bittrex givinh GAS for holding NEO?
Newfag here
> CHINA WAKE THE FUCK UP
NO download the NeonWallet to get Gas or move it to Binance, stop using Bittrex it's horrible, lags all the time and costs me Money
