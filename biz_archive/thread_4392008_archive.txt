i sure hope you bought the dip.QTUM has some serious support today, a lot of korean money moved in earlier (as it moved out of BCH) and it seems to be holding.
Tomorrow we may see an all time high.
It's not only the Korean money, anon.
Chinks are back, are you seeing Hshares?
Qtum will get a similar pump in 4 days.
The volume is coming from 'hidden' Chinese exchanges which are not visible in CMC yet.
ya good point with the Hshares comparison
