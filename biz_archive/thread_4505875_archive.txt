Anyone know of a good platform for trading that doesn't require bank identification or that is pretty much anonymous?
Something that anyone could jump into without identification?
if you're buying bitcoin, not really.
If you already have bitcoin there are a few that don't need verification or require some basic verification
What about if all you have is dogecoin?
Cryptopia.
It is also not heavily manipulated by bots.
