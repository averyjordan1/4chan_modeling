fuck my ass, it already pumped 70%yeah still 50% under ico, but i doubt it'll go much higher than ico pricethey raised like 60 million dollars at the icotbqh if i were an agrello backholder i'd find an exit point and just give up on this mess of a coin
get in or cry poor with doggo

Pumped?
They just listed BNB and BTC pairing 3 hours ago.
Don't think you know the definition of pumping my friend.
sell the newsdo you know how to pump?to be honest though, I don't know if this was news anyone knew about, but based on the volume that was picking up.
yeah.
maybe someone did
This was not "News" - there was no "Rumor"...Comfy AF over here.
Just wait
i bought at 12 cent and my sell order at 20 was filled, comfy even if it could go higher.
i bought many in ICO too, but i think this project failed hard, alex norta left and said he would do this with phd students on his own now
Failed?
How did this project fail when it's just getting started.
BTW your missing out on gains as we speak.
Normies flooding to Binance
because the chief scientist left ?
because they failed at releasing the tokens properly ?
because their communication just sucks ?choose one
theres no normies that uses binance, they use coinbase at bestdont be delusional, dont be a bagholder, admit defeat and move onstop be so fucking emotional towards your dumb coins, we are here to make money, not cling unto failed projects that never will go anywhere
