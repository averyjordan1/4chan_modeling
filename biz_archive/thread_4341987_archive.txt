Can nocoiners/shitcoiners ever learn the simple rule of buying the dip?
Will they buy the current dip?
When you wait 2hrs for a dip but the coin keeps rising, the second you buy it starts to go sideways 2 minutes later they drop to the ground... sigh story of my life.After you're too scared so when you see BCH rise and rise you go "fuck that I'm not falling for it today" and you miss 200% :(
Just buy the current BTC dip.
BCash has no fundamentals beyond muh flippening.
>sold at 7500>bought at 5900For once I finally did it.
How do I make sure it's the dip and not the beginning of the crash?
It's impossible to know... just buy when it has a good dip.
You can't never be 100% accurate.
am i supposed to buy the bitcoin dip or the bitcoin cash dip?
Ok I am retarded.
But I have cash ready for btc.Let's say I buy now but due to chinky fuckery my btc only arrives tomorrow.
The price won't change right, if I pay 6300 now and it is 6700 (or 2000) by the time I finally get it the price I paid is 6300 correct?
Yes, but that depends on the terms and conditions of your exchange in any case.
