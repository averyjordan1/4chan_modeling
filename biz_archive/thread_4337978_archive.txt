At this point I don't think it's going for $6300 ever again, but you might still want to wait until it falls back there to buy, it seems that most of the money are waiting for the ~6000-6300 to buy in, so expect a rapid rise of value around ~6200.
3...2...1... (seriously)
6200 was a resistance level during the last bounce, I think we will test that again to confirm upward movement.
