I don't understand what this copypasta pic is trying to convey?That Amazon is way bigger and syscoin won't make it?Or....?
They are trying to imply that the SYS market cap could one day be as high as Amazon's.
This is one of the stupidest comparisons I have seen on this board.
SYS hopes to eventually compete with AWS, not Amazon.com.
Showing the chart for the entire company just demonstrates that OP is another low-effort, low-intelligence shill.

Well not to mention that SYScoin can do cool shit, like real estate bidding.
And stuff you could probably never buy on Amazon...
