I have just stored 17500 Link into my Ledger+Mew wallet.
I also deleted blockfolio and erased crypto updates from my phone.If I forget about crypto and check this again exactly one year from now, how rich will I be?
quite rich
Less, as a law was passed that anyone buying shit ICO's had to compensate everyone else for seeing their posts in public.Also, your Link is less then than it was now.
1 year passes>you finally check the price>its at .08 cents>week before it was at $95
Lmao
you'll have useless coins, you'll be like the people who did this for Confido and are coming back next month only to find its been removed from the Exchanges - if you really want to do this, DUMP your Link and jump on BQX, I promise you in 1 year from now you'll be $100,000 richer at the very least.
comparing LINK to Confido.
delet this.
i'm going to laugh if it's exactly the same price as today in a year.
LINK is a Scam you fool 2 Devs and nothing is happening BQX has the potential to hit 100+ in 2 years (now ETHOS)
m8, just set a blockfolio alert for k sats or something.
that way you'll be able to sell on top of the fomo wave, if that ever happens.
All those deluded no-linkies.
Always thinking about Link.
Scared they miss the moon mission.
One tweet of Sergey that PoC with SWIFT was succesful and this is instantly 1 Billion Marketcap.
Inverse Confido.> Live forever rent-free in your head.
Just upped my stack to 20k.
$17,500 or about $170
I too also shat on the floor and called it wealth.
link only $1 after a yearhow delusional are you, nolinkie?
I thought sibos was the poc with swift?
I thought link was meant to hit $5 back then?What happened?
Not as delusional as you fucks who adamantly thought it would be $1 *before* SIBOS LMAO XD
I made dis.LINK $5 2Q 2018
It's a pretty elaborate scam if sohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW27zYIxZhYLol let's work for years on a unique and interesting project in a rapidly growing market and get industry exposure from SWIFT then just disappearIt would be easier to just do the thing for real lol
sergey giving presentations on tons of prestigious blockchain conferences in front of extremely important and rich people>lol it's a scam!
just like CONfido!ignoring the fact that we've NEVER seen any of the CONFIDO team members in person and if link turned out to be a scan sergey would go to prison for 100 years yeah it's a scam I guess
It would be easier to just do the thing for real lolkek
