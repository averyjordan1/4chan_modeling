I made 55 ETH from 17ETH during the BCH rush yesterday night.
BCH is at 1000 right now... should I go all in with my 55 and try to turn it into 100 ETH?
I made 10 Dogecoins from 1 Dogecoin
I think it's too dangerous.
There's got to be a better way anon.
That's just gambling.
You may get lucky but if it was me I'd maybe put the 17 eth you started with into it if you actually think this is a good entry point.
fuck yes anon, even if it doesn't pump tonight just watch it this week.
You will turn profit if you buy in now.
I'm actually already a multimillionaire trust fund kid so I'll probably just throw it all in and hope for a massive victory.My parents bestowed upon me 3 rental properties so far which generate me about 11k of income a month, which is net since they pay all the taxes and HOA fees through their company.I use the money I make from bitcoin for drugs and hookers, it's awesome and I don't feel bad spending my parent's money on degenerate bullshit.
