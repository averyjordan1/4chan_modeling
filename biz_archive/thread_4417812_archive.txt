I already run Adsense.
But how much would a big business pay for a banner or something?
I get over 10,000 views per week.
Has anyone done this?
How much should I charge
Turn that into couple mil views a week and then people will talk to you.
LOL ok yeah no worries I'll just go right ahead and do that.Pretty sure only the top sites would get that kind of traffic
Bump.
Anyone??
