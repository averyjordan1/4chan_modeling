Assuming you're talking about crypto just select the one with the most volume in the last 24 hours and read the chart by 1 minute updates if it isn't volatile go for the next largest volume.
Repeat till you find one thats the most volatile with high volume
Pick a crypto that goes up 10% then sell.
That way you'll make 10% tonight.
0 risk>high volatility
