Can I convince my bank to give me a month long 250000$ mortage then I can just pay them back while making money with crypto?I have a wage cuck job but I need more money now faster to put into some coins.
How do I go about this?
You're a moron if you would do this
I'm gonna piggy back on this post and ask if I can take out a massive student loan, transfer funds to Gemini, and just buy btc and avoid next semester of school.
I have 0 student loan debt and my credit is clean.
Surley this student loan bubble will pop sooner than Im obligated to pay back the loan, right?????
Even if the loan bubble remains, hyperinflation will ease the insane interest rate they tack on.
Just seems like a dumb move to NOT buy btc by any means right now.
tell the bank the house you want to buy is only accepting BTC so you need to convert it to buy
>Hey Anons.
have yall heard about that one guy thart mortgaged his 250.000 appartement and put it all in crypto, losing 150K in 3 weeks?
m8 doing things like this is only viable if you're already loaded and want more money and its doesn't matter if you have to pay the loan back without gains cause you're already mega rich
can I convince the bank to give me a month long mortgageNo
And what will you say when btc is 1 million in 2020?
"Dang shoulda taken out that mortgage, you'd be rich rn anon :p"
