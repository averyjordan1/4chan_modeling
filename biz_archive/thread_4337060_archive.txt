Why is everything green again?
What is going on?
This is the first time I've felt out of the loop in a long time.
BTC fork is offBCH pump is in its death throesPeople are moving their funds around trying to get a discount
What happens when Bitcoin drops?
Altcoins rise.
That's why BCH is falling as the alts rise.
BCH will rise again in a bit and the alts will start going down again as well as BTC.
People realize money is slowly flooding out of bitcoin and into more prized coins and projects.
