this fucking coin.news and updates every single day.. ive been researching and their team and partnerships look amazing.think I should wait for dip or get in now?
my buy order has been at 45 all day but not filled
I bought more at $3.60.
You could probably get cheaper if you waited, or just pull the trigger now because soon the $3 range will be history.
.6-3.7 are safe buys
