Post Ark memes.
The two most deluded memes get two Ark each.
Possible bonus for amazing OC.
I'm the only OP that delivers because I know that Ark is going to deliver me someday and I'm passing on the gift in advance.

Random Ark questionDoes buying a hardware Ledger for it make it more secure?
I don't want to lose my Ark somehow.
don't seee how.
If someone can guess your pneumonic they can access your account from anywhere.
Pretty sure cahcnes of someone guessing your pneumonic are zero and you can buy a second passphrase so it's like an 18 random word password to do any transfers which should be about as secure as you can get
Here ya go, m8.AGgQA9jrhk95qdVuQ2xKVXqbDenMXcnx4y
That's true.
Thanks again for all the Ark, man.Reminder to all you anons to print your pass phrase out and put it in a secure place, or encrypt it with a password with 7zip on multiple hard drives.
it's a mnemonic and the odds aren't quite zerp
Yeah, but the odds are like 1 in 10 trillion.
People can get into regular bank accounts just by guessing and answering security questions
4462420Not quite zip but just divide 1 by that number in pic related and you can see how close to 0 it is.
Nice to see my OC out in the wild hehe
