Is there any light/web ethereum wallet?
Turns out I don't have enough space on hard drive to store blockchain
ark
Electrum.
isn't that only for bitcoins?
The ethereum wallet has a beta light wallet mode, don't know if it still makes you download the blockchain
Exodus, no doubt
or myetherwallet.
kind of complicated but just keep trying it out til you get it.
It makes you download blockchain at the beginning of installation, so it won't workThanks lad, myetherwallet looks pretty good
