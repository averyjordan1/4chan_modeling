Secure nodes move to mainnet on Nov 30, followed by a rebranding in the coming months.You will never see it below $30 again, I can guarantee that.Look at recent Monero, DASH, Zcoin and even ZEC pumps.People make a grave mistake of thinking there can only be 1 of any type of coin in the crypto space.
There is always room for more and you will all be FOMOing HARD when ZEN starts hitting 3-400m market cap, then you'll think it's "too late" when it breaks 500m.
Then by the time it's 1 billion you'll be telling your friends about how "you could have".
Love zencash its by far the best privacy coin.I have 10 secure nodes ready.But - 3.5% ROI?
Câ€™mon daddy.
Ten secure nodes?
So you have 420 Zen?
