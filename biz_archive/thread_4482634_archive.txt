If anybody can send me 1 ARK I would be very much gratefulARdBwRdBjL3KCdwDpH31oU5qmoANfQsi65
 herehow much more I need to make it?
You’ll be doing fine.
The more the better of course.
my goal was around 4k~, preferably 5 to ensure that 1 ark per day stakinghopefully I make it next year before we go nuclear
Can’t wait to use my ARK as my main bank account while the bitcucks have their BTC stuck in their wallet when it gets ‘hacked’ and they get left with nothing.
