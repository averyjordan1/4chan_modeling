How do restaurants ever go bankrupt?
The restaurant I work at nets 350k a year... if they were competent at all they could invest that into crypto and makes millions and even buy another restaurant
Are you serious?
restaurants go bankrupt faster and more often than any kind of physical outlet
restaurants fail like 60% of the time
How do restaurants ever go bankrupt?Seasonality.Low profit margins despite high cashflow.Loads of competition (Other restaurants, cafes, McDonalds, Uber Eats and home delivary, Grocery stores and home cooked meals...).
Constantly changing Supply Chain ("Oh those Mushrooms are out of season, now what do we put on the menu?
")Not to mention how stressed and sexually frustrated kitchen staff are.if they were competent at all they could invest that into crypto and makes millions and even buy another restaurantYou're an idiot.
How rich are you if Crypto is so lucrative and easy when already running a business?
Have you checked the expenses?
sexually frustrated kitchen staffwhat?
nets
In a tight, hot kitchen they're bumping around constantly yelling at each other and stress is building up, gotta vent it somehow
I've worked in 4 restaurants with my Dad.Can confirm.
sexually frustrated>with my Dad.Checks out
What  this guy says.
But also the hours are a lot like nursing, it's very difficult to maintain a relationship or a regular booty call.
Also food is sensual for a lot of people.PHRASING!
how many partners though?
how many pax a day?
also is the exception rather than the rule, most restaurants would be making % margin
Labour and leases, anon.
