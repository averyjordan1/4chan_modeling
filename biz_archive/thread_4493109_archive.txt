Is there any way to measure distance(similarity) between keywords?
(For exampleWhen I define distance as 1(very close), 2(far), 3(very far), 0(same).
I would be able to say Banana - Vanana(typo) = 0.Banana - Banana Snack = 2.Banana - Bunny Sanders = 3.
Is there any similar system to calculate distance between keywords?
Any information appreciated.
