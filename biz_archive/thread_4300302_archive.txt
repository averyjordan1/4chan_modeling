so, personally im not a big fan of marijuana and think its pretty degeneratehowever, i was thinking: what if you made a marijuana bank?you buy a decent sized vault, and you store peoples marijuana in it for a small fee, like 10 bucks a monthwhenever they want a withdrawal, they call you and you pull out their storage, weigh out the amount they want, package it and deliver it to themobviously, this is more of a local business, and it isn't exactly legal, but i feel itd be a viable strategyany thoughts?
good luck getting random people to hand over their weed to you
Marijuana don't age wellAlso bank seeds already exist
Well, like i said, itd be a pretty local business where people already know youThe idea behind it is that they wont have to worry about search and seizure, because itll all be safely tucked away
what's to stop a search and seizure from happening at this business ?
he doesn't know the orange peel trick
Makes no sense.
A random persons house with < 1oz is alot less likely to be raided than a business intended for the specific purpose with significantly more in its possession.
Notable member of the community with upstanding record is a lot less likely to get raided than a punk druggie, im sure
ohhh cringe, what a retard.
Enjoy your mold.
Meanwhile people that actually know what they are doing use Boveda packs and humidity sensors.

dumb idea.
smoke more weed and get creative
And if the police catches on, which they will... You just lost everyone's weed and your credibility
Freezer works fine too

not a fan of marijuana>lets capitalize on marijuana by making a bank that can't be FDIC insuredgood luck, retardo.
