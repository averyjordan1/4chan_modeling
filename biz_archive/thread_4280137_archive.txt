Remember why were on /biz/ and not /g/.We dont give a shit about the nerds arguing over the bitcoin formula.We didnt get into crypto because we wanted to be a part of "the block chain revolution" or any of that shit.We're here for one reason, and one reason only.To make money.If bitcoin cah flippens bitcoin... A huge oppertunity to earn more money pops up.
Why would you hate an oppertunity to make money?Im holding bitcoin cash because i think its gonna go up a whole lot, much more than bitcoin will in the next couple of months anyway.
Do what you think will make you the most money.
