In hindsight you should have bought Super coin 1 week ago.https://coinmarketcap.com/gainers-losers/
2 summers ago you could have bought NAUTilus for 1-3k sats and in 2 months sold it at 150k sats for a 50-150x return.
This march you could have bought Bitcoin Plus and even longed it before it 50x the initial price out of a sudden.
Isn't Groestl an obvious pick?Listed on normie exchange, and for the life of me I can't figure it out what kind of decision was made to pump that piece of shit TEN FUCKING X over 4-5 days....just a few days ago.It was pretty hard to get into Confido ICO since it was sold out in a minute, but holy shit Grostl shit was there for the pickings.Still feel gutted about that shit.
Why are 99% of low marketcap coins note abused to hell and back for easy gains from 10$ to 1000$?
or 1$ to 100$ for cheap kids who need lunch money.Most low marketcap coins are inactive and only very very few of them like Chaincoin rise from 1 sat to 5000-12000 satoshi's and end up with a temporary 42 million marketcap at the peak.
