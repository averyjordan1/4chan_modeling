Going back to 10 today
Why didnt I buy more at $6.20
I never doubted
Now I am become comfy
I wanted to so bad... i had no money left to put :(
I bought earlier this year at $9.I sold at $5.80 for some BCH to sell a few days before fork and buy back into OMG.This fork cancellation fucked me in the ass, hard.
I ended up selling my BCH when it was low for ETH while it was high.
I'm a fucking meme.
I was going to buy yesterday but got lazy and just went to sleep.
