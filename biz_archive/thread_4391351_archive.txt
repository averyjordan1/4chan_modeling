Econ 101 tells us that price is determined by supply vs demand.
If there is an imbalance price moves until an equilibrium is reached.
Now Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins but core are geniuses and have figured out a way to reduce that number without a fork and thus reduce supply.
Once you could have spent five dollars worth of Bitcoins but as the fees keep going higher it will eventually becomes impossible to send those five dollars worth of Bitcoins because the transactions fee would be more than five dollars worth of Bitcoins.
As fees keep going up more and more transactions effectively become unusable and get removed from supply.
By allowing for transaction fees to keep going up core are enriching the whale HODLers at the expense of the poorfags!
Brilliant!
Bravo!
