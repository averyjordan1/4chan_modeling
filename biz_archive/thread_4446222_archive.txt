where can i buy crypto without getting cucked?
im new to the game, i'm willing to throw 50 bucks, any suggestions ?
50 bucksyoure gonna get cucked with fees, poor boy
 bucksYou need a 500-1000 cash minimum
i know, where do yall niggas exchange n shit?
i can do 500, i just want something to invest in and then not look for 1-2 years
Gdax has no maker fees.
cool, isn't it related to coinbase?
also what if i want to buy some shitcoin in the hope they will moon someday?
Gemini.
I buy at cex.ioLast time I bought ETH from market order I got cucked hard and bought it at $390 instead of then relevant $280
4446363so this are the bigger players, what if i want to buy some shitcoin like nuls, neo, link?
Yes it's coinbase's backend.
Coinbase buys and sells appear as taker orders on Gdax.For alts use Binance, cryptopia.co.nz, poloniex, or bittrex.
You still need ETH or BTC to buy any other alts, because there are no $/LINK etc pairs on alt-exchanges
