>Buttcoin fork proposed>It goes up 2k>Buttcoin fork canceled>It's starting to go up another 2kI'm so confused.
I think many other market participants were expecting a drop after the fork, therefore, they held back their reserves for such time.
Now that it seems it isn't going to happen, reserves are now being deployed towards pumping btc.
All the money that was in B2X futures now all must go 100% to BTC.
keep chasing shitcoinsnothing personel kids
Nothing makes sense.
Short term crypto is a pure gamble.
nolong term crypto other than BTC is a pure gamble
