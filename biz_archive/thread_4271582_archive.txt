>BTC crashing down>ETH mooningWhat a time to be alive
The normies are diversifying.
Homura 
It's a good thing the market reacts so strongly to the arbitrary whim of whoever decides to fork bitcoin every fucking quarter.
Ether barely goes over 300ITS MOONING GUISE BUTTCOINERS ON SUICIDE WATCH>Meanwhile ether slowly bleeds back to sub 300 and stagnatesW-whales are accumulating t-this is a consolidation phase!Like clockwork.
flippening EOY!!!
Kikecoin is the one that bleeds.
Fucker takes 2 hours to do a transaction and over $40 a fucking coin.
I can move any variable of ETH for a few cents and within 30 seconds.
Get fucked.
Crashing down>nothing happened
It is crashing down since the fork cancellation dumbass.
It will gradually go down even more in the following days.
Lower highs and lower lows time to get out.
