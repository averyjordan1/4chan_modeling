Pic related.So I got into the open beta today and have to say the exchanges view is decent, not amazing.
However it has a ton of features for margin trading, 0% fee's, bots.On top of all that, all ico's they host including cybermiles earns cobholders free ico tokens.> Legitimately think this DEX could beat binance.> Legitimately don't see why cob is 7 cents> Cob is over $1 on the beta>> The founder of cobinhood is already pretty huge and successful>> Time to set all these pink wojacks aside and make bank.
