Very comfy hold.
Can't wait to see this thing hit top daily on CMC
Picked up 1000 of these.
Price has dropped a bit since but I don't care because I want to hold these till the project is complete.
Same.
Could be interesting real soon.
Predicted sell order?
I'd like $25
I think it's gonna take a while to hit that, maybe 6 months.
But I do think it will hit that for sure.
