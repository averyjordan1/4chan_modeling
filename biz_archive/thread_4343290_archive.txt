There are currently 3 projects that could make some good returns over the next few weeks.Link - Well, Laurel & Hardy forgot the language so we need to wait.
Hardy has been way too quiet so he must be working on something.
In my opinion something will leak soon.Nuls - Nice spike today, but the real pumping should start tomorrow and should carry over the next 7 days.
Now is probably the best time to get in, when token price is less than $1.00.WTC - Testing in progress, should moon around December time, once wallet is released.Good luck All.
I hope everyone will make some nice returns in time for Christmas.
op is troll he's even saying it in his picture.
don't listen to him.
btw nuls is a vaporware scam coin used for pump and dump.
you got me.
stay poor
