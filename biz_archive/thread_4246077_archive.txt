It's okay, I've set unrealistically high standards for girls AND have a passive, self-defeating attitude possibly as a way to evade responsibility for having to marry and take care of kids because I'm mentally immature and deathly afraid of actually fetting close to another human being by making myself believe I'm somehow hated by the entire other sex.
I'm so ahead of the curve that I will never even have to worry about marriage being a bad deal for me.
only in the US ?
I dunno, I just spent the week in Mexico drinking tequila with my beautiful wife while we checked out hot Latina babes in g strings prancing around on the beach.
Sold 150k worth of POT the other day and cashed out some BTC, it just hit my bank account and we’re about to buy a beach condo here, totally by surprise (thanks POT).
She told me she wants to “fuck a hot Latina in the ass while she eats out her pussy” on the balcony the break in our new place...
I dunno being married is pretty cool.
