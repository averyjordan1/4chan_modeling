Up 15% 20% 55% on various coins like NEO UBQ POWR SUB etc... Should I just sell?
yes, fuck all those shitcoins and re-invest profits into ETH
no...
take out your original investment and hodl the rest long term
Nice, would racemix/10
how much BTC for a bf like this
she
even better
hnnnnnnnnggggggg
More of her please.
U have a set?
Taking out original investment is the gayest normie thing you can do
Sell it all for BTC before it moons again.
Don't be stupid and lose all those sweet gains
Hold NEO for at least 2 days.
UBQ is a long hold for me.
thisliterally the worst investing advice you can give
