I warned you faggots a hundred times this piece of shit is propped up by overleveraged greedy fucks thinking they can all close together at the same time and that this was inevitable throughout this entire bull run, but some fucking retarded cucks STILL bought >$6000...and on fucking marginRemember all those people doing "huge shorts" all the way up while permabulls (who joined within the last couple months) were getting mad at them for "suppressing the price"?
