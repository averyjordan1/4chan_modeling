Hi i'm new to the cryptocurrency trading and i want to know what the best exchange/trading website is.
And if you want you can also share the best unknown/cheap crypto currency that will most likely have a price increase and are 'safe' to invest in.
(Ex.
Verge, very very cheap imo and read that it will most likely reach 0.1 or even 1.0 next year)
Since now i only have cryptopia.co.nz and bittrex.com as websites which seem kinda trustworthy...
