Literally EVERYTHING but BCH is in the red right now on CMC.
Further, BCH isn't even climbing.
This fucking gook loving shills and chink thieves are stealing from EVERYONE and CHASING OFF NORMIE money that was flowing like fucking fine wine.
FUCK CHINA AND FUCK YOU BCH SHILLS QUEERS
Buy bch and stop crying?It's skyrocketing now1010$ and going up and upGet in now or cry later
Its all those segwit kikes fault
No lying dumbfuck, it's NOT skyrocketing, it's actually down since I posted 1 minute ago.
heavily invested in something else and can't pull out without admitting losses?
Sucks to be you.
Don't worry, within the week this BCH shit will flop like it always does.BTC is the king.
I want to get into alts.
what would be a good spread?
That's just it, no one knows.
This BCH shit might in on Sunday when BCG launches.
It might not end until Monday when the BCH hard fork happens and even then, the hard fork might lead people to say "now BCH is even better" and then it continues to stagnate EVERYTHING until it doesn't.
This is why I'm mad.
There's literally no way to play this right.
Even getting out into fiat from BTC could easily be wrong - if BCH starts to crash, BTC will go on a FUCKING LEGENDARY RUN.
cool we need I've got a lot running on this haven't lost anything yet thanks for the detailed answer.
OMG, NEO, ARK, ADA
