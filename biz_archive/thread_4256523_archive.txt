So why exactly should I be buying this?
Is this a scam?
yes
you shouldnt, you should buy EDO$3 by tonight $5 tomorrow
any news coming up?
partial exchange release soonand the team posts an article every 2/3 days
In my experience scams have been good.
Not to mention it has a decent team and a low marketcap.
Can you spoon feed shill that to me?
Just want to make sure you're no pajeet pump and dumper.
Just read up on this a bit.
Why should I buy this over something like COSS, BinanceCoin, or Kucoin which already have exchanges?
