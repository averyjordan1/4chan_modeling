I think we will see above 7600 in no time.
This time tomorrow probably new ATH
this is true but in all my discords and telegram groups no one likes to believe me.
I think BTC will pump to ATH now from all the alt profits.
Meanwhile, BItcoin Cash is about to moon..
maybe that's because the universe is indeterministic and therefore there's actually no way to know what will happen in the future
the universe is indeterministicProve it
sorry, I can't prove it as there's always a case against indeterminism.
you could argue that indeterminism just means that we're missing some variable causing the illusion of chaos, and at the core the universe is deterministic.The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle would strongly point towards indeterminism though
Nah, what's going to pump BTC is more and more institutional money coming in.
S2X getting shot down cleared a lot of potential uncertainty, and we're very likely going to see ETF approvals soon now that there are futures/options markets available.
I think we will see below 5600 soon.
This time tomorrow probably lowest point in months.
no forks is good for bitcoin, and for the overall crypto market, makes the price rise naturally instead of massive pump and dump fests at every memeforkand no-coiners btfo as per usualhere's to another march-july gain rally
