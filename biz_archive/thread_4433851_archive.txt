https://audioboom.com/posts/5905753-157-the-most-important-economic-question-of-our-timeGuy discusses whether or not the supply of money is limited or unlimited.
His thesis that it is not limited due to government and CB capabilities is not wrong.
They can create whatever whenever.
However, he doesn't seem to view this negatively and makes the case that increased government spending does not act to siphon off available money/spending elsewhere (read: private sector).
I agree with him technically on the supply issue.
Where he seems to go full retard is in ignoring how government spending/debt results in currency devaluation OR in taxes needed to keep debt under a level that will trigger inflation.
Economic activity reduced via siphoning off actual money through taxes or through destroying the value of currency.Or am I the fucking idiot?
