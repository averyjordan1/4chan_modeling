What was ico price
i bought in right at the end which was roughly 1 eth = 425 dcorpfirst day was 1 eth = 625 dcorpi couldnt tell you the price of eth at the time but it was post bancor ico (remember when it plummeted and never returned to $400?)
also about fucking time
like around $0.60most recent price on cryptopia is now like $3... low volume, but that's just cause we're only just now starting
I bought 220 of them... whats a reasonable sell price?
Also should i switch from ED?
