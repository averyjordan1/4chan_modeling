It... seems legit actually.I'm holding Ark anyway so a nice bit of news.
Thanks anon.

I mean, the Ark team themselves announced it so it's definitely legit.They got listed on Binance last week too

4263323Now that I've bought some Ark, what exactly should I do with it?I've heard about staking, but is there actually any profit in it and how does it work?
It's 10% annually, but of course you can set payouts to daily/weekly so it grows exponentially.
There are calculators out there which delegate pays how much.
ah for staking you need the ARK wallet, just read about it on ark.io and the ark reddit how it works
https://classicdelegate.biz/faqhere u go mang enjoy your arkcoin
i already have arks but not sure if i should buy more
Same, I wish I had gotten more in yesterday or last week
I think you misunderstood the announcement.
What they said was that it's their 2nd large chinese exchange after binance.
Not that this new one is the 2nd largest.
If you trade on an alt coin exchange that doesn't have ark listed, consider sending them an email or request ticket, even if you think the exchange isn't the best, the exposure is important.
Few examples:https://liqui.io/https://www.livecoin.net/https://hitbtc.comhttps://bitbay.net/https://poloniex.comhttps://allcoin.com/https://wex.nz/https://yobit.net (has a surprisingly large volume on certain coins like Lisk and Waves)https://www.bitcoin.co.id (Indonesian exchange)https://bx.in.th/ (Thailand exchange)Start small with these exchanges and as this coin grows we can get ambitious with higher volume exchanges.
