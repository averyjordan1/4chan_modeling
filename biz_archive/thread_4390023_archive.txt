The Bitcoin Cash pump and dump last weekend was epic.
I made 200% gains and didn't held for the maximum 400% gains but I digress.Where do these chinks get the funds to manipulated bithumb like that?
We we burgers sending too much money over there by buying samsung and kia?
FOMO and coordinated shill got the worst out of people.
When I saw they buy at 0.3--.5, it was like WTF to me.
They deserved to lose money tho.Remember never bought after a vertical long green stick, you may gain some but most of the times, it will fall within minutes and you wont even be able to sell fast enough.
what did the plastic surgeons mean by this?
The Chinese miners have been using the korean exchanges due to the China exchange issue.
There's no way that huge pump came from Mom and Pop people.
