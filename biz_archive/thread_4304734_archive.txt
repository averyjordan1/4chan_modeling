Is it true that Bitcoin Cash is actually Bitcoin because it didn't change from the start?
No, stop believing the propaganda.
This is a scare tactic by stupidy rich people in the community.
BTC unlimited is NOT BTC Core.
BCH is going through a huge pump and dump.
Buy the dip anon, or ETH stay away from BCH
If you haven’t profited by now, you’re not going to
Bitcoin Cash is the real bitcoin as described in Satoshi's whitepaper.
Admittedly it also has EDA but that is being removed in 2 days with a hard fork.

Bitcoin is always the longest chain with the greatest proof of work.
If Bitcoin Cash succeeds in overtaking the legacy chain, Bitcoin Cash will become Bitcoin.
At present that hasn't happened, but will if price momentum keeps up.
BTC is now known as Segwitcoin Only because Salt was already taken
Literally from the guy himself:@JihanWu>Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

@JihanWuJihan Wu Retweeted Gavin Andresen>No, Bitcoin Cash should either remain forever as Bitcoin Cash, or if it needs to rename itself, it can be some other good, but not Bitcoin.https://twitter.com/JihanWu/status/926076475656126466
This is what's actually happening anon:- Smart money buys 'insert your flavor of the month here' while it has momentum.
At this moment we are talking about Bitcoin Cash- They dump it to fiat because Bitcoin is unstable right now and it just hit an all time high way too fast.- Finally, they buy the Bitcoin dip while providing support at a more rational price for Bitcoin, around 6k, even though it could dip some more.You're welcome.
thank you, whats up with all the fud on bitcoin dying?
