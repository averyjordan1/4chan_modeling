What advantages does BCH have over ethereum for transactions?
Especially after POS is implemented?
Less anonymous, more centralized, can't do shit else other than make useless Chinese miners money.
They took something made a generic copy of it, and tried to steal market share with the generic version.
Its literally the most Chinese strategy there is.
Ethereum is better.
That's why BCH needs to cause the flippening vs BTC so people get out of their "Bitcoin can't be flipped" hypnosis, as well as expose the cancer that is miner politics to the world and thus how awful both BTC and BCH are, as well as showing the destinity of all other POW coins.The flippening paves the way for a second flippening where Ethereum overtakes BCH.
I wonder what happened to him
Your dumb racist argument is retarded and wrong though.
BCH is the vastly better fork between it and BTC.
They're both shitcoins, however.
He tried to transact himself from the street to his home but it cost him his liver and he died.
