What is the best Exchange to buy neo and when will it be around $28 dollars again??
I think this coin has potential, not overly shilled like link, but shilled by the chinese just enough to make me interested.
I am a coinbase fag, only been on /biz a few weeks, want to know most friendly wallet, software, and most user friendly exchange to buy it with..
Thank You.

Bittrex, given you already own some BTC.
$28 dollars againThat is like asking when will ETH be $5 again
Binance and Bittrex are both good.
You will need BTC first then trade it for NEO.
Make sure to withdraw it to a wallet(neon is good) if you want to earn gas.
Why do people think that the Chinese are deep in Neo?
Apparently it has piss poor reception over there.
It's just us amerifats trying to make money.
Or just leave it on Binance.
They distribute your gas monthly.
It was around 28 for 3 fucking months.Now its up 30% and u want in.
Lol
Bittrex or Binance.
But it's not going to $28 bud
Bittrex, but you are also going to need a time machine to get Neo at $28.
Lmao Bud as said earlier found Biz 2 weeks ago, didnâ€™t hear anything about Neo untill a few days ago.
Will this coin moon again?
https://www.kucoin.com will pay your GAS dividends daily
Bittrex is a piece of shit, use Kucoin or Binance
Binance and Kucoin pay you GAS.Bittrex doesn't and has higher fees.
sign up at Binance not Bittrex (Bittrex is slow as fuck) Send your LTC to Binance and sell it for BTC then use that to buy NEO - do it quick is going to moon to $90 by Monday
