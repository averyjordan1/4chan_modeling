The industry is waking up to POSW.
Things are moving.
Don't get FOMO in a month and wish you bought in October.You get dividends every month just from holding.
The dividends come in the form of more shares.
Every month your dividends compound on top of your dividends.Buy low (now).Hold.Let that shit compound for a while.Sell High, or let it keep compounding.
Okay
The train left weeks ago.
The train hasn't even gotten out of 1st gear yet.The fuck are you smoking?
This and Coss are going to blow up
I am so excited but nervous about Coss.
If it gets even decent volume (1 million USD/day) I would get like 50 ETH per week in dividends.
They just need to revamp the UI, add fiat trading pairs, and start marketing a bit and it'll take off.
Can you please tell me what POSW is?
Why would you get 50 eth's per week?
dividend>listed on a big exchangePick one
POSW already got shilled in the summer f@g. Stop trying to make newfags lose money
dividend on cryptos = complete total bullshit this is just another scam coin, move along
Damn, how much Coss are you holding, felliw COSSdresser?
4259699Sorry my math was a little off.
It'd be ~16 ETH per week at 1 million USD per day trading volume... still enough to easily live on lol.
I have 210,000 COSS.
Pump and dump well past the terminal dump phase.Avoid at all costs.Piece Of Shit
