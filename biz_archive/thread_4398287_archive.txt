>having a job
how else am I supposed to make money
KEKKKKKKK THE ABSOLUTE STATE OF WAGIES
Not pretending to still be broke (on paper) and living in a homeless shelter on government benefits while hoarding more than 400~ Bitcoin that you mined early 2010 so as to further destroy a system you do not believe in Casual
A man goal should be to stop working asap.
That is, unless you enjoy working.
Can I have the 400 bitcoin please and you can keep doing what youâ€™re doing
