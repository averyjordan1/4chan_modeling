Triple tops are chart patterns with decent performance in a bull market.
The failure rate is higher than I like to see, but the average decline is reasonable.
Thus, if you own a stock and the triple top confirms ( price closes below the lowest valley in the pattern), then consider selling immediately.
so we can't confirm a triple top until we close below the dips?..
alright>t.brainlet
Triple TopThis bearish reversal pattern is formed when a security that is trending upward tests a similar level of resistance three times without breaking through.
Each time the security tests the resistance level, it falls to a similar area of support.
After the third fall to the support level, the pattern is complete when the security falls through the support; the price is then expected to move in a downward trend.
FUCK :(
triple top is a big sell signal, usuallybut this is crypto and it might aswell just go 2x out of nothing

never assume anything in crypto.
It's funny cause BTC is only one step close to die while cash can't die anymore therefore all bets are against core.. we just watch them make the deadly step
