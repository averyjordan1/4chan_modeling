Lost around .5 btc in binance; (not from shit trades) for some reason I set up my stuff through my school email.
Long story short I Sold my 2006 bmw 330i for my btc and "shitcoins" made some gains and then Someone hacked my online math, Like I go to a local highschool but I got so far ahead I do homebound now at my pace.
Anyways I have a admin and someone sent my admin a butthole spread I mean tore apart.
Saying your my love from past life, I just want one passionate fuck.
Bro the cops and my principal came to my house I freaked out and said I got doxed or hacked to check the ip but I haven't heard from them in days and they haven't unlocked my stuff and binance wont let me log on.What really makes me mad is I got pushed in a pool, I know i'm fucked any way it goes bc I broke my phone and it had my google auth 2fa.
I'm so stupid I didn't write it down I only screen shot it on my phone.
Guys I know that not a lot of money, but I'm only 18 grew up poor af hustle every day, I work manual labor 50 hours a week.
I'm so mad.
I'll be hanging from the tree in the park if you need me.
**** I didn't write down my google auth code **** my school admin disabled my 2 school work account and my email.
******Can I get in bianace without my 2fa how do I contact them and fix that if they reverse the admin disable
