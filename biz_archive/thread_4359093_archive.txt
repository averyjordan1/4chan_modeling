You did zero research.
That's why you dumped your imaginary 300k REQ.

Do you understand what Moneytis is even doing?
I can give you outdated job posting of random companies like one of the big 4's.

Lol.
Why would I care.
Lol.
2016.
So the job was posted in 2015.
Haha.
I swear even the pajeet posting has decreased in quality on biz
You sold your tokens and afterwards you try this 2/10 FUD.
Mhm, why would you care.Moneytis is a self sustaining company.
It doesn't need anyone anymore.
Income and revenue keeps flowing and the team is 100% focusing on Request Network.But you little pajeet sold all your tokens.
So don't regret your decision and never look back, but stop FUDing around with wrong accusations.Peace out and gl in life pajeet.
You will never have financial freedom.
