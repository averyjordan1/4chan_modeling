29 hours later and changelly & coinomi have not transferd my btc!!!!!
Who else is on a long wait to get out of btc?
I think about 130,000 other people fella.Pay your toll goy
K pending transactions now your low fee transaction will take probably foreverhttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions
And bch just keeps climbing
its just gonna get worseit might take 1-2 weeks, or even possibly, never go through
look at the mempool.
you'll be lucky you get your tx through in a week
bitcoin is dying.
get out asap.
Sorry you should have got in the life raft when you still could.
Use replace-by-fee if you can and put an absurdly high fee in (like $100-$200 or something stupid), thats the only way you're going to get it confirmed.
You'll make the loss back (and more) by buying BCH ASAP.
I did put night priority but I'm sure that does not matterHow doni do that
BTC always wins, people never learn.
