Are market (taking) orders on HitBTC really market orders?
Like if you market buy B2X for 1 BTC it'll execute all the available sells up to that 1 BTC being used upOn Binance it looks like the market order option is really just a limit order at the last market price, not the same thing
actual trades, it's still going on, price is even rising slightly
I don't even
Yeah I get that some people are betting on an unlikely turnaround I'm just asking how HitBTC works in general
The price is going up, so it's not limit orders
Oh shit imagine all the guys who set buy orders on 2x futures before news and went to sleep.
REEP
woke up>killself
It's been bouncing from $180 to $500 for hours now, fucking bizarre.Some cunts are just too stupid to make money.If I had any segwit1x on that exchange I'd be dumping my 2x coins ASAP
Look at the prices of the buy orders, this are people actively buying 2x
I wonder how many of those buying don't know about the s2x cancellation.
I wonder how many are /biz/
Because they think a bigger retard will buy higher.It was the for shit like Etherum Dark and Litecoin Gold
