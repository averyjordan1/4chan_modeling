Option 1:>Hodl onto BCH.>Buy BTC as soon as it reaches $4900.>Take 5% of losses if it doesn't go up, transfer everything into ETH.>Keep BCH for the next 24h to see if miner's sentiment has changed.>If BCH keeps coming up on top, move ETH to BCH and praise the new king.Option 2:>Buy BTC if it reaches 6800.
Depending on how market behaves, it's possible we'll have a sudden movement upwards, which would mean BCH was a PND scheme.>If this happens, that means BCH is toast, go all in in BTC because it's going for a psychological moon mission up to 10k.If there will be loses, you're recuperating them in the long run.This is the safest thing you can do.
Be smart about it.
What happens if I just hold my altcoins?
You're losing a chance to profit in this war, but will probably be safer.
