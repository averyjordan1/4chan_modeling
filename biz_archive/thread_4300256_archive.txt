Why is it so hard?
give it a month, you'll be able to buy one for less than a used car.
coz whales and exchanges want it ALL.
they are working together to take money from you.
whales and exchanges literally talk behind the scenes to discuss how they are going to fuck you and the other users over.
this is not a market... and you shouldn't have put your money in crypto.
you should have bought low and then held for months.
if you trade, the house always wins.
I'm still up after about 6 months of trading but I've been pretty unlucky.
Fuck whales and miners.
They've ruined so many chances for me.
They're the 1%.

Basically this.
The only sane way for 99% of people to have any gains in a market is just to try and find the low point and just wait weeks or months.Trading is a spook myth kept alive by whales and larpers.
