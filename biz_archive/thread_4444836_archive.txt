Posted this yesterday about whales keeping the price low below 4k sats, now they're doing it at 5k sats.
Look for a consolodation on POWR and accumilate some more if you haven't gotten and POWR or want more.
But to be honest you have plenty of time to buy under 4k, 3k or even 2k sats.
Why the fuck would anyone keep an eye on this if you just said it will go to 2K sats?
