What can I mine with 2 295x2?Is it profitable?
If you're using it as a space heater as well, maybe.
If you pick the correct coins anyway.
Which coins are mineworthy
These cards aren’t very power efficient, so it’s mostly a question of how cheap your electricity is.
The hash rate itself is nice (check nicehash calc or sth to find best coin to mine).
Classic WoW gold.
Yeah probably not worthy.
Will keep trying to trade and lose everything in the meantime kek.
Underclock memory like mad, slightly underclock core, and crash down voltage as low as it goes.Zcoin was a decent mine the last time I checked.
just use nicehash, it automatically mines the most profitable coin and pays you in btc
Wow... White women are so beautiful

White women are so beautiful... until you use MakeApp on them, as I found out today.
That’s why they should always have make up on
Nice plums.
