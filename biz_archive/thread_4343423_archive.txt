From what I hear you can become a tax resident in Singapore and pay 0 tax on your bitcoin.
Can anyone confirm this?Also this guy from NZ said no CGT after 2 years of holding.
Can anyone tell me if true?
Us owns you faggot.
Renounce citizenship.
Only way.
I do not have US passport
singaporean here, its true, but good luck getting residency if you arent already rich
Thanks but I don't need a visa to visit Singapore.
I can stay 30 days each time I fly in.
Cash out, I can even buy PR for 1.5m although I don't think I'll be doing that.
