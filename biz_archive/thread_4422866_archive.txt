Alright friends, I might have accidentally went full autism and alluded to the fact that I could make a friend some pretty good starter gains in the coming ~1yr or so, I have $500 to play around with for the moment, where am I putting it?
look into blockmason, they have a platform out already and just had their ICObest coin with potential on binance right now and there is word of announcements coming out next week
ICO price?
ICO price was 30c and it came out on binance the day right before the beginning of the btc bull runfew reasons to invest:- actual platform and actual product- 10m market cap- announcements next week- just starting to get buzz on 4chan and reddit- co-founder of ethereum just came on as advisor- more applications planned for release on their platform by year endmight be a gamble but at 10m market cap it really doesn't get much better for moon potential
