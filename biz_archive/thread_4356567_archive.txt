Is it a good idea to mention crypto at all in an interview?what about for a non tech related university interviewI'm thinking no.
Nothing good can come from saying you're into it at all
Nope, most normies connect crypto with criminal activity thanks to media brainwashing
and now they'll think we're fucking pedos toothanks money skeleton.
hahaha ikr
Depends on if you make money or not.
For instance I talked to my boss about how I did some BTC trading earlier this year.
When the price skyrocketed to $6k he texted me asking about it (I switched to a new job).
You can mention it, but you have to not be LARP'ing and you also have to understand that they won't understand any of it, so don't go into detail.
anyone got a link for that.
I can't find anything searching and if I type the wrong thing into a search the FBI will come knocking.

So is this why crypto is so popular with 4chan?
Only if you can be concise and present the argument of how blockchain technology is disruptive to current monetary systems.In other words don't scream about buying link and implying their are faggots that do not like money.
People who go "hahaha ikr" are almost always pedophiles.
Yes none of us have jobs and we're all into kiddie porn and drug dealing anyway, hence solving the dilemma.
