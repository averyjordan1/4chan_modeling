Alright, /biz/.
Since you're smart, tell me what coin is going to be America's Ethereum?
ChainLink
It already exists and it's called stellar.
Thread can end now, no more replies please.
Is Nazarov American?
Who cares?
America is full of immigrants.
We can claim him as our own
Stellar is America's Ripple, and neither of those are useful anyway.
It's not.
There are smart contract based dAPPs being built on it.
It's more rigid than ethereum, but it's more than capable enough for stellar based versions of the vast majority of smart contract types that are being built on ethereum atm.It's also very american because it's a corporatist blockchain to the core.
