Hey billybinguses, which one and why?I'm in GAS because of the bullshit PBC call that it'll hit $300 in the event of NEO becoming state run.
Totally bullshit call but thats what tricked me in to it.
If you have NEO, you get GASWhy is this a question
I suppose I should have reframed the post within the context of a short term profit.
will you forgive me
Neo short term.
Gas long term.
Gas in the event of adoption will be more valuable than neo.
Why not both?
