What's a safe amount of fiat currency or coins to leave on an exchange?
I like to trade from coin-fiat and coin-coin on a daily basis so I need to leave it on there because they charge fees to withdraw it right?
nothing
So you take 1.5-5% hit on every transaction and wait days to get your fiat?
no anon because when i buy i buy to hold.
if you planning to trade coin-coin daily then unfortunately you have to take the risk to keep them on the exanchge.. still never keep what you can't afford to lose
