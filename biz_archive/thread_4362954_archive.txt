I signed up for QuadrigaCX 6 damn days ago and I'm still not verified.
How long does it take to look at a driver's license?
Welcome to the super efficient bitcoin world where people love garbage.
Oh fuck dude, I just signed up yesterday thinking '1-3' days was not a lie.Are they really that shitty?The only alternative here in Canuckistan seems to be the ripoff Bitcoin ATMs...
Only took 3 days for me.
We just went through a weekend though so don't count that.
Should be soon anon.
Also QuadrigaCX is one of the best places to buy bitcoin for Canuck users.
