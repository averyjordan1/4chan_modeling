If I understand POWR correctly, the basic point is selling your solar-generated power to your neighboursDoesn't this require a new infrastructure for this all to work?
Do all those people need to buy digital meters that auto-report their usage?Also, will the power companys really allow people to make a profit using their network?I live in Belgium and over here they gave large susbsidys for people buying solar panels, once they had them they suddenly taxed everybody (wether you had or didn't had solar panels) extra on their power consumption to pay back those subsidys and to top it off they even came up with a new tax called "prosumer-tax" for people saving money injecting back into the grid.And I believe new installions aren't even allowed to do it anymore(injecting back) even though that was one of the main reason to buy solar panels.I love the idea but it's a threat to companys with a lot of power and influence.
