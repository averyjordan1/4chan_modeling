Where does biz gets its stock information from?
I use a few sources, but often there is quite a bit of variance in the numbers and ratios, so wondered where do the investors of biz go to get the best, most accurate and up to date info?Also, best stock information sources thread.
OP thinks the information here is reliable.
How cute
twitter/biz is enough for me, biz is mostly useful for checking pajeet levels in certain coins
