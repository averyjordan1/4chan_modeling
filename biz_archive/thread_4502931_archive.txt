Hello /biz/, I'm wondering what is your favourite way to trade crypto?I've been having success momentum trading and flipping, also some morning daytrading when volume kicks in.. but, there's not always a good daytrading volume.Lately I've been wondering what do the most successful do and what is the best way to make money in crypto.
Is it about buying tokens/coins in pre-sale when they are going into ICO and just holding for a month, if company has good technology/product/small market cap/supply, etc..?What's your experience?
How do you go on about trading today and making profit?Please no retards, looking for legitimate answers.
Just hold the coins you believe in.
Dont listen to FOMO and FUD.
Dont put too much money so you are not emotion driven.Holders are the biggest winners in cryptoworld history proved it.
You think we are late into cryptocurrencies but look in the outside world.
Fucking normies have no idea what is going on.
We are still early, just hold and you will make it eventually.Im myself into POWR.
Its getting some FOMO right now but i will hold anyway until they make something shady.Enjoy your ride
>don't listen to FOMOride the whales until you become one of them.
just don't buy at the ath, buy the dips and stay up to date on which coins everyone is talking about.
Too much risky though.
While holding you are almost sure to make it.
If you dont fall for scam ofc
But what is the best way of spoting FRESHLY YOUNG companies?As an example, how did people spot POWR out, the first day it came out or week?
