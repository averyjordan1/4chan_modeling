sold all my Bitquence that I got during the ICO.
Bought at 0.04 and Sold at $1.00.
25x gain.
Puttting it all into the next ICO i just found.
This one is going to be a big one also.
I only buy 20x gain ICOs.
Daamn anon, you're suuuch a badass.
Im holding my bitquence.
Anon please tell us
Suppoman get lost, no one cares
Man legit.
Bitquence was my best investment ever.
I'm a bit upset I could only put $1k in it though because I was poorcel when I first started.
Who do you think told suppoman to get into bitquence ICO?
Me.
Now I'm going to spin my massive gains into the next ICO.
Whale status soon.
I like bitquence.
That is why I originally invested in the ICO.
But there is no justification for 20x price increase when they don't even have a working product.
It's all hype and speculation.
I'll sell some of my next ico earnings and buy bitquence when it settles to a more reasonable price
Whats the ico ??
As soon as I'm able to get my order in i will tell suppoman.
Then he can share it on his site as his new #1 coin.
But I don't want the word getting out and the ICO selling out in a damn second like BAT did.
This one is bigger than BAT.
People just have not noticed it because all the other ico and bitcoin drama.
Buy Whysker
