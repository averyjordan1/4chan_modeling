How's that Operation Dragonslayer going?
Looks like a crash and burn do far.
Instead of being advisaries, why can't we co exist peacefully?
Chequing account, and savings account?
Cause BTC need BCC but BCC don't need BTC so BTC can btfo and can get slayed
I don't think BTC segwitX1 is going to stay a savings account for long.The lightning network and atomic swaps only works with BTC and LTC.The BTC core guys and LTC guys know this.
They have a plan.
It works.
and no one gets fucked by it.But they are shit socially.Charlie dispite years of trying is a shit salesmen and the BTC Core guy is an Autist AND a Christian which immediately sends all the cryptolibertairinas and San Francisco faggots into freak out deaf mode.So thier message does not get out and we get FUD from (((takers))) flooded into our ears.I don't think the original BCH guys meant for any of this to happen.While the SegwitX2 guys wanted to destroy the market and take everyone's bags.The Dragan slayer strat is all the spited SegwitX2 guys.They failed once and this is plan BThey do not give a shit about transaction costs or transaction speeds.They just want what they do not have and don't control.
Why does btc need bch?
