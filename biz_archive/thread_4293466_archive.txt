Putting 1000 bucks to short BTC when it hits 6700 at 100x leverage gives you back A WHOOPING PROFIT OF 8 DOLLARS
you are an idiot and deserve to lose everything
This is a calculator, simulator.
But shows how pathetic leverage is.Who trades this shit, who risks so much money to win literally nothing?
>Making $50 with 12 bucks margin is a scam.
*8
?0.0011 is profit.
That's 8 fucking bucks.
You're putting 10 bucks not 1000 you twat, cause 10*100=1000
yes but you're only betting 0.0017, so like $12you're making 74.25% for a drop in price of 0.74%
Wait a fucking minute.You put 100K on the line to make the right call for the short - and you walk with 600 bucks???
?LMMMAAAOOOOOOO> le margin trader meme
Are you really too stupid to realize you are only leveraging $10 and bitmex is covering the rest?
you are literally too stupid for this, even for /biz/
The fuck you on about cunt?If BTC goes to $6500 (-$214 from current position) you almost double your money.Every $300 is about 1:1 ratio.No idea what shit you use, but these are shitty plus500 rates.
*100=100000gooby pls just go to bed
