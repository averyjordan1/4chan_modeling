Is GDAX a good exchange for a UKer to use?
Someone recommended a process of >UK bank->revolut - bank transfer to coinbase - transfer to gdax for no feesI already have some Bitcoin, but would this be the way to go?
please assist
Coinbase is one of the few that are fdic insured(in the USA) and they cash out quickly to your bank account I don’t know anything else.
I’m drunk as fuck.
Sorry
What's wrong with coinfloor you shithead
I don't know, everyone has a different recommendation.
Please tell me why I should use Coinfloor instead of GDAX

Just to it as told- GBP to revolut then send to coinbase then buy there or send on to GDAX and buy there
dont let it happen again
Well I failed GDAX's verification shit, so I guess I need to try elsewhere.
just use krakenuk bank -> kraken, buy whatever you want
Pic relatedAlso, tried to see how to deposit something.
Click on the deposit button (which refreshes the page of this ancient site), only to bring me to a page which says 'Select an asset to deposit from the menu and follow the instructions on the displayed form.
Please see the FAQ for questions or contact support for any issues.'.
There is no menu, and below the message is a list of recent deposits, which is obviously empty.Bitfinex?
Kraken is good only for transfering money to in europe and then buying ETH or BTC.
Then withdraw the coins to another exchange, I suggest Binance, Bittrex, or Etherdelta.
Also Kraken gives that error message alot so just try to refresh the page
