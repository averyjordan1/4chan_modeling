Experienced traders, what is your best advice for reading charts beyond candles?
What statistics/tools have you had the most success using?I'm new to crypto trading, and would like to see past small dips and gains.
You want me to teach you how to take money from me?
Expereienced trader here, reading charts and tools, statictics is really just fucking bullshit in crypto.
I can say that for sure because it really just is.
Its all phycology in crypto, if you master this and know how the majority think then you win.
Its just that simple.
I just bought my first 50 pounds worth of bitcoin.
Feeling comfy and am gonna sit on it for a while.
Is blockchain good?
