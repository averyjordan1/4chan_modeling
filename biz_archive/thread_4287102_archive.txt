Now what was all this about going to the moon?
Get in
literally the entire market is down except bitcoin forks
Check back in a couple months.
Project looks solid.
>every coin is crashing>let me pick one that I want to FUDretard
That it's happening, sooner than later according to their latest update.
lol exactly
Nearly every Ico and coin mooned in the last days weeks, req went back to Ico level and is again going into the shitter.>Let's still defend this shitcoin, pajeet memes like OMG 2.0 or PayPal 2.0 cannot even help.
LINK, MOD, EVX all -20%Name a decent ICO that mooned and didn't lose it's value in the past day.
Just wait, you can't expect your porftolio to be +400% every fucking day.
LINK went x5, then people realized that this project is completly overvalued and has no need in the next few yearsRipio.
Confusing.
Even Raiden did a X2, Agrello pumped X2 and i don't even start with shitcoins like nuls etc.>REQ did a good job in requing their Ico investors
Confusing = confido
Confido had a 400k marketcap, that's an outlier in the ICO space.Ripio and Raiden both came out after the fork uncertainty.REQ came out just before both forks were about to happen.
Of course people dumped the living hell out of it to get into btc.
how high will req go?
Now that I have it?
700 sounds about right
