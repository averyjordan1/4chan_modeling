Why was this still posted?
Because there is a fork going to occur soon?are you stupid?which part don't you understand?
i thought it was cancelled?
wtf
the supporters "cancelled" itbut a fork can happen if just one miner mines a different block.Something completely different is if the fork will have a ticker in exchanges, or if it will be dead on arrival (most likely this).But the fork is still likely to happen because miners are retarded
ok so its a non issue then
nopeJust be careful when getting rid of your S2X coins (if someone buys them from you) so you don't get replayed and your BTC also vanishes
i will, thanks
