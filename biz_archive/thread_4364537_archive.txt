Damn son.When it hits $50 you'll be a millionaire
Did anything get announced?
I'm scared to make the transition /biz/.
Currently I'm holding 53 KORE coins that have caused Mr nothing but grief since btc hit 7k AUD.
I've seen the delude arkies meme to many a time should I swap bags and hope for the best or wage my bets on just Ark or vtc??
This coin only goes 8 months back.
Also what about pic related?
Not really.
Though they did another full-time dev, a Python API wrapper designed to interact with the Ark blockchain, and pic related was leaked

It brings to mind shitty broken software, always some new repository you have to install before you can do what you're trying to do, and having features you like being removed in the next version.
Hoping this goes to $1,000 so I can be a millionaire.
My grandfather invented next generation robots for the auto industry.
My trust-fund pays me 11,000 a month.
This is spare change for me.
"What about that time when Ark was $1 before it shot up past $4?
"Really joggin my noggin bro
If it's spare change you wanna spare some my way brother?
