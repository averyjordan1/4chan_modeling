ETH is so predictable in that stays between 280-320.
How many of you are buying in at 280 converting to tether at 320 and then buying back in??
If you aren't doing this and making easy gain, do you like being poor?
I have heard about this 280-320 and it worked in the start but these last hours it has gotten very high.I will propably deposit some real money in it after I have found the best investing platform, right now I have heard Plus500 scam people, but the other non scam invest pages seem to be made for people with millions and not poor fags with 900$ to invest.
What webpage would you recommed to buy ETH?
I've made a few grand doing this the last month.
