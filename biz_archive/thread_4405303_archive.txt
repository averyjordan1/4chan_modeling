24 hours ago more or less I made this thread:I tried to help you, Bitcoin was at $7200, you would've earned a 10% (even more swing trading), saved your alts and maybe didn't FOMO buying Bitcoin at 7900 thinking that the next stop would've been $10kI even asked friendly tip in DOGE, never got a single coin.I guess you're better on your own.
