Is it too late to buy BCH?
yeah, oldfag biztard is about to cause damage prepare your anus
No.
It'll play around but it'll eventually exceed Bitcoin and take on its adoption and trajectory.
Yep, buying now is too risky.A correction is due, if you buy now you'll probably be left bag holding.
You should have bought the dip after the last pump.
Who?
Didn he said he lost like 100k with bch?
Can't be taken seriously kek.Not really, it's not even Friday, this is just the beginning.
If you could go back in time and buy BTC for under 2k wouldnt you?
it's not too late

But we're at the dip of this pump now.
