How is it possible to pump bch to bitcoin's levels when it took such a long time and so many people to get btc to be at this price levels?
If it's that easy to pump bch then btc was pumped artificially too right?
IDK man I can see this btc war drive people straight to LTC and Ethereum on Coinbase at least.
