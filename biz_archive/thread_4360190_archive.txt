Been making green gains all day this month on req mod sub powr ark neo nuls dcr ubq slr rcn and many other different coins.
I've attained "The master trader" title, only fuck up a bit on buying DRP at 0.003 ETH, but I only bought $70 worth so it doesn't matter.
Pretty damn happy with these gains, I get in and out of these coins regually and don't really hold them as they always come back down for me to buy which is nice
ok so is there anything you'd like us to discuss?
Yes.
