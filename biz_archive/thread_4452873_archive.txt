Hey /biz/ I had a weird think happen to me today.
I was on binance and I randomly had 500 TRON in my account.
I had never bought any and had never heard of it until now?
What is it?
it's fucking garage.
IA giveaway.
You can do nothing with it as it's under the min sell amount.
if you have traded 0.01 BTC you got it.
It's useless.
lol just hodl free coins you never know
