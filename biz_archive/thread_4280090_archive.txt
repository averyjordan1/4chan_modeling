My question is why do /biz/ cryptotraders sound like fucking plebs?
Unironically because of pajeets
quality thread op
Hordes of brainlets from /pol/ and /b/ migrated over during the May bull run thinking they were investing savants for hopping on the bandwagon.
every thread is generic.
buy x y z ensure x% gainsNo real discussion.
Just PnD coins.

Robinhooders with their fucking 0 trading fee platform.
Fucking plebs.
