Anon, you listened to me when I told you the BCH difficulty increase would actually make people flee BTC and would cause BCH to moon again, right?Don't tell me you actually forgot to buy BCH... oh no, your BTC are stuck unconfirmed??
Well, I doubt BTC will go below $2000 before you can get them out.
I mean, probably not...
I didn't listen and sold at loss and fucking deserve it.. but atleast i'm back on it again on the way to break even.
Hopefuly this is the flipening and not another soul crushing pnd.
Dead cat bounce
