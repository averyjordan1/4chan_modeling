What is this, and why is it mooning hard?
erc20 scam
it's probably going to 10x lmao
Another scam coin like Litecoin Gold and NEO gold
oh man...etherdelta is a goldmine for pnd scamcoins.
i keep gambling like $100 on new low market cap ones, sometimes you can get lucky and they do a x10, before completely crashing through the ground.
today i lost $200 on infinity pay.
their twitter and webpage suddenly went offline, kek.
idk anon, their volume is like $300k, and devs just tweeted about mobile wallet being in private beta testing..I think this is the lucky x10https://twitter.com/bitcoin_2x_org/status/933105471237615621
i hope you are in it for a quick pump and don't actually believe this is going anywhere...it's a fucking ethereum token, it doesn't need a special wallet, that's redflag number one.take a look at their hilarious whitepaper:http://bitcoin-2x.org/whitepaper.pdf>Why Bitcoin2X Is On Etherum PlatformFirst Of All, What Is Smart Contracts And How Do They Work?LOL
ofcourse, this will 10x then die out.
bought 10 eth worth so far.
Their website is fucking hilarious, I hope it didn't steal my links tho.
eth...you got balls, i'll give you that.
shit can go south within a minute, i hope you understand that.
why?
any Gold coin that went to Mercatox was x5 atleast, BTC2x has $300k volume on ED alone.
once this hits Mercatox its going to blow up and i'll have my 100 ETH.
You'll eventually get burned buying worthless assets.
no.
Confidence won't save you.
I did this 15+ times already and never lost a trade.
So let me get this straight.
You are 3-10x'ing your ETH by betting on these surefire ERC20 scamcoins?
Sounds absolutely retarded and crazy but for some reason I'm not surprised it works.
Nothing has made any god damn sense since like July.
