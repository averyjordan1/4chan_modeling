Yes.
fuck off the meme is over enjoy your bags
Bought a load thanks to the BCC pump, expecting it to go above $1 by year end.
In time with their early December release?
It's a good buy, my only concern is that all alts could go a hell of a lot lower if BCH successfully murders the market, which is looking more and more likely.
