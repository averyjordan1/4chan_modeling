https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imj9Zzt_xwQWhy can we agree to buy all the same Coin and HODL it for 180 Days?
After that everybody is allowed to dump it on Normies?
That's a good idea in theory but in reality one guy would ruin it by dumping and then everyone would panic sell
you need 180 non-jews
First suggestion: COSS , SAFEX.
IOTA,
We already did it.
It's called ChainLink.
good luck
it should be only 1 Coin with low Marketcap
a normie would probably infiltrate our group and alert the other normies that the 4chan hacker is doing bad mean things to innocent people.
Then he would get 100+ upvotes in reddit and be called a "hero".
What you don't understand is that we actually agreed to do this with ETH.That's what the big pump was for a while.
ETH was the /biz/ coin because we agreed to do this and actually implemented it.
If you weren't a part of that then you were probably one of the normies we dumped it on.
