Bloom actually has bad fundimentals you know that?
Team looks bad, their table of contents has red boxes around them and is an eyesore, only 50% to the sale and the rest to bloom, it has a 50 million maretkcap cap starting.
Other than that people will eat it up because of the website, logo and name anyways.Considering buying it once it dumps on the exchange for cheap and on the pump I'll sell it short term
https://hellobloom.io?mwr=6025-05a00a2aValid arguments, and I do agree that I think the initial market cap won't probably last in the beginning, but for a long term hold I still believe this project will grow significantly from that 50mil.
Nothing is crypto is for sure which is why I started by reminding to DYOR.https://hellobloom.io?mwr=6025-05a00a2a
Long term holdI would want to hold this long term really... Credit scoring isn't very an interesting concept and if you wanted to go long term hold RIPO is much better since it has a working product already, though I hold none
Wouldn't* I mean
as far as I can tell (and also from the devs' response on their slack), bloom is for credit scores while ripio is more a platform for peer to peer lending.
I'll have to look back but I think they can coexist if I remember correctly.
Ripio can use Bloom for their platform, for example.https://hellobloom.io?mwr=6025-05a00a2a
