ok so I bought 10 BCHShould I liquidate my one single bitcoin for more BCH?
Is the flippening really happening?
Flip a coin.
the flippening is confirmed, bch price is fluctuating 900~1000 while miners are accumulating bch/liquidating btc, so you could wait for it to go back down to ~920 if you want max profit, or just get in now and hold for big long term gains.
well, too early to tell honestly.
but bitcoin cash is going up and bitcoin is going down.
So you can just switch back if you find out it is not happening
