Does fame transcend wealth
Yes and no I imagine.- If you're wealthy but no-one knows you, that definitely has its perks since the only people who will know are the ones that matter (family, loved ones, old enemies, ...).- If you're famous but not very wealthy, you're pretty much forced into a lifestyle that you cannot afford; and even doing mundane things like getting gas can become very annoying.- If you're famous AND wealthy, chances are you're going to find yourself in circles where everyone is famous and wealthy, and you won't stand out unless you're the new hotness.And one can only imagine how soul-crushing it must be to go from new hotness to yesterday's hotness, and seeing the new hotness blast into your scene.
Also, the regular people that matter (family, loved ones, old enemies, ...) will probably hate your guts for no reason (except for grandma, treasure her at all times anon).
I don't want to be fucking famous man.having random idiots coming up to you to talk to you and admire some shit you did 3 years ago.fuck no.
pretty happy with the anon lifestyle
But most girls wanna fuck you though.
