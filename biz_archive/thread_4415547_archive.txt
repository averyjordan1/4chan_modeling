Even normies get rejected sometimes anon
Even if you get a job with your autism you will come to resent it after working there for a few months, you will start to feel asphyxiated and want to quit.In due time it will become unbearable and you will want to move on again.

Normies always have to compete with one another and deal with rejection all the time.
What separates the autists from the normies is that the normies can handle rejection and keep trying.
