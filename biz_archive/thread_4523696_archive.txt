Kraken.
I put money on coinbase and the deposit got flagged.
Contacted them and theu never replied back for months.
Eventually they sent the money back to my bank account but they still didnt reply.Kraken replied the next day.Fuck coinbase i hope they get in trouble and go bankrupt.
Or this, but if youre from EU they dont have EUR market
Kraken is really shit, almost all the orders you try to put fail.
I'm there and Bittrex, I'm thinking about moving to binance
coinbase is safer, kraken has lots of glitches but more currencies
bitpanda?
Kraken is fidgety, but works.
Coinbase is shit and didn't even accept my card.

If you want to spend your life clicking over, and over, and over, on the same button to try and get it to work, then use kraken.They are useless unless you're putting a trade in once every 6 months.
Avoid
Honest opinion of kraken?I have the max tier account for when I decide to withdraw anything into fiat, but I've never used it for any trades.
I plan to deposit 100k worth, sell and then repeat until half my stack is sold.
