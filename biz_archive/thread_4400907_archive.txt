is now a good time to buy COSS?
Looks like it's been sitting at 900-1000 sats for a while now.
Yes, smart money has been accumulating lately.
This will not be easy to look pass once they open Fiat gateways and volume increases.
Remember something, this is still in Beta....
Buy some for safe-keeping.
Been noticing some wallets being filled up with COSS on etherscan io holders
SELLLLLLLLI need to accumulate.
