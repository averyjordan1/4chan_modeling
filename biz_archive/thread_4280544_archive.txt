>volume drying up>stagnant in price>hasn't passed 7MM market capis this a time to be nervous or confident?
Working on getting it listed on Binance right now for the coming days.
I expect 30 mill cap at least.
It will be the lowest cap token on binance.
As well as the one with the lowest hard cap ico.
Expect some press picking this up soon.
i guess it's also due to only being listed on retardelta and kuckcoin, also it hasn't even been 72h since the tokens became tradeable.
hope that binance won't take too long, actually i'm quite positive on confido, just wanted to hear the take on it by fellow /biz/raelis
This will do another x3 at least until December, got a small stack ready
