The line will go back up faggots, it's in an uptrend with occasional swings.
Stocks move in the pattern of up - down - up - down - up - down.Now can you guys quit being a bunch of fucking retards?
pretty sure most of biz doesnt even believe i "muh flippening".
they are just happy to ride the hype pnd but yeah DELETE THIS COREKEK BCH NEW BITCOIN HAHAHA SELL IDIOT
that's why most of biz are probably poor retards, they buy high and sell low by how much they shill for the hype.
along with the fact that they probably use linear charts to capture the direction of stock prices...
can you pls elaborate anon?
are logarithmic charts better?
why?
any resources to share?
buy high sell low
"markets have a consistent trend you guys"
Logarithm charts are better in determining the change/direction of the stock price.Linear charts are better at determining the price itself.
Something with a static growth of 20% a year will appear like it's growing faster and faster, but in reality isn't it always growing at 20%?
muh tulips meme
thanks
17th centurygreat example you fucking retard
According to your chart there, 4700 is what we can expect.
Sounds about right.All price action beyond the $5k resistance breakout a short while ago was highly erratic, inorganic and unsustainable.
The fundamentals of the upcoming Hard Fork backed up how artificial that breakout to $7800 was.
Ive been calling for a retracement to the $4500-$5500 range for the past week, with a s and r level and mental barrier of about $5k.
Thats a pretty steep trend line.
The steeper they are the easier they are to break.
five waves up massive correction incoming.
