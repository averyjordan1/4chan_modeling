Metal has been tanking since September, it's currently almost at its ATL.
I've noticed the volume has been going up recently, are the whales silently accumulating?- recently released their Alpha wallet- soon to release Beta- Necker cup starts on Nov 27th, Metal pay is one of the sponsors- Branson might be a silent investorIs this shit going to moon in the next month?
Might go back up to the $8-$9 in the short term.
Coins like MTL and TenX require a fully working product to validate their prices now (speculation on potential is no longer good enough).
I currently own some, however I admit that MTL is a very risky buy
My average is $13
I already pumped like hell though
I think there there is an opportunity to make a quick buck this week.
Sell walls are quiet low and the Necker cup PR might do it's thing.
