fucking dash
PayPal leveraged its exclusive relationship with eBay to become a payment powerhouse.
Even when other payment options became available, people stayed loyal to PayPal because it was so easy to use.We think Dash is taking a page out of the PayPal playbook and will become the dominant payment processor in the legal cannabis sector.
From there, we expect it will leverage its dominance in pot payments to launch itself as a major player in cryptocurrency payments.The time to take action is now, before Dash becomes a household name the way PayPal has.Remember: Because these trades have massive upside, you can keep your positions small and still make significant gains.
If you’re a smaller trader, we recommend putting $200–400 into each trade or $500–1,000 if you’re a bigger trader.Action to Take: Buy Dash (DASH)Buy-up-to Price: $600 Stop Loss: None Buy It On: Bittrex, BinanceStore It On: Jaxx, Ledger Wallet
