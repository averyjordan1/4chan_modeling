What do you think of WaBi biz?
I think it has tons of potential and a working product, just hope it doesn't end up like REQ...
Req ICO raised $32 million, these guys are asking for $11 million.
They have a working product unlike Req and they protected ICO buyers against whales.
Gonna' be HOOOOOGE
This.
Unlike most other crytos in which we have to wait for a product that we sometimes never see, this one is already out and working.
ALL IN !
