Nothing stopping you from finding someone to sell your coins to somewhere else.
A forum, a telegram, even here.
crypto is decentralized, it's ethereum that's centralized.
Enjoy getting scammedExplain
when was this screenshot, is this from the DOA
It's at the mercy of the development team.
Bitcoin isn't controlled by anyone.
No one can just tell exchanges to stop trading bitcoins.
yep
Hows this new fuckup tho, $300mil ETH stuck in a broken Parity contract.Are they gonna fix that shit in the next fork or not?
They didn't announce anything yetCuckerin avoided twitter for an entire day when it happened
The best part about this is that Gavin Woody wrote the fucked contract.Gavin fucking invented Solitidy and he can't write a fucking proper contract after several tries.
Pajeet coin.
that fucking haircutI want to punch that jewnose
Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone, except Blockstream a Bilderberg corporation.At least with Etheteum we dont pretend its everyone and noone, we know exactly its a tiny skeletor geek.
Agreed.
It's better that way even if it's not decentralised and skeletor premined the fuck out of his little coin.
Bitcoin is not owned by Blockstream.
You're thinking of Segwit.
Bitcoin is the only decentralized coin.
All the other coins have majority distribution to the founders.
Not even joking.
Satoshi doesn't give a shit about his coins, he was the one that started this entire movement, despite possessing most of the Bitcoins, you can count him out.
Who dat
Yellow power ranger number 28 or something
Satoshi is dead, those coins will never move.
Isn't this the second fuck up, his ass was saved by a white hat hacker last time
he 'only' lost $31 million last time (4 months ago) on the same fucking shitty code.
He's a serial fuckup.
I have no idea why people still use his products for anything.
