Behold the next WTC
yup
it's good but mc is just half of wtc so not much gains to be made I think mod is a safer bet

I hold both, just saying
You biztards have made me some money in the past, so ill post this here.

Ususally there is a lockup period for early investors like this, but VEN specifically stated there was not.I sold right after this post dropped, the price tanked 25% shortly after.
So it could already have been priced in.
However, if CMC ever decides to update this, the market cap is going to jump to around $140mm, which surely will cause a dump, as many people are investing with the $80-90mm market cap in mind.That risk is a bit too much for me, so I have stayed away.
It's really too bad, I liked that project.
