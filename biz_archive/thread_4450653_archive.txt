/biz/How can I profit from the coming collapse of Australia's housing bubble?
Short the banks?
m for that, in FUCKING GLADESVILLE of all places?shit sonany housing market crash will soon be picked up by the chinks.
so idk dude.
can you short super annuation companies that focus mainly on real estate?
Save up some of that cash money from crypto and buy a shit ton of houses (Or just one) when the market crashes.
Buy a stand alone house as well not one of those shit house apartments/units they struggle to hold value in the long term as they don't come with any land.That's what I'll be doing.
When was the last time australias housing market crashed?
Too much cheap money floating around.The market will never burst.
I for one welcome our new chink overlords
the housing market bubble is caused by the chinese to begin with
Never.
It's overdue.
The Aussie housing market is out of touch with reality.
Wonder how much their banks are exposed to this mega bubble
