you guys must admit that the current bitcoin is fucking retarded, it's very different than the 2013 BTCa reformation must be done to fix the speed and tx feesat least bitcoin cash's idea is correct even though the implementation is retarded and shabby
I'm honestly waiting for schnorr signatures first.
I don't think we should rush anything.8mb blocks are retarded and not having segwit is retarded too.We are never going to get schnorr signatures on BCash, so fuck that shitcoin.

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BCHUSD/ipVL5Wnh-BCHUSD-update/#1 rated analyst on trading view predicts 3235 profit prediction if BCH held 1200 support (which it did).
3235/1200= 2.69X soon.Everybody is shitting themselves about btc hitting 7k, when there is no way in hell BTC hits 7000*2.69=18,830 in any time soon.
Lack of math comprehension is why biz stays poor.
