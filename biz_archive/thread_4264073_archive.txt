When does /biz/ cash out profits?
is it a good time now to sell alts and wait for them to dip again?

literally brainlets.BTC is going to crash soon, it was artificially pumped by a scam fork and bitfinex tethers.stay in your alts or cash out your BTC to fiat or go into ETH.i just moved all my money out of BTC.
look at the chart and progression of the day, already from 7500 to 7050 on bitfinex.
the bullrun is over.
Holy shit how ADHD are you?
We just had a month long Altpocalypse and you are getting jumpy less than 24 hours after we're back on?
Just ease up cowboy.
cash outI suppose when cryptocurrencies become widely acceptable and can be directly exchanged for goods and services then it would technically be cashing out...but I am never converting to fiat.
Never cash out, just keep looking at the numbers growing and imagine what you could buy for them, and imagine what it would be like if those numbers were even bigger.
When it finally crashes and you lose a ton of money it doesn't really matter because you would never have taken a profit anyway, but you still kill yourself.
