I know I have the weakest hands.
How do I commit myself to holding these Chainlink bags for a year?
is there a smartcontract that can do that for me?
Put them in a nano ledger.I wear my 300k link around my neck on it.
I'm.
It even considering selling.
It's my massive moon mission ticket.
literally holding ur link lol
i have considered using these "email me in X days" websites for the private key so finally stop thinking about the price all the time.
but that seems too risky
Use a smart contract and a chainlink oracle to mail you the private key.
As a matter of fact you can lock up tokens for a specified amount of time using Blockcat: https://blockcat.io/Very easy to use
Holding link is dumb as fuck.
I dropped my bags at a loss a couple weeks ago and am back in profit.
Iâ€™ll get back into link around feb
Very easy to useCan you actually use it yet?
It says "get ready for the beta".
