Consider this risk/reward situation:Buy now and speculate the news.
If news is legit, big gains but high risk.Buy the dip after the news, if news is not legit, you lose nth.
If news is legit, just ride the moon.
Might be lesser gains but definitely lower risk.
to point out i am a longterm Holder i dont want to check my porto every hour.
I tend to invest in projects for atleast 6months-1year my succes comes from looking at the bigger picture, dont care about biz style buy the rumour sell the news type of shit
korea has taken the mantle from china when it comes to markets that matter.
probably thanks to a large number of chinese traders simply moving to korean exchanges too.
You are assuming that it will positive news
NEO at 55$ by tomorrow night
NEO is perfect to hold long term as it generates GAS.I don't know about Korea adopting NEO but even if the news on monday isn't big and the price tanks back to $30 again NEO has a bright future and will see bigger gains than Ethereum in 2018.https://hackernoon.com/neo-onchain-and-its-ultimate-plan-dna-4c33e9b6bfaa
