In your time in the space, would you say the constant trading and chasing the rockets yielded the most gains?
Or was simply buying a strong coin and holding it more efficient?
I went from 1 bitcoin at $2700 and I chased all the pumps, now I have .05 BTC lol bad trader feels
obviously the thing that doesnt require effort would be more efficient, so holding.
but you are thinking about it like its work.
I love keeping up with coins and watching charts.
so theres not really the concept of "efficiency".
research projects with good potential>find a good window to buy in>do so>repeatDont chase green dildos, dont FOMO.
If you're listening to others' recommendations you're playing catch up.
DYOR.
Buy a couple bitcoins as your 20 years moon fund.
Put em in cold storage and never touch them.Then put another grand or two on an exchange and have fun trading.Don't buy shitty altcoins you've never heard of, or god forbid, ICO scamcoins.
Invest in a technologically interesting alt only if it sounds legitimately interesting and it does something BTC can't.
Honestly man just invest in techAnything that uses the blokchain for something new and exciting is bound to take off
Looking back over several years the winning strategy was to buy everything and then hold and relax, and wait.
Pure luck and not panicking, anyone that says different is full of shit.
