Only 1,100 SALT will I make it bros?

That's pajeet mentality.If it moons, you reinvest it in something else, then you invest what you gain and you keep doing it till you are a fucking millionaire.
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS
Hahaha do you really think that is alot
has anyone here read SALT's terms of service?because if anyone is going to take out a loan from them, they're bound to read the terms of service and realize some really fucking shady shit.
I would not want to be holding SALT if I were you.
make some money and exit pronto.
