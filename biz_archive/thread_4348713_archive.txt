Which will succeed?
Chainlink or Aeternity?
They seem like competitors in the decentralized oracle space.
I'm conflicted.
If Swift adopts Chainlink; it will win.
No contest.
We could be in for quite the ride otherwise.
Aeternity shill detected, get out of here pajeet.
What do you mean.
If it's not then it will be fucking useless.
Everyone is betting on CL cuz of swift.
It has nothing otherwise
The one thing I don't understand is this: what's the purpose of the coin?
Like, how will Swift, for example, use it?Can't they just use the ChainLink decentralized oracles without using the coin?
Thats what I dont get.
or mobius?or any of the other dozen oracle icos that will all raise 30+mil in the next few month
Jesus fucking christ I am sick of this bullshit.
Read the fucking whitepaper before you invest in anything you retard
Not shilling, I want discussion.
