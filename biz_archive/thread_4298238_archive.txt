lisk going nuts.
It is fun riding on the whale's back
>insane>literally no volume going in despite these huge buy wallsi smell bear trap
That one whale tho.
I couldn't sell 95k plus.
This time I'll sell when whale goes under 18 or so
Sold it.
Time to see bagholders sitting
This will be the pricing in of the keynote talk to come later this month.
Rebranding WILL NOT be unveiled at this talk.If you buy in from this point on in hope of a november moonshot, youâ€™ll be bagholding by december.
800 lisk reporting in feels comfy
Am I gonna make it?
try to daytrade, get yourself to 300 before sdk release
How do you assholes know how to follow whales and shit.
ARK should literally be at $6 instead of this shitty JAVA-based Lisk but instead you guys are following the Whale pumps and I'm sitting here with my dick in my hand being poor.
Is the idea of Ark flipping Lisk as big a meme as Eth flipping Btc?
k since may, were going to make it brothers,Lisk will take us to the promised lands
Have fun getting cucked by whale delegates that only pay 40%
Fuck this coin, it's controlled by cartels.
Salvation lies in the Ark
