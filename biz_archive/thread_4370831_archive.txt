Wagecuck here with only 0.8 btcI'm sitting here contemplating what to invest into shortterm.
I have work soon and work whole week so can't sit and watch charts all day.I was thinking about waiting until Friday as it seems like Bitcoin is having a bit of a rally and maybe buy in some altcoins cheap this weekend or next week.
I have my eyes on LISK,STORJ and Monero.. anyone has any tips?I might put a low buy order for either of these while im at work...

Anon buying shitcoins while not being a day trader is just asking to have less money in the long run.
All in XMR
Move it to Poloniex and margin trade it with 2.5x leverage.
ASTRO don't miss out
real answer?
put as much away as you can every month.
be as cheap as you can.
eat rice and noodles.
don't go out.
play video games (pirate them) watch tv (again pirate) use your neighbors internet if u can.put it all into btc.
OP, you don't seem the kind of person who'd do well doing short term trades.Just put it into relatively safe BTC or a major alt coin, forget it for a year (other than keeping an eye out for major news perhaps), and come back to pretty ok gains.
If you get 100%+ gains a year, that's a whoooooole lot better than bullshit index or savings account gains.
Split some between POWR and SOLAR.
Palm Beach Confidential might endorse one of them in their next report.
when the fuck is this being listed???
invest in me, big shaq
rdn, it will go about 40-150% up in coming month.
A good thing that almost nobody shills it here, so no pnd pajeets onboard for now.
