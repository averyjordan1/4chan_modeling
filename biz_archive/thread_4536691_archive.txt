Why is /biz/ scaring me with happening/flippening stuff regarding to BTC/BCH?
I bought BCH at 1200 a few days ago, what's going to happen today?
nothing will happen today, go back to sleepin reality, BCH will just steadily gain value over time over BTC, so hodlOperation Dragonslayer is just bunch of 14y/olds circlejerking around, wanting imminent drama
Thank you, the negative news around BCH makes me paranoid from time to time (at about a 2 hour interval)
don't hold BCH on january 1st thoughcoinbase is releasing 500k BCH to their users, and even if some will hold it, it will be a blood bath to try to sell for anything at any price for more BTC
bought BCH at 1200
Could be better but it's going to +/- 3k this weekend
Lol he made 35% gains in a few days what a fucking loser amirite!
The delusion of corecucks is unreal
Forgot about that thanks for reminder anon.
a 37% gain is not bad.
consider also BCH was 1200 literally 48 hours ago
also bitmex will dump all their BCH too at some point soon, but it shouldn't be as much, me thinks
Just throw your money into the garbage already.
It's not fud, you need to learn to seperate the shillers from those who want us to make it.
BCH will spikeSell it for BTCthan it will quickly fall as Var drops all BCH support and switches to trading BCH for BTC.
