Just bought 20k RLC at 7800 sats.
Feels kinda comfy.
Any other people buying RLC?
Me me me.
Only 5k though
I like RLC and it seems like a good .5/..7 coin eventually but it's going to be a long bumpy ride.I think BQX and ARK are more solid investments now, even 200+ of each should net around 10x by EOY 2018
rlc all day my friendnew to this stuffi can only afford like 500but feelign hopeful
I find out yesterday they are in talks with IBM, bought 50K yesterday for a HODL.
Stop posting that shitty meme.
