Trading competition on binance starting tonight:https://support.binance.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002905852Conference with Binance and WTC in 3 days:https://twitter.com/aeron_aero/status/932541023657611264Very low market cap, high volume, great team.Wont get it any cheaper.
also still at ICO price
the use case is too obscure it's a solution looking for a problem.
pilot licenses are issued by a centralized authority and doesn't inherently improve the integrity of an experience logging system without a bunch of other work arounds also being taken into account.
not a coin to hold for long i agree.
do ride the wave tho.
