Nothing he says will be of significance.

Announcements of announcements are always a bad idea for the price of a coin.
Perfect for a P&D group to sell tho.
Incomming more bag holders or people who are going to lose a lot of money and never touch this 'shit coin' again.
Oh well, more for me when it hits 9c.
sell the rumour buy the newsI was forced to sell some link at 16c kill me
Do u know why Link has been at a shit price, while POWR has mooned hard?It's because one project actually has something going for it, while the other is a classic scam that only tricked people stupid enough to be shilled.
Which is which, anon?
Where is this posted?
It's because one project actually has something going for it, while the other is a classic scam that only tricked people stupid enough to be shilled.LINK isn't a scam.
They are just way behind where everyone expected them to be, and their communication is abysmal.
This leads to the price bleeding out, which will resume as soon as this pump is over.
Depends on the news and if they lift NDAs.
Then we can very well see LINK at 0.50$ suddenly.
The news will be that Rory has been allowed to compete in a hotdog eating competition
So, what did, fag, have to say?
