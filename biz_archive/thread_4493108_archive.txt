Daily reminder no matter how rich and powerful you become you'll never upgrade your class of woman without hiring a higher class of hooker.
Caring about women is subhuman.
Flaunting wealth is subhuman.
Evolve beyond societal norms or you will never make it no matter how much money you have.
being human is more than simply being humankys
Daily reminder I don't like women
You'll never understand if you keep jerking off to pixels in the shape of whores and dreaming about a life that will never be.
The woman part tells me you're the kind of guy who will spend $10,000 on a fuck doll.
Enjoy hell never fulfilling the purpose of the twin flame, faggot.
