you buy bch anon so you can get the little green paper thingys ok?
>you have link?
Buy BCH>you have neo?
Buy BCH>you have eth?
Buy BCH>you have btc?Buy BCH yesterday>you have anything else?Buy BCH>you have shitcoin?
Actually keep it i think its funny there is a coin they actually call shitcoin
oh and btw, btc is almost below 6kso if you want to get in you should do it now
thakn OP now i can tell my buddies on minelpex to get bitcoin cash
no problem my friend i just hope its easy enough for link bagholders
Now this is shilling if I've ever seen itWho the fuck buys a coin that already mooned
exactly lmao why would you buy btc
its still not at its peak anon.Its way faster to mine because of problems s2x should have repaired, but they canceled it.
BCH still has some issues, but these issues will be repaired with the fork on 13thIt has a very good chance to become the new bitcoin
Why not just but the Obsidian?
ok one last timeBCH WILL PROBABLY BECOME THE NEW BTC WHICH WILL MAKE IT WORTH 7000$+ IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
THERE IS NO COIN WORTH MORE THAN BTC AT THIS MOMENTIMAGINE YOU COULD HAVE BOUGHT BTC WHEN IT WAS AT 1500$ YOU WONT GET THIS CHANCE ANY TIME SOON AGAIN
I love link but listen, I love link so much that I sold it to buy bch and then buy more link with those gains.
why not stay in bch a few more years and then buy link completely?
