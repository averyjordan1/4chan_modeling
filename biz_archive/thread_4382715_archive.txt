What is /our/ strategy with BTC's ATH approaching soonâ„¢
dump
Dump with Jihan and Ver
I sold my BTC at 2500 before the fork.
The only redeeming thing I've done is buy bcash at 300, but I only spent a 10th of my money on it.Time to proceed with my ath strategy.
It's been fun bros but I can't take it anymore.Time to liquidate
Dump it for BCH and enjoy the upcoming pump.
buying some whenever normiebase adds it
Why not short BTC too?
Double the fun!
used to be the deluded linkies now it the deluded bitcoin trashies defending there dying coin all the way down
