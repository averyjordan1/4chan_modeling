This thread is for real /biz/nessmen.Does anyone know of any index funds based on Cryptos?Maybe like CoinMarketCap 30 or even 60?I know it's a volatile market and the difference in value between coins, even in the top 30, is huge.Say if we set up an index fund, would we base it off 1 unit of each currency (1 coin) or say 0.2 BTC of each coin?Also, if any Spergies are on this thread please do the maths for ROI over the last 3/6/12 months.
I heard there's like Crypro 30 index but I don't know where 2 buy.
Ohh interesting.I was thinking of just setting one up and charging a high interest rate.
