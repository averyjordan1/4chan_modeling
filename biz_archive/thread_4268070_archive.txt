I bought OMG at $13 and I missed the opportunity to get out.
I am now down -35% which is good compared to the last few weeks.
Should I just sell and try to make profit somewhere else or just hold at this point?
omisego is the best project in the shitcoin world.
if you can hold for a year or two you have a easy 10x.
Kenneth Hotz, you filthy jew.
Just hold it unless you are starving.
