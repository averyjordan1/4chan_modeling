holy shit
What was the ICO price
.0001428
 ETH = 7000 CFD.
400K cap.A lot of /biz/ got in on the ICO so it's going to be shilled to the ends of the earth for a long time.
So many of these shill threadsIt's dumping, stop pretending it's still pumping
FUUUUUIICK YOU ALL WHY IZ THIS SHITCOIN MOONING WHEN NONSHITCOIN ARE DROPPING UNDER ICO??
dumped my ico bags at 0.70, should have held through - welp, better than getting justed
same
It's dumping>Been holding at around $1.>Spiked up to $1.25 and had a sell off as expected.>Market cap still 20x ICO>Exchange announcement this week + Binance in decemberNot "A lot of /biz/" since there were only ~450 people that even got in the ICO.
It's the same 15 /biz/raelis shilling.
I want to start buying in good ICOs like thisAll I need to do is sign up at etherdelta and watch icobazaar?
sign up at etherdelta Y-yeah
i didnt get in but the marketcp is still so low i had to.
binance coming, dividends forever.
comfydo
Remember seeing this shilled to death on here and ignoring it for that reason.
Wish I'd bothered to DMOR and bought in.
