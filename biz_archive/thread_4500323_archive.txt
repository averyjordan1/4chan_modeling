Link: https://www.groestlcoin.org/roadmap/ Seems like GRS is going to do a lot in December 2017 and in 2018.
Is it the right time to buy and HODL for long run?

never buying a coin i cant pronounce
Thinking of getting a 1000 of these because they seem like a strong hold.
Just annoyed how the btc value will probably drop.
Don't believe in hodling shitcoins but this one seems nice and low price still.
