ITT we speculate what "the news" will be, the price in the lead up to the news, and the price after said news.I'll go first:- Announcement of NEX platform along with some kind of approval from government body, I'm not talking a total ICO thumbs up, but just -something- to reassure the masses that chinks aren't gonna ban crypto again.- Will pump to $60 before news- Dump to $50 after news before stabilzing between $50 and 60
government announcement >yes let's let a white coz member with 800 followers make the announcement Lol delusional
Massive dump back to sub 4k on Sunday night.
Screencap this.
Anon, you're not playing the game right.
This will crash harder than ever before because the rumors are much more wild.
