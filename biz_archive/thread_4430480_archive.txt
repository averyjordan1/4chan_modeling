DIP IS ALREADY OVER GUYS JUST FUCKING ACCEPT THAT THIS WILL GO OVER $50 TODAY AND BE DONE WITH IT

i don't think NEO will be the ASIAN Ethereumif volume is any indication the Asians are accumulating QTUMthis hype is unfounded and a lot of people buying over 0.005 are going to get burned
There's always money in the banana stand *clic-clic, neo @ .0075 tomorrow
How low is your IQ?
Literally no one is in qtum.
Qtum's founder is a known scam artist.
Why would anyone willingly buy it?
