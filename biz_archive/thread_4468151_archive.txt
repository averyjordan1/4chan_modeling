Only thing better is a liberal arts degree from a computer science school, but most can't complete that.
I mean it's been than a non-computer science degree at a liberal arts school
Yes
you will have to put up with bullshit liberal classes which will tank your GPA.
If you can tolerate that gohead
If you are going to get a CS degree, at least get it from a UofState school.
Nobody respects a BA degree in CS.
you'll end up like the dumb ass who ran Equifax's IT dept.

I am not an autist and can hold a conversation, which I heard is like gold in CS.

I'm an old fag who's actually hired people for tech positions.Depending on the school, I might consider you.
But it looks like a cop out if you have a B.A.
in a tech field.
Would much rather hire a kid from a cheap state school with a real science or engineering dept.
Would probably cost less for you, and as an employer, I'd know it was a tougher degree.
