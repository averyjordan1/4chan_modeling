Are you bcash supporters thinking about doing another pump?
I would you like to scalp your money and put it into the real bitcoin.
Shitcore chain literally unusable, no new money will ever enter Bitcoin.
When BCH hits $50k, we'll remember fondly the $7.9k ATH that was only reached because of 2x supporters.
170billion (170,000,000,000) dollars entered in the last 4 months ??
It's just like the last time BCH pumped.
Big gains followed by a slow and painful way down where the bagholders told people at every single green candle that this was when it was gonna come backAre people gonna fall for it a third time (I don't count Bittrex early trading)?
I'd love to nab some cheap BCH for Jihan's next 'flippening' fun time
no new money will ever enter Bitcoin.
>they traded Bitcoin for this counterfeit trash
this is what bitcoin trash shills actually believe
Show me Bitcoin is usable.
Go buy 1 bitcoin right now and sign a message from the wallet, and I'll transfer your choice of 1BTC or equivalent in BCH to the wallet also.
If you cared about usability for fast transactions why would you support BCH or BTC?
Both are shit for that in the long-term and there's much better cryptos that do it better
uhh pump any day now right guys?
Don't worry Roger is gonna swoop in and save everyone because he's a huge ancap chad who's looking to buy in low before fucking over all the BTC holders
I will do it, but first prove that you have one bitcoin.Sign message "1 bitcoin 14 november 2017"
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHI GOT BURNED SO FUCKING BAD I BOUGHT IT AT 0.4
Roger is literally a beta and a faggot
PUMP INCOMING T MINUS 8 MINUTES
ahah great summary.
is there any evidence he artificially pumped the volume?
