as bitcoin cant really go up anymore, 7095 already, what coins should i buy rn?
BTC will go over 9000 soon because of the "over 9000" psychological meme.
Neo is fucking bleeding.
I think it's a good chance to buy.
so you are suggesting to hold on and not buy any alts?
After all this crazy shit, I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin at $10k eoy.
It just broke all time high.Everything is looking bullish for btc.Let me tell you a secret, most smart people are in this game for the long run.I wish someone told me this sooner, but the smart thing is to measure your gains in BTC terms and not fiat.When BTC goes up you better not be in alts because you will lose value fast.
