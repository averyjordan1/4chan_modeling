Is this the most stable coin wrt USD?
Should people start using this instead of usdt?
Most likely.
I've been questioning this.
The only thing is that it's so cheap, so if it drops a penny that's literally 5% so if you have 10k stored in this, a penny drop is 500.
But long term this will grow - I'm a ripple bag holder.
That's what I do with it.
Hold my stack in xrp and take out money to gamble on shit coins while my stack consistently has a steady rise.
