Why are idiots selling?
Competition is for buying

wtf, i am 50% down......
this is a piece of shitcoin, OP we warned youflipped this for 2x, feeling comfy
Guess we're gonna have to hold until post BTC rally.
I read an AMA they did on Plebbit and it seems like they're working hard on this.
The website is getting redesigned, the mobile app is getting released soon and the first apps based on the Blockmason protocol are going to be launched soon as well.
Add that to the fact that they're hiring more full time developers and you realize BCPT has potential to reach at least 3x its current market cap in the medium term.
I'm HODLing this one for at least 3 more months
i bought Blockmason at ICO and it was heavy for a while.finally sold at a little over x2 and was able to double my stack./cozy/
I might just accumulate more.
It's too promising not to
This is going to take off any minute, look at the orderbook :D
