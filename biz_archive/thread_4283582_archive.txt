I've lost over 60k in the last month.I'm going to kill myself.
what'd you buy
Everything that goes down I buy.
everything that goes up I've already sold.
What specifically though?
What were your big investments?
I put my money into BCH at .081. had a stop loss at .0739 that got filled.Just one example.
I am new to Crypto, but stop losses only seem important in terms of Stocks since they move a lot slower.
With the volatility involved with Crypto, to me just seems to be "buy your coins and hold on for dear life until you make a decent profit".
Why'd you do it?
Follow the hype?
Until you're down 30% and need it to go 75% to recover.
Your strategy woreks with 100$, not real stacks.
