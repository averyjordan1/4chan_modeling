Is this gonna hit 0.24 anytime soon or should I cut losses now?
I want to buy some ETC but I'm stuck here bagholding this crap.
$12k eoy.
why didn't you split between bch btc?its at 7900+ usd combo hold.
I tho bch was going to hit 3k
im in same boat, if it hits 0.24 i will break even, might just be my optimistic niavity but i can see another pump on the horizon, maybe not to 0.4 but it seems to holding pretty well at 0.20
How long can you withstand the Chinese water torture of drip-drip losses before you cut and run?
Can anyone explain to me what ETC has to offer?Is there enough space in this world for both ETC and ETH?
BUY MY BAGS
No, really, don't do it.
Shit hurts.
Try to buy something that might give you gains not this.
on a slight unrelated note, anyone know of any korean crypto forums/boards?, i want to see what they think about the current shitstorm.
