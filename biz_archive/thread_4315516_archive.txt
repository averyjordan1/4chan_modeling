If this ain't a TRUE bull trap idk what is
lmao, yeah thats a three minute bull trap
I'm sure it caught enough people to matter that bought that dip
there's no way this isn't a bull trap.10k bitcoin cash buy walls were reported on most major exchanges, this is what it looks like.once volume was high enough, value vs btc was propped up while fiat value was bounced back to a good sell point making a bull trapI swear to god if this doesn't go down in the history books as the great bull trap of '17 then I'll eat my shoe
