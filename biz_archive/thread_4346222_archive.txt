Need help growing my stack.My portfolio's worth hovers between $350-400k, and I can't seem to get past this.
I've hit 500k before but with the bitcoin mooning/BCH turmoil I haven't been able to hold those gains for very long.I'm pretty diversified in alts, ETH, and BTC, so I never suffer terrible losses anymore, but I can't take advantage of crazy moon missions.I guess I could unload most of my stack onto a single coin and hope for moon, but is there a better way?
Anyone have any tips for me?
Thank you.
you either play it safe and wait for more money to come into crypto as a whole, thereby increasing the value of your diversified portfolio, or take a risk on an undervalued coin.
Invest in NULS before tomorrow or wait until tomorrow and win 100k worth of tokens?
If you're not a amerifag, put 100k in bitfinex and lend ituse 50k to daytrade safe coinsanother 50k for shitcoins that will moon for sure next year such as link, req, doge
Is this you op?
Nicely played.
how much btc for a gf like this?

You could probably fuck her for 50-60k.
She was on tag the sponsor a while back
Perhaps you're too diversified desu.
You have so much money that a 30% increase every four months should push you over the edge.
You just need to stop being a puss and put everything into the top three ponies.
That's the only way to go to lambo land.Then after you make your initial gain to 550,000 then you go back into diversifying your portfolio.
