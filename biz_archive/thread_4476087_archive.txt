In an attempt to address Bitcoin's increasing struggle at handling transactions, the mining rules have been relaxed into what is known as "Fuzzy Confirmation".
This allows miners to partially confirm blocks to increase the confidence in transactions while we wait for the blocks in question to be completely confirmed.
It's a modified version of the Progressive JPEG algorithm.For you the end user all this means is that recent transactions will be blurry.
Just give it time and they'll eventually clear up.
