Peter Thiel and his non-profit are trying to build a sovereign, floating city in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
They're going to fund it, in part, through an ICO.Will you buy into this ICO anon?http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-5077575/The-world-s-floating-city-set-2020-build.html
Peter Thiel is wiseWill investigate
This is a great plan.
Once shitskins have overrun every Western first world country, the few remaining white people will need a place live and regain their souvereignty.Structures like these would be able to accomplish that.
Relatively few people organizing their lives on a community level.
Sounds like a paradise for conserative homosexuals.
Definitely will secure my spot.

No he's not.
He's just gay.
Well, the idea is that there will be hundreds of these structures and people can decide for themselves what kind of society they want to build.Peter Thiel can live happily ever after on coalburner island and people like me who think that this is not very desirable can live on a different island.That's the beauty of such a model.
No longer will people with completly opposing views be forced to share the same country, competing over who controls government.
No he's not, he just hates women so much he sucks dicks.
