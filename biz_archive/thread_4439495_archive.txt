My friend told me to ask here about some shady back room place where I can buy this for less than ICO price?
It's called Fenx or Feenix, thanks

yes, shit is below ICO and gonna be huge.
4439495I know.
Massive ICO discount and it's a legit good idea.
It's basically like utorrent but on the blockchain, genius really.
Thanks again, nibba.
Got 30k to sell, what price can I get for it?
Wait a few weeks and i bet $1/each
Do I need an external wallet to use EtherDelta?
yes, MEW or Metamask work well
So I can't just transfer things over from Bittrex or gemini?
nope.
ED is a little hard to use for the first time.
it's a decentralized exchange, so the whole idea is it works with wallets YOU control the keys to instead of holding crypto in an exchange's wallets (where they hold the keys, and just keep an IOU on their centralized database saying you have X amount of Y coin in your wallet)
t. Bagholder cuckolds that will never make their money back on scam coin
Should I put up a buy order or just buy a sell order?
You probably wont get a limit order filled.
Buy the lowest sell orders
It just got filled kek
how many did you buy?
i'm holding 5000
Feeling comfortable.
This token seems like it actually has a use which seems to be rare these days for crypto.
poorfags, i have 20k.
Can you full my other buy order at 0.000048500?
I smell pajeets doing coordinated shilling of this shitcoin here.Stay away from this, biz.
They're gonna dump hard on you.
