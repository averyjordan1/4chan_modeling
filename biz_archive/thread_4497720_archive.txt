give it to me straight /biz/, should i keep holding this or what?tfw bought in during the crowdsale (not presale)
dump that bitch
sell u fuck.
put what u have left in BTC
the shittiest of the shitcoins trash it now
Link will likely keep dropping or remain stagnant for a while but has a relatively high potential to x100, sell it if you wanna day trade or buy some short term moon missions hold if you dont need the money
dump that for BlockMason and thank me when you recover from this shitcoin
I've just sold at 24% loss.Fuck this shitcoin.

I'm glad everybodys dumping.
There's no way the world was going to let all of the faggots on biz make it.

Just dump it.
This shit is just Confido's slow cousin.
No news in months.
Sad scamcoin.
Only deluded bagholders are defending it now.

don't wanna be trapped in a coin i was down like 50% in and miss all the moon missions
Here I was excited to be the new financial elite with my all my /biz/ bro's.
I suppose only some of them will have to do.
Thanks anon, brighten my day
4497720this being said, i'm planning on rebuying in eventually when i feel like the team has marketed a bit better and gotten the tech completely finished
the devs are fatties, and said they don't believe in marketing their technologythis means they are very dumb.
you need to market if you want your technology to get adopted.
Fucking kill yourself.
They market to companies not faggots like you.
Bullshit faggot, who doesn't believe in marketing your product.
Faggots here trying to make us nervous, I believe Link was the right buy, we need to give it time.
Once this get off the ground in the next 6 months we will see this shit will go off and faggots will wanna be buying it up when it hits like $1 and keeps going up from there for the next 3 years
Honestly get out of LINK.
It's over.Friends of confido.
Obvious scam buddies.
4497938so hold it is then.
I got a year :)
price won't shoot higher than +70% of current one in next 6-8 months and will keep going lower, I mean look at Vertcoin price history
Lol my sentiments exactly.
