Alright scrublets.Anons talk about buying physical gold instead of certificates.
That's retarded.You have to worry if the gold bar is authentic.Buying and selling you can expect a 10% spread.Why would anyone do this?
Defend yourselves, gold cucks.
I have some gold and silver, but not for financial reasons.
I have them because I collect coins and such.
They are not worth a lot, but they look nice and I view it as a hobby expense rather than something to sell.
