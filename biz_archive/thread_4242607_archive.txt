News:Current state of Bitcoin: Bitcoin is not a currency anymore: Core supporters are: Anon doesnt know PoW: Segwit works: Increasing blocksize works for spam purposes: Core brought us to where we are now: Yes: S2X is a jew scam: Mandatory Core Shilling:  Anon runs a btc1 node: Segwit VS. Blocksize Increase: We reached the limit (moore's law): 
How decentralized BCH is: 
Fork your mother if you want fork
BUMP
(((Segwit))) is a fraud.
BCH is the only chain that will matter, nodes need rewards.
8MB is cheap af to maintain.
Scaling was never an issue with bitcoin.GAS THE KIKES RACE WAR NOW
developers are the issue.
so does everyone magically double their money after fork or not?
no only one can survive because there is no replay protection so whatever ends up more profitable to mine will eat the other.Some people say this is therefore the perfect storm for bch whales to dump there btc for bch and cause the flippening.
It is interesting they will fix the bch eda just before the 2x fork
Unlikley.
One chain will win the other will die is the most likely scenario.
BUMP
Anyone who is holding a large amount of BTC getting scared yet?
Cause you fucking should be.
BTC is about to die and it is barely being talked about.
I'm not scared.
Whatever happens in the fork, whatfuckingever, it will just make bitcoin stronger.
deluded bitcoiners
I need help understanding something:Roger very claims 0-comf Bitcoin transactions can be relied upon because RBF has been removed.
however, if the block size fills up again at 8mb, and I send a transaction with 0 fee will it be stuck in mempool forever?
Can that be relied upon?
Whatever happened to Bitcoin Gold?
Did that ever happen?
Are they still without their own blockchain or what?
lmaoI dumped the "BTG" listed on Binance into oblivion and got some free money so I'm not complaining but what actually happened?
nah nothing happened.
No, there have been discussions already about incorporating a certain percentage of zero fee txs and it will most certainly be implemented before the blocks get to capacity like the other retards have allowed...
We will laugh our way to the bankT.
BCH whale convert
The project mined like 0.4% of BTG so they're well funded for the coming years.
More news this month.
Bitcoin of the people will moon one day.
I pity all the fools who dumped theirs for pennies

That chart is the same green line for the same fucking core bitcoin just like it will be after Segwit2X.
Muh bitcoin core is dead scammers are just trying to fomo BCH bags on you that got dumped on them by two other scammers, Tweeka and Tone Deaf Redditors / Youtubers who are convicted felons and banned from Securities.
What does the past have to do with anything going on right now?
This year was the first time the mempool started becoming full, causing slow and expensive transactions.
It is now the first time there is a serious threat to bitcoin FROM THE INSIDE.
Quints and btc will be 10k by christmas
cloose
Core memeshttps://twitter.com/morcosa/status/927517228358094849>We decide what BTC is, not the market.all you have to do is read the rest of the tweets to prove how bullshit you are OP.
I haven't kept up with bitcoin news for a few weeks.
What happened to that bitcoin gold?
fork thing on October 25th?
Why did you sign that thing with a wallet address containing zero bitcoin?I think that should serve as a way of picking the better general to post in.
what do you mean?
OP signed "/btcpol/ - Bitcoin Politics General | 493561"with the wallet 19Q4c29Qg8L9novNZcDyRFNYodDkDkRRfFIt has a balance of 0 BTC
ye ye, I signed the message to prove i was the last thread's op.
works just like a tripcode.
4245211I meant that it'd make for better proof if you had some bitcoin in that wallet.Show that you're not just some yahoo.
ehhh, why would I show my funds to you.
I specifically chosen an empty address for this
So we know you're not some LARPing nocoiner.
Neat.I suggest using that to sign the next OP.
(then sign that using the old address)
will fix in the next thread.
