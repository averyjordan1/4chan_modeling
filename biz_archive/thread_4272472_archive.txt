Goodbye Bitcoin
what happened?
Nothing.
It's amazingly alive as of late.
There's some price manipulation keeping it down but it's going to skyrocket very soon.
Not sure what will happen after that tho.
Now watch me flip

Goodbye Bitcoin
Green id has itThis shitcoin could not pass 7200 after 3 tries.
Going down.
Monero about to burst, dropped way to quick from weak hands.
ez quick profit just sayin.
hahahaahahahah deluded.
didnt you hear the news?
its gonna dump even more now that the fork is over.
Exchanges show exactly the opposite, so what's the news?
About 36 more hours until BTC will have its next difficulty adjustment and the miners will react to Blockstream's kikery.
Wherever you are better make sure you're at your PC, monitoring social media, because if the flippening will happen it will be then.
This is potentially your second chance on getting on the bitcoin rocket early on..
Consider yourself warned.
what are you talking about?
bitcoin has been hitting lower highs and lower lows since yesterday when it was announced that Segwit2X will no longer continue.
Check the charts.
ITT people missing the altcoin pump after the fork and trying to make people dump btc so they can earn money again
WE NEED MORE TETHERS ASAP!!
