>initial investment $50,000>now $95,000>still less than what I bought in BTC the first timeI feel good yeat awful.
What do I do?I know I'm green af in real money but it's fucking humiliating to know I'd have made much more just holding btc
then stop gambling and keep it all on BTCaltcoins are only a way to gamble and try to get more BTC, that's all they are.
You're not good at it, neither am I.
So just stay out of alts.Maybe keep like $50 in each and put sells for 10x
This.You found a flaw in your strat.Be gratefull.Now will you learn from your mistakes or keep losing.
Stay in Alts, BTC is going down, Alt trend up for a while.
BTC drama is going to hurt their market impact longterm

green af in real money
Funny but this could actually solve it
At least you tried, imagine being way up be just holding btc but thinking how much you could have made by buying some ETH or NEO.
Just hold the first 10-20 tokens, rebalance your portfolio monthly.
Yeah I know, boring as fuck, but it works.
What's the plan to cash in?If you cash in all at once do fear the exchange or wallet will freeze your account or sunddebly it disappears?
Or do you plan on taking out some sums over a long period of time?
