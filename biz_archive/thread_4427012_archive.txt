ok so theres tether manipulation on the same scale in the banking industry.how come the government is not looking into this?
or they just dont care
how come the government is not looking into this?The government doesn't usually makes flashy public announcements when they commence an investigation of a massive international corruption scandal.
Look at the volume of it compared to the total trade volume worldwide.It's fucking nothing.
They're shady, yes, it's probably being used as a shield in the BCHBTC war currently raging yes, but at large and in the broader volume of trade it's just irrelevant.
I looked into this and its nothing substantial guys.Feeling kind of sleepy though
