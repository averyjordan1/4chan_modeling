I've been day trading bitcoin based on a 5 minute frame chart, but the fee for each trade is higher than the profits.How do you day trade BTC?
Is it even worth it at this point?
then you must trade longer timeframes if the spread and slippage is too large.
btc as it trades 24h7 and is still less competitive than forex or commodities allows you probably trend follow profitable.
market cap is as a single dow stock now
then you must trade longer timeframes if the spread and slippage is too large.Thanks, I'll try time frames of 1h or more.
