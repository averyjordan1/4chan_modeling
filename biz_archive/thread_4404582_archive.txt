Hey man, me too.
Was looking at bitcoin when it was sub 100 bucks and thought.
"Hey maybe I should try!
But naah, I'm too young for this, maybe in a few years I'll learn to invest"

lol same now
I quit crypto in 2014 thinking it was over.I know I would have put at least a few grand in ETH if I knew it was coming out.
Learned my lesson on not watching the markets for opportunities.
They only come every so often.
Mee too bra!
Sorry I misunderstood, though you still were in high school.
Btw I also knew about it at 300 bucks.
Don't feel bad, internet was out as I was innastan and wanted to buy 10k worth in 2012.Gave up and forgot about it.
