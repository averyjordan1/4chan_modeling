Only 3/2 Blackjack payout.
I hate the casinos that try to Jew you with 6/5
Meh, I have more fun throwing all my BTC at Dice on yobit.
nah, finding more stupid shit coins to waste money on is more fun
how is this /biz/?
FOLD
Fuck you.If I want another card I get it.Now hit me.
hit on 1-16
can be fun but it's a waste of money and almost everyone's a loser in the long run unless you're playing in some real backwater shithole card room that doesn't reshuffle often so that you can actually get a good count going.
Most modern casinos use many decks in an autoshuffler and only penetrate maybe ~10% before they reshuffle, so you can't really count effectively and so have no edge whatsoever
this.AND i found a little tiny indian casino in california.had like 2 blackjack tables some slot a bunch of texas holdemi watched for a bit, noticed they dint have like 10 decks so i started to count.they kicked me out and i only made like 200 bucks.
