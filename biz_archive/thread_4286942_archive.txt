Woke up, seen the hype.

Take a piss, make some green tea with teaspoon of honey, have a smoke.

i honestly want everyone's benefit brahThis is not the time to be in alts
kk, so what are the odds that agrello moves to 10k satoshis at which point i move back into btc
I'm gonna be honest with you anon and it hurts me to do this.
Agrello has been having a rough time since its release.
It's a great project and concept but in terms of a short term flip?
no way.
dump to BCH and ride that shit and GET OUT after decent gains.
this isn't over yet.
