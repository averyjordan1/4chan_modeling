Any of you fags holding BAT?
Seems like a long shot but its hard to ignore Brendan Eich running the show and the market they are going after is enormous... lot of the pajeets over on Reddit also seem convinced it will end up on Coinbase at some point due to Eich's relationship with that team.
doubt it will end up on coinbase, but either way im holding some long term (~30% of my portfolio).
I believe in the platform.
Anyone who's ever owned Batcoins regretted it.
tfw bat bags were too heavy so I bought even more bat
great project (and an actual product!)
with a fantastic team.... that is doomed to fail because people don't care enough about ads and paying content creators.
a real pity
I liked the idea but brave is not even that big and, after the shitshow that was the ICO, I refuse to give the whales a cent.
