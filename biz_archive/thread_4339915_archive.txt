If BCH did this well and is a fork of BTC, shouldn't BTG, the latest fork do even better?
I mean a few weeks ago I could buy some BCH for less than $300.
Since I can't do that anymore, maybe I should buy some BTG under $300.
Would this be a retarded move to make?
BTG did itâ€™s thing yesterday too.
Shot up 150%
It's different.
Despite all the memeshitter BCH is the real bitcoin, it follows Satoshis whitepaper closer than BTC, it is supported by the original BTC developers, anyone who ideologically supported Bitcoin before the blockstream corporate takeover now supports BCH.
so what do when I can't trade my BTC for BCH because fucking slow confirmation times and huge transfer fees.
Tried yesterday with shapeshift, but order timed out and I lost like $30 in transfer fees alone.
BTG is ASIC resistant so it will never get any serious support behind it, its basically a meme, the real battle is between bch and btc, when the hash power abandons btc and its rendered unusable (150k unconfirmed tx), bch will get the btc ticker on all exchanges.
If you dont have your BTC on an exchange already its pretty much too late for you.
Except if you have it on Coinbase or whatever, I'd sell it for cash and buy ETH and move it to a market and by BCH for it
I've got it in Exodus, but shapeshift is down.
