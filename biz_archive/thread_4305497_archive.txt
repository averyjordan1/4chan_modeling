Seems to be a lot of back and fourth of where and what to keep, what to sell, ect.. Where do you see BTC and BCH in the next 6-12 months?
Back to $400, maybe even less

if the flippening completes, $10000
I see it at where it was 5 days ago
thinking of selling my BCH in the next week- take my profits and then re invest in Alts again.
$50
 months?
Trashbin of history.
BTC: $8-15KBCH: $200-2000
Are there STILL non-koreans who are holding bch?
HAHA
$8K*
Why not, making some mine here heh
I've been away for a few days... can someone tell me what the actual fuck is happening with BCH?
this
It would be such a bizarre twist if south Korean adoption reached the whole country and then the entire population gets nuked.
The underlying buying would stop, but millions of coins would be permanently lost.
Not sure what the price would be after that.
the flippening
BTC correction getting people bullish on BCHWill amount to nothing again
I don't see it at all
Tired old incorrect graphic spamIs that all you got?
Why not post the BCH anal vore meme while you're at it.
6 monthsGood joke.

Great content.
BTC will become something completely different as a shit ton of wall St people have been pouring money into it... BCH will be more accessible for quick and fast transactions.
Everyone who has educated themselves even a bit knows that it'll be in the trash bin.Most likely below 0.1.
If merchants are actually going to use BCH 6K.
If not 500
They already are
how do you even come up with shit like this??
?No one knows what it will do next.....
lol if btc crashed to 1000 i bet i still will have made 100x what you made on your little bch
I bet more merchants are already using BCH than BTC.
Not even joking
