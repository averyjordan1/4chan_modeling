The price increase of BTC seems to be accelerating all the time.
The dips last for a shorter time and overall the price just goes up daily.What has caused this?I remember when BTC was $200 for almost two years.
That's when I sold all my BTC and gave up, until spring of 2017.
What happened then?
Suddenly cryptos skyrocketed and have been rocketing ever since at an increasing rate.Nothing major has happened really.
Adoption by masses.
Crypto got more exposure, also normies FOMO.Crash soon.

BTC as a coin and technology has actually gotten worse, not better.
The only reason the price has increased is because bitfinex has printed up fraudelent tethers to parry every dip and to pump up the price.
There are less people using btc now than a year ago, there are less people using it for commerce, the coin has less usecases.But soon the demon will be slain.
100% manipulation by tether.
nothing else
