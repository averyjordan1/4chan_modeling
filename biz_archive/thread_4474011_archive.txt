bought POT at 8000 and sold at 2000 cause i was so dumb to listen to P&D groups.
After that i bought metal at 90000 and sold at 60000.
I could realy slap myself :(, lost almost my whole money in crypto

Never ever buy a coin before looking at the chart.
On an uptrend?
Don't buy.
Simple as that.
Buy good projects on dips, sell when you make some profit
