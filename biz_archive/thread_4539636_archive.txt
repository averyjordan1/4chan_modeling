Very tempted to sell my positions with XVG and XLM at a slight loss to pickup more BCH and Confido.
Tell me why I’m a wrong anons.
You're not wrong.
All in on confido my man!
I like how you think brother.,,Sometimes you just have to check and make sure you’re not doing something stupid in this game.
You WILL lose another 20%+ today if you keep holding Verge (XVG).
This is the incarnation of a shit coin.
But what about the anonymity anon?
