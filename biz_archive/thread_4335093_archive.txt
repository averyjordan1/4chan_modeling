Just like most of you, I'm fucking done with crypto.
Tired of not having any semblance of control over my gains and doing the equivalent of a scratch off every time it looks like a coin is going to launch.I started playing online poker just over a month ago with $100 playing $0.01/$0.02 blinds and have made just over $60 so far.
Playing penny stakes I don't think that's too shabby considering you can scale it to games where the blinds are substantially bigger ($1/$2, $3/$6, etc).
Is /biz/ doing anything similar outside of crypto?pic related: graph so far at the $2 buy-in 6 max games
Sweet just bought 100K
Pump and Dump
Playing Penny stakes poker, doesn’t realize the tables at 30/50 NL are insane hard unless you can just diligently play by odds and even then a 2% chance hand will win when you least expect it because you can’t read human nature through a computer and some asshole have the much money they chase every hand
