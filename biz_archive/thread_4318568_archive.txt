>Go to work>BCC/BCH is at 3200 AUD>Come home from work>Down to 1700 AUD and dropping.Albeit not the worst thing in the world to lose some money (I only had about a weeks pay in it at when it hit $1400) I'm feeling confident enough to hold, Maybe in a few months it'll break even, Idm if it drops to $1 to be honest, the experience I learnt from my hubris will remind me to not be greedy.
I'm just happy I got to be part of this.
