Hello,I believe what a few other anons on here believe; bitcoin will crash down to around $7k soon enough.
Now the question is: Where does one seek refuge if that happens?
Mfw we are now in a time where people are panicking about bitcoin crashing to $7000.
Not $70, not $700, but $7000.Just wow.
Here is a good place to start
>lose 10% value>crash fucking lmaoI saw my BTC go from $20 to $6 and I fucking sat there because I wasn't the pussy ass pink wojak spamming KEKlord that you are
substratum or raiden network, they go up and down ~20% without changing much
ETH, LTC, DASH, XMRAny of those are fine.
ETH and DASH if you want somewhere to wake up to some gains tomorrow, but you'd better hurry.
Throw it all in bitbean get urself a bitbean wallet let that shit stake for a few days when bitcoin is back move it back to the market sell along with your new sprouts for profit
Agreed.
In reality bitcoin is crashing to $500 maybe even lower.
I would say to $50 or zero but there's so many cultish supporters out there that will hold no matter what.
