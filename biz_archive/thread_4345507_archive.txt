What happened to Dcorp, /biz/, did you guys fuck me?
I put in a lot of my money in there is it all gone?
Also I invested in emphy because you told me to, /biz/, but volume is all gone and I can't even sell.
What happened, I thought low market cap = winner, but I seem to have lost.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dcorp/https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/emphy/
Be careful trusting anyone on this board.
They're constantly trying to pump and dump each other.
If something has already gone up significantly they're probably trying to dump on you.
Good luck man.
I hope you make it back.
ive made so much money off these two and i bought drp again yesterday, waiting for it to go up even higher
Either develop the ability to hold a coin for more than a day without panicking, stop blindly following threads on /biz/, or start stocking up on pink wojaks.
I shilled DRP and dumped once it went 300% lmao
>people trying to pretend crypto is anything BUT rampant bubble speculationAre there people that actually believe this?
