I'm investing in both currently but which one will dominate in the end?
Litecoin sucks dick and was created by a clown aka Charrie Ree.
Literally take all your LTC and put it into ETH.
If transactions speeds & ASIC resistants is what draws you to Litecoin, than Vertcoin is the obvious alternative if not the superior option.
If you're in LTC for gains good luck as there is TONS of it in China just stockpiled, its the reason why its been down between 50-60 for so long.
No thanks.

litecoin was just introduced to the koreans a few days ago.
It's a guaranteed pump
