How much money should I keep in my emergency fund at 25 years old?
I think I'd be off work for max 1 year.
No house, have a car.
enough for a gun and a single bullet
My dad is nutcase and he told me he spent 2000 in one year, on all living expenses while being homeless in the early 2010s.
Not sure if I believe him.
He was on the west coast at the time

I keep 2000 dollars minimum in my checking account at all times.I keep 3k in my savings account which I will occasionally dip into to buy something nice, then make it whole again.Everything else I make gets invested.
