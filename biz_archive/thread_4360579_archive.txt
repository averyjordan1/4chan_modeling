Seeing this start to get traction on Twitter from the guys who tipped me off about HST and NULS (and yes, I hold a bag of ARN - bought 10 mins ago).
>Market Cap under $5mil>Circulating Supply = 11,437,811>Total Supply = 100,000,000 (non-circ tokens frozen until mid 2018)>Under ICO price>Markets: Mostly EtherDelta though some volume on HitBTC toohttps://twitter.com/JewKorean/status/930435376526872581I got 2x on HST and a decent profit on NULS despite FOMOing in quite late.
Hopefully ARN will turn into a similar moon mission.
Apparently BCPT also has good gains to make quickly but seems to have rocketed too much already IMO.
Also seeing RDN getting talked about a lot.
Remember DYOR as always.
