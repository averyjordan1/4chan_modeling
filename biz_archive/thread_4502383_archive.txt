I've been bagholding this shitcoin since late May.
Very poor price performance, despite its market cap.>you fomo'd into pumpYeah, only been in the game for a month when I bought in.
Time has never been better to invest.
you will see decent gains in 2018. if you're into day trading or not willing to hold for 6-12 months XRP might not be the right investment for you.
What coin do you recommend to daytrade?
since i'm more buying and holding, i have absolutely no idea.
never been interested in the quick buck.
planning to sell some of my positions end of 2018 or mid 2019.
