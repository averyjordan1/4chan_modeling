whats going on with QTUM today?
whats the news?
Ghost of True Capitalist Radio endorsed it.
actually im guessing its due to the BCH price drop on bithumb and the koreans are partially moving into this, market cap up ~$150M+ today
im in the US but I have a few good friends in SK and they're saying that QTUM might be embraced as the korean version of Ethereum, like in terms of adoption and widespread use, with tokens built upon the QTUM blockchain... one of them is saying this has the potential to hit $200-400 within a yearwho knows though
