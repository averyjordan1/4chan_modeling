>No results for XLM or StellarWhat are my fellow anon's thoughts on XLM?It dipped throughout this entire shit show of 'Who's the worst Bitcoin?'
and didn't see any activity like XMR, NEO, WTC, and VTC or literally any other non-shitcoin did.
All of which have almost recovered to pre-S2X levels.PayPal announcement did fuck all.A LOT of people want to see Ripple kys.Are you holding any - if so, thoughts?
If not why is it a shitcoin?
there was no paypal partnership
