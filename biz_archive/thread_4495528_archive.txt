Okay /biz/boys, I've got $300 sitting on Bittrex which will be my saving grace since I lost 70% on Link.
Please help me make it.
I'm sorry for being deluded.
All in confido
so you cashed out after your investment went down 70%?
too late to cash out, $300 is nothing.
you had to stay and hope for the best.
if it pumps back up you better have a rope ready
power ledger
I would've said this.

Negative.
Still sitting on 6k link.
This was what I had sitting around on trex.
Should I just get more Link?
yeah mate go all in so you can mass suicide with your linkies friends after
AEON
go back to ur job and get a paycheck.
Then invest in ETH and be patient.
