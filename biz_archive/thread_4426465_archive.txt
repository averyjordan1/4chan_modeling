Here's a great opportunity with TIO TOUR GUIDES.
They just got their first listing on Etherdelta exchange, and they'll be listing on Hitbtc and Binance later on, They're yet to be on coinmarketcap.com (CMC).
Most who are not deep into cryptos just buy the coins after they see them on CMC.
But real tradersbuy the coin after the ICO from impatient bounty hunters before it's listed on CMC.
Their token supply is only 450,000, if you're good at math you'll see that it's a token that will definitely be trading at$3-$5 once on CMC and a lot more than then that when it gets to Hitbtc and Binance.And some impatient bounty hunters are dumping them for $0.06 at the moment.
So anyone with$20 or $50 to spare for now, can go grab them, hold it and sell right either after they list on CMCbecause theres usually a huge pump, or hold till they get on Hitbtc.
Great and almost guaranteed opportunity for anyone looking to turn $20 in to $1000 in a short time.
And for those interested in free stuff, they post free tshirts to those who follow them on twitter and fb.
And then they'll use your tracking number as an entry number for their lottery drawin late december, where participants stand to win Samsung galaxy s7s, 10 holidays for 2 to S.E Asia and 2,500TIO.Do your own research and see for yourself.
