I read about this.Been posting and discussing in the Telegram group.
Read the whitepaper.
Blah blahThink this carries many implications, ethically.
In the current scenario of vote manipulation through bribing, threatening, hacking etcetera.Regardless.
Do you think its worthwhile to put my monies into it?With the current state of FUD.I also lost quite a bit during the last BCH/BTC/S2X attack.Do I go into this one?Serious advice and opinion please.
you're not buying from me
Let me guess, this is another blackmoon
lol ofcourse notbut is it worthwhile to buy?I mean will it 'moon'.
tiny market cap, very easy to move the price up but liquidity is an issue, as with all small MC's.
However if it does take off it means it will sit somewhere between 1-2 dollars.
Id like to think soteam actually responds in chat, clears all your doubtcoin really has practical applicationsIm not sure if its a easy gain or a long term hold
Erm, so would it be okay to invest like ~0.2 btc in this considering liquidity.They are going to list on BITTREX in 10 days, I think.
No doubt you need to get some, big exchanges not too far off
Where did you hear bittrex
Bittrex very unlikely, I dont know where you heard it from but your source is wrong.
The team community manager said so on the Telegram group :P
:P
really doubt that
I wanted to buy last night but couldn't get my assets out of HitBTC.
> HitBTC deposit/withdrawals went down as soon as BTG listed on Bittrex.
Don't trust HitBTC bros.They cost me an easy 2x and I'm sure they made a killing on BTG
And btw it's "United Nations RELATED* news"Expect this to dump when the let down news comes out.

Wouldn't shock me if /biz/ and r/cryptocurrency/ thinks UN will commit to using HST and therefore be dissapointed
