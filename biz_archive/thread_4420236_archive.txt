SELL WHILE YOU CAN
ITS ABOUT TO DIP HARD AGAIN SO YOU CAN BUY AGAIN WHEN IT GETS LOW
here are your meme lines for the next couple of days lads
It'll go back down to 5k and skyrocket to 10k+ afterwards.
You can hold if you want.
i see 5525 in the cards
can u explain when it will it under 6k?
BTC DEFIES ALL LOGIC THIS THING COULD POP TO 10k IN A WEEEK.
In the next ~36 hours
You'll have time to notice the trend it will hit 7.3k in the next 6 hours.
I sold at 7.7k, you can still get out.
here you go
thank u for this xD
Almost to 4444444

I'm retarded.
What am I looking at?
autism lines, you can only see them if you were heavily vaccinated as a child
don't want to sell my btc just yet>scared to go to sleep>scared that FUCKING CHINK MINERS will prevent me from cashing out when I wake up
don't fall for their scare tactics.they were shitting their pants when Btrash was nearing 0,1 that's when the criminal Ver showed up thinking he's Gandalf with Rohirim at his back.
the second it started pumping on it's own he removed his stash.
that's ithe;s weaponizing his money to make sure Btrash doesnt crash, and that;s symptomatic of a shittty shittty coin that has no demand.............ERGO THIS IS A FUCKIN PUMP
Ver doesn't have billions of dollars to prop this up, the volume of BCH actually surpassed BTC and is more than 6x Eth's right now.So not only did BCH kill Ethereum (at least for one night, no doubt it will again), it also killed BTC in volumethis is one bitch you don't want to fuck with
OP is a fucking shill on two boards now
yep it always dips on weekends time for the BCH second wave.
100% at .121 so I'm fairly save
this is how all tradeable commodities work.
/pol/149869445Buy all the BTC you can so we can squeeze his short.
What do I move my BTC into for now while I wait for this to dip lower?
Double top
