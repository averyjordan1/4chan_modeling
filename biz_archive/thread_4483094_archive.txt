We have the fundamentals, all we needed was the TA.
Here you go my friends.
Last chance to buy.- Merk
can confirm I just paid $500 to a psychic and she said it's going to $1 today
What kind of retarded monkey-drawn TA is this?
what could go wrongJust bought 100k
Do you even know what a Bollinger Band is?- Merk
I'm still a firm believer in the fact that TA is near useless on crypto~animeweedlord420
No one is going to believe me but I am fistnigger.
I have returned to ally myself with POWR.
It will make me my third million in crypto.
bb's and a line.
Thanks Anon!
Well, the TA looks positive so there is no harm in that if you are a non believer.And the fundamentals are perfect in every way possible.POWR is the best investment anybody could possibly make.
I only use the most reliable forms of TA, you are welcome friend.- Merk
You literally just drew a random line through the chart and then drew a slope connecting 3 candles.
What was drawn is an illustration of systematic entry.
If you wish to be a buyer in some other manner, so be it.
And we just broke out, my call at 6900 now hitting at 7266, your fault for missing out.
believing in meme clouds
If you believe in TA thats an inverted cup&handle, sorry for your loss
Anon forgot that one imaginary red line that goes vertical x10.
Good call OP!
