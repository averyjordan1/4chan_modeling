What's a good crypto-to-crypto exchange that's tÎ¿r-friendly and doesn't require any personal info?

No we won't tell you how to.
As far as I can tell so far, HitBTC doesn't require any info and Cryptopia doesn't require any either.
There are limits though but unless you're a richfag those won't bother you too much
