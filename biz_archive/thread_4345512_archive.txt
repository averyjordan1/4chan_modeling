So what did /biz/ do with their BCH gains?I moved 80% into XMR, with 10% VTC and 10% LTC.
I feel Monero is primed for a massive jump by end of year especially with upcoming Ledger support.
XMR is great, but it's a very long-term investment.
You can hold some part of your portfolio in it but money can be made right now
I agree, but do think it will rise quite a bit soon and if it does I will definitely shrink my position on it.What do you think is going to move sooner?
The market(including me) is now just focused on BTC/BTC, so i can't tell you anything about anything else.
I'm just hodling my XMR, we'll see later
XMR is a steaming piece of shit.
Anybody that buys it is a fucking dirtball.
I swung most of my profit into more BCH
