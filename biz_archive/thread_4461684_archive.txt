Anyone use the app?
Why does it ask for so many permissions?
Yes, it's great for some comfy bedtime trading before closing those eyesies.
It's alright>permission to change system settings
Thats why i still didn't install it somehow i dont trust binance its kinda sketchy what they mean with cryptorevolution 2.0 and all that vote to list stuff
you already trust them enough to trade there so why care more over app?
It works well.
