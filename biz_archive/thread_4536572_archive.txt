(INXT)
wake up /biz/
4536981Lol...
This coin is a joke.
Run by inexperienced kids who are barely out of puberty and thought limited supply was so good they shot their own foot.Now they've got a token so long in supply it's volatility makes it unsustainable for use as a currency for a service.
Dead coin.
So low*.
Fucking autocorrect.
4537059lol, obviously you didn't even watch the team page.
Team is young but they have already gathered a good amount of xp.
Just wait for end of December and get disappointed that you didn't put money into this.
But I did, that's why I know this is a shitcoin.
Fran Villacuck and that other kid waving his dick thinking being on a Forbes list means something... lolShit coin, shit ICO, shit CEO, shit CTO, shit website, shit token supply
I'm still waiting real arguments against the project.
By calling everything shit is not argumenting, kid.
4537742I literally just told you, this project is GIMPED by its supply.
It is not sustainable to have a token with less than 1mil in supply to be used as a currency.
This introduces WAY too much volatility for the average consumer, making the coin completely unreliable.There's also huge competition... Filecoin, Storj, Sia, Feenix... why should someone use Internxt instead of any of those?
Then comes the fact that file storage was supposedly only one of the main factors of INXT, it was trying to compete with Substratum and Shift at first, and then out of nowhere changed to only be a file storage solution.Worst of all is the team.
There's is literally not a single person with credibility or an amazing portfolio.
This is the biggest drawback for me.
Team is completely green, full of literal kids with no credentials who are biting more than they can chew.+Nice idea-Big competition-EXTREMELY limited supply-Team greener than good ganjaWould be good for day trading if it had more volume I guess.
