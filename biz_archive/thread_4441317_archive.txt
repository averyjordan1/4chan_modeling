Okay, so Bitcoin is a store of value.
Digital gold as they sayExplain to me the way the alt coins work.
The coins represent an idea, or a functioning technology.
But why are they coins?
Why are they considered a currency?
How do they represent technologies?It seems to me the altcoin market, or crypto space, is just an alternative to Wall Street.
You are just buying shares in a company that you hope succeeds.
I just do not understand why all of these alts are pretending to be currency.Be easy on me and my brainlet self
please respond
bump i got 5k in and dont know the answer.

Okay OP, here's the deal.
Some guy has a bunch of ideas that he believes would make his altcoin better than bitcoin.
He makes a new cryptocurrency.
He then proceeds to explain to a bunch of people on the internet why his coin is better because it has features X, Y, Z.
Some people buy into his ideas and purchase his coins, thereby raising the value of his altcoin.
These ideas and features mean absolutely nothing though, because there are currently 1300 different cryptos on the market, and no amount of technical brilliance and expertise will make your altcoin more significant than a 1-week pump-and-dump.
buy high, sell low
You buy any coins that is low, and put a sell order 50% higher.
Many altcoins are pretty much trying to make a better Bitcoin, and hope people will pick it up and one day use it as a real currencyMost alts are actually better technologically than BTC, but it largely doesn't matter given BTC's first mover advantage and high visibility.
I do believe that one day however something will topple BTC
