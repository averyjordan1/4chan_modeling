For anyone who hasn't seen the threads, UFR is a token that incentivizes seeding torrents by giving a kickback in the form of fees to the seeder.
Market cap is like 900k right now and the supply will be reduced to 3 fucking percent today.
i'm still waiting for evidence the six million were burned.
What's the catch?
token burn happenedIt's still going down sonIt's dead and no one is buying your bags
I just bought in a few hours ago at ~.00018 so I'm not too worriedThe catch is that it's only on Etherdelta
>falling for the token burn meme
Token burn gets priced in as soon as they announce they're doing it..Not the day they actually do it..
priced in
I bought into the ICO for this and got out with 13x profit :∆)
This, it’s literally only going down and not even the token burn did anything.
