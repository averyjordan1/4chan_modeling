Why haven't you bought DOGE yet, anon?The original meme is calling to you.
Joke coin, worthless
worthlessits actually one of the best coins for transfersfast as hell too
joke coinx20 potential profit
I sold 300k to buy BCH yesterdayFFSwell, at least I made some money with BCH too
Doge is actually a good indicator.
A doge pump means the market is healthy af
FUCKING KILL DOGE RIGHT NOW SHORT HARD REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Nope.
I used doge quite a lot when it was around 140 sats for transferring money from one exchange to another, it was fast and cheap as hell.
Would love to see it up there again, because buying at 17 sats and selling at 16 sats at another exchange is not really attractive for transfers lol, compared to buying at 140 sats and maybe getting rid of it at 143 or something like that
What about the 5 blue candles where it doesnt moon?
how come?
FUCK YOU SELL DOGE NOW
No indicator is perfect but you could argue there was no reason to think of that level as the bottom relative to history, whereas we've just bounced off all-time lows
Just grabbed .24 BTC worth, so about 1mil.
Going to enjoy this ride.
The seasonal pump is here baby!
I've been looking for something to toss the last 400 i have in fiat into, >meme coin, doesn't completely die>numerous moon missions>literal pump coinalthough the 3 week pump timeframe feels a bit slow, but if it turns my $400 to over 2k, I'll take it.
I forgot password from my wallet back in 2014, 20 million doge, password was over 40 letters long and I tried bruteforcing and remembering it couple of times without success

bought at 16, feels good.thanks to the anon who made that doge thread a couple weeks ago
