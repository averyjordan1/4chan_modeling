Tell me about this coin.
I'm not sure but some rando anon recommended ZCG a week or so ago, so I put an ETH in it for fun at 0.0002 at that time on ED.
Now it's gone up 6x.
Hey, how do I withdraw a coin from etherdelta?also I placed a sell order that I want canceled but it is saying I need gas to cancel the order?
I am afraid I undersold my precious coins
I bought it at ath, will it pump again?
maybe, in like 2 years, You all fucked up by not buying Astro, its trading under a contract address, once it gets an actual listing on etherdelta it will blow up way more than ZCG and EPY maybe combined.
