>centralized exchange that will make you jump through hoops to verify and then lock you just like bittrex>retarded minimum deposits>shit ui >lazy shills
literal pyramid scheme, offers absolutely nothing new
I keep reading about people getting locked from bittrex.
Are verified people getting locked?
Or are they getting caught in the "you can deposit, but can't withdraw until we verify you but you failed verification so now we have your crypto" trick?

Yeah I'm a coss holder myself but I dont think this is going anywhere above 10 cents in the next 6 months, I'll probably dump and take the loss

Didn't you read the update?
Fiat gateways are not coming until after they rebuild the entire backend.
> Let us build a strong exchange first that we all can be proud of, then once we are 100% satisfied with the exchange, we start adding focus to the payment-gateway/POS and other features.
In short: We decided to become GOOD at something instead of mediocre at many things.Fiat gateways next year, if you're lucky.
