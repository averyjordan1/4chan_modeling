Two are on coinmarketcap and at least only has 1-2 exchanges , volume can be shit low on some but the other two have 10+.
I'll give you some hints:Coin 1: No Premine - Prefix is similar to a girls name.
Smart contracts ;)Coin 2: Zerocoin Protocol - Privacy Coin - Was just enlisted to CMC 3 days ago.
Hugely diverse user base , i wonder why?
Coin 3: Not on any exchanges yet, Quark algorithm and had an ANN thread this month.
Happy hunting anon's , last hint i'll give you about all three is that they plan to incorporate masternodes or already have.PS: Cheers to the anon who called Nuls, this is for brospeh.
I know the first one anons what will you niggers give me
#2 looks cool but it's only on some shitpoop exchange I don't want to dick with

I don't trust music coins bro.They don't really do shit imo.
This is an ARK fork.
Might as well just buy ARK.
Good anon ;) > You've received one ANON point!
ANON point's can be used buy your favourite  wojak's and pepe memes.
Directly outsourced  from teh epicentre of memes, quality is  reassured.
ANON uses a POM - (Proof of Meme)  algorithm to find you the desired memes at any  time.
It looks shit though
Ok, opinions on DCORP?https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dcorp/looks really good
Dude look at the userbase, there is nationalites from all around hopping on this.
Which is a very good sign, Zeroprotocol and POS along with some exciting attributes planned on their roadmap.
I got in at a nice entry point so i'm gonna hold my ground.
Going to cryptopia this month.
