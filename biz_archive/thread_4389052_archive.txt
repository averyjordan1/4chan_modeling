why is lisk mooning?
Gayest logo EVER
upcoming (big?)
news nov 22
Because it's a good project that was shilled on the biz when it was 2 dollars but no one listened.
This is why the rebrand will be key to its success
When's the best time to buy?
Price should slip soon (sell the news).
bucks?
I remember shilling this thing in early 2016 @ 8 cents.
ya'll noobs
lol ive been shilling this since it was a dollar.constantly was told its a shitcoin, scam, etc etcnow that its over $9, all over reddit wants to jump on LOL
it was 8 cents for like 2 days nigger.
But yeah this thing has been shilled on here forever.
Why did I pick Stratis over this 6 months ago... still did alright with Stratis though so can't complain :)
Is it also because Lisk reward decreases from 5 to 4?
yeah that happened as well.
reward reductions almost always increase the coin value significantly (which is why so many people are jizzing over VTC's big reduction in Dec)
