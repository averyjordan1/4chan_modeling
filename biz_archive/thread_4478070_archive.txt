Everything seems to be crashing down
bitfinex shills are all over.
we can smell your shit, you fucktards.
we can feel you cooking up some shady shit.
i know you're all cold sweating and shitting your pants right now.
gubermint is gonna want to know where the money went (unless, of course, bitfinex doesn't have an actual bank).
It's only 0 mil since all the Tethers have been flagged and won't actually be able to be used
exactly, people are just panicing and feeding of of eachothers fear instead of realising that this small loss means nothing to the market.everyone just looks at the big headlines like "hacked" and "loss" or "its over" etc and selling.
and this is exactly what big investors want you to do, is to think emotionally and not cold blooded and rational like a real investor should.
i've been waiting for an opportunity to by bitcoinwhen do i do it?_?

Its value is purely emotional.
