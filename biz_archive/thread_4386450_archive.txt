No the transition will be smooth and le honey badger xd will be fine just ask richard hearth
Yup bet against BTC.
Good luck with that.
Save enough money for those knee pads faggot and practice your gag reflex for when it's Tyron's turn.
But seriously, i doubt they would allow this Tether mess (true or not) to continue without at least an investigation.
Can you imagine Tether pumping or dumping the price when institutional money is aboard?
Shit is going to be investigated.
You fags wanted institutional money right?
This is how institutions play faggot.
They wont even hold BTC, its cash settled.
I dont understand how you fags are bullish for this.
What you want for BTC is an ETF where they have to buy the underlying BTC not this shit.
