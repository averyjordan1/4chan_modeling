Most alts seem to be shitcoins that are meant to get pumped and dumped so the creators can make a quick buck.If I want to be an ethical, non greedy fag and make a coin with the intention of accomplishing something like what the original idea of crypto was meant to, how do?
Or will all coins eventually fall into the trap of greed (if it ever becomes successful) despite the dev's intentions?
Monero: Community developed, anti hype, private, anti-government, anti-centralisation "Libertarian bucks".
It's about as close to "pure crypto" as it gets, I would say.
