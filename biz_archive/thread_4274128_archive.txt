Am I a wagecuck if I don't get 100% of my income from crypto.
Or can I start a business and become my own boss doing something I'm passionate about with the money I've made from here?
No clue.
Can you?
There is a good reason /biz/ is almost entirely crypto.
Its thte fastest way to making serious money for young people.
The rest of businesses are mostly mature, or high entry cost.
Millenials and below are fucked, crypto is the golden ticket out of wageslavery and shitty businesses regulated to all hell
