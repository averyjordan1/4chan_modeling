who /freebleeding/ here?can't wait to get dumped on with the mobile wallet release so I can buy more ARK
JavascriptWew.
Shitcoins will never learn.
Those digits.
Unironically dropping my bags.
there's going to be a sea of crying wojaks of noarks not buying Ark under $10 come summer 2018.
I know I'm all in on arkjust saying that the wallet thing is more likely to be a dump than a pumpwallets are probably the most boring news a project can announce and everyone sells the news
Nah dudePeople will see how sexy and sleek they are, and how easy it is to scan another user's QR code (who are then added to your address book) and instantly send them any amount of Ark.
And the business entity being completed on the roadmap will mean the first legitimate partnerships can be made.
Shill threadTime to pump ark and drop some baggage
Why are there so many?
The threads coincide with pumping ark.
People see green candles people buy.
The thing is it's a promising project if over ambitious.
Assuming they can deliver there is reward possibly very big reward.
Just understand there is a chance it sinks to two dollars and makes a hard exit.
And the current manipulative behaviour doesn't instill confidence.
But if you were to stake do it when you don't see Ark threads.
