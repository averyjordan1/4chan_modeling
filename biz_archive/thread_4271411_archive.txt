This shitcoin still is tainted by his founder....ripple-off....Just lost 70% of his value last 6 months....goes up a bit....next big thing.....really?

Only an idiot would not buy this now.
The market cap is only a fraction of that of Ripple.
Did you guys even read the AMA?
IBM is already using Stellar.
This is going to be really big, I would go as far to say this is probably the most undervalued crypto right now.
this and ETP
The PBC hype on /biz/ was wave 1, IBM news was wave 2 a few weeks back.The IBM guy interacting with Stellar did an AMA and hinted on another big 'marketmaker' being announced very soon.
PBC way back spoke about a lot of big announcements in Q4 and Q1 2018.
This is happening and I think everyone who's serious about investing in crypto in /biz/ should look into this.There's a lot of promising alts being traded, but Stellar is actually CONFIRMED already being used for real world transactions by IBM.
Pay attention to these words.
STELLAR.

NOW.Stop messing around, we're in this together as /biz/, we're too small of a community to pump a shitcoin or dump on eachother.
This is a chance to get in early guys.
What exchange can I buy this on?
