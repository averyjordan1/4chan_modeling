who else fucked up and didnt buy Bitcoin Cash a few days ago?Who else missed their second chance?
We told you so many times and you called us dumb fags
The cash part means it will never be accepted by normies
this pic always reminds me of that anon and his cucumbers
not a problem, because soon it will just be referred to as bitcoin
I sold my BCH just before the pump...
Bought 100 BTC worth when it was .08.
Bought 200 BTC when it was .18-.2
Yeah I could've bought it sub .1 and didn't fuck my lifeI'm still a btc maximalist but I could have double my btc.
I sold 50 BCH at $820 like a good goy.
i bought exactly 1 at ~$820.
its roughly doubled now and i'm debating whether to cash out half and sit on what remains with no worries.
Me... Oh wait no, i went all.in at 300/dollars
proof?
u rich now
i'm going to ride my 0.04 all the way to the top baby.
Sky's the limit and a matchbox lambo is the dream
