I can tell you that you have mad it anon.
You will soon have every last fuck you know expecting you to take care of them and the IRS to be on your ass.
Just keep your shit to yourself and pay the gov when u need to.I would be on the news 24/7 just waiting for the bubble to bust tho because we all know it will happen.
Probably sometime in February 2018 BTC will drop to 2.5k-3k and stay there for a few years.
If I was you I would go ball to the wall and make as much money as u can before christmas then cash out %15 in case that shit pops early next year.
You could easily have a million by christmas at this rate.
Many coins will double before then and you could easily ride 5 or 10 of them.
