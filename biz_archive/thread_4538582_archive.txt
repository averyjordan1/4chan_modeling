Currently holding>REQ>POWR>QSP>LINKcurrently most in on LINK - Should I dump one or go all in on one?Advise pls anons, I feel like I'm going crazy.
I'm in this for the long term future super moon mission to become millionaire - hence why it's shitcoins/altcoins only.
Do not have enough money to make it off of holding BTC or ETH.
Pic unrelated - just funny lol.
The only one that will go on an ETH tier bullrun is Link.
Short term gains, maybe Powr.
but that shit coin POWR and ride LINK and REQ to the moon and beyond.
Maybe add WTC

I know they think that I shouldn't still hodl you,Or tell them that.But if I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt itWhere's the sense in that?I promise I'll just shill you even harderJust return to the price we wereBut I will go down with this shipAnd I won't put orders up and sell youThere will be no big dump you just ask forI'm holding bags and always will be
You have max 2 hours before the rumor about Bittrex listing LINK spreads like wildfire (especially since it's probably true).
LINK should have a 20% bump immediately.
s-source?
REQ has greater potential, and a better dev team, than LINK.
I hold both but REQ is the strongest candidate for an ETH run.
If there are really people on /biz that do not hold link they should just quit now because here in 3 months every fucking thread will be laughing at how eveyone told everyone here to get in.
Pink Wojaks will be plastered on the board when Link hits $1 KEK FOMO bitches - better get in real soon - this is not a drill
Half of 4chan by now and reddit.
WTF, open your eyes....
Do say that to me, i had to pick between req and link and picked linked dam it
drop PWR and QSP and do 50 / 50 REQ and Link.
I added RLC to the mix because I think it will be just as bright in the future.
I can tell you what to do, but I can tell you what I am doing.
I recently sold all of my precious metals and am waiting for the bank wire from kitco so I can go all in on link.
dont say that to me
