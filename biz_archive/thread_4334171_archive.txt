I finally cut my losses on BCH.
Have a feeling it might go sub 1k in a few hours.Lost more than 50%.
Learned my lesson.
Not gonna be greedy again in the next time.Thanks for the memes, /biz/.
They help me during these hard times.
See you in hell jihan, I'll be waiting... with my bags.
in the same boat but glad to be done with it
Lol sameI almost x3 my investment but nope, I'm a retard and ended up losing a lot
Korea's FSC is investigating the unusual trading and market manipulation that occurred on their exchanges yesterday.
Hopefully someone goes to jail over this masquerade, so many gullible people just got robbed.
Crypto is decentralized u ducking retard
Not when a handful of people openly manipulate the greedy herd
4334171yall are idiots for buying in at over 1.1k, it was all too risky and in the hands of one crazy man.
oops
This desu.I've been in and out, made several small gains.
But then I became greedy.
Should've sold it at 2k.But oh well.. we need to learn this the hard way, fellas.
I've been buying this shit since it was 600 usd.
Then rebought at 900 and 1,1.
Everything was going 10/10 until today.
Next time I will just get out as soon as I make good profit no matter how much better I think it's gonna get.
It seems so hard to tell when to get out.
Oh well.
I fucking bought at 0.4 thinking I could ride the pump all they way to the top, I went to buy some things and when I came back I was already down 30%.fuck me, fuck BCH and fuck everyone that backs it
