Man I dont know, somethings in the air.
BTC having this massive pump sure feels unhealthy.
I really cant put my finger on it, but something seems fishy.
Could this be a dead cat bounce?
It's a long term bull trap, 3 day dump incoming
no didnt you hear just hodl until the sun explodes
Sell everything.Now.You were warned.
I've seen this kind of raw pump only once before - it didn't scare me enough then.Seriously though the real red flag for me is that alts and BTC are both rising.
This was also the case right before the September dip.
Obviously that had to do with FUD from China, but I still think the market is primed for a big correction.
Which saltycoiner is behind this thread?
Of course it is.
Just whales and miners pumping the price up to unload their bags to idiots
The calm before the storm of institutional investors coming in and pumping it beyond $10,000.
I doubt theyll get a chance, expect some big news on the week end
Like...?
just call it fud
Im 50/50 split on eth and btc at this point.
But i made $800 on bch , could have made $1200.
So its all good to me
you put your finger in something and it smells fishy?
