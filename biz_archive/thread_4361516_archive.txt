Last chance to get Bitcoin for .2BTC.
I like what you did there
I like it just started rising again
When is the flippening going to happen?
Or did I just get scammed?
Where do you check the price?
It's crashing now on bittrex.
he uses bittrexlol
Next time, search the catalog for whatever coin of week /biz/ is shilling before buying.If thread count , no buy.
Idk how to use bithumb I don't understand Korean and google translate sucks and I think it breaks the interface because I can't see any order book or anything,
what you mean by "crashing"?
it has risen from 0.182 to 0.202
I've only ever used binance, but it seems pretty user friendly.
:)
It's never going above .4 again, that's just us memeing and a few delusional bagholders.
What about 0.25?
bcore is blockstream.
its totally different currency or should we say asset since its terrible to use as money.
Boy are you going to feel silly.
Unless of course you're purposely fuding, in which case 0/10.
No one cares if you can't say WHY.
just give me a chance to get rid of mine for 0.235 please
When lamboland
sell at .21 buy at .19 repeat till friday and hold through sunday to sell at ath
idk if it'll rise with such volatility but as long as what you /out/ for, if the usd equivalent is more than what you paid for them, you're in the green.
so just hold till it goes up a bit.
Don't fomo/panic.
Not how it works.
I'm losing btc by holding this therefore I losing money.
it's not even going to 0.21 anymore.. been in the 0.20xxxx constantly for the last couple of hours.this.
my biggest fear is if i miss the alleged btc train to 8k or 10k
