The token that refuses to get listed on exchanges and BTFO of their own investors when they asked about it, basically saying if they invested to see price increase, they shouldnâ€™t have?

Catmeowrines are the best, they support a young team chasing their dreams AND will get huge gains as a return on top of this.
I can not understand why this is so under the radar, when the chinks see CAT they gonna love it, just accumulating till binance now.
