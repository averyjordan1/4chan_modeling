>tfw gf makes more money than me
and why is that bad ?
>gf
If my GF did not make more money than me I would accuse her of being an antifeminist stooge to the patriarchy and dump her for a richer woman.
Quit your job and live off her.
Men and women are apparently equal now and gender roles are social constructs so she can't complain about you adopting the stereotypical female role without outing herself as a misogynist bigot.
Unless her instincts kick in and her brain find an excuse to leave you.
It's like they're so predictable you can't take them seriously anymore.
I just basically ignore every word that comes out of their mouths.

Better marry her, gf is about to moon.

Only acceptable if she is a famous actress or other celebrity.
If that's the case then you are the cool outsider.
Otherwise, make more money or contribute in the relationship in other ways.
Fixing/building things, cooking (has to be delicious), or get her parents to love you.
I seriously have begun to enjoy watching the predictable behavior patterns play out along with the subsequent back rationalization.You can trust a woman to be a woman ;)
>marry rich gf>immediately quits her job after honeymoon.
You better fix that by working smarter you emasculated cuck
when you hold your bags so long you become the bag yourself

She will leave you for a guy with more money in the future.
