I just got an airdrop in Binance.
500 free shitcoins.
Does this happen often?
Do other exchanges do it?
was it trx?
i got em too and you cant trade them because the value is too low for that fag exchange
ya TRX.
is this their way of paying us to shill for them?
Lowest it has been in about a month.
Maybe they are just being friendly and alerting us to the dip?
