I'm pretty new to this.
Should've sold BCH at 2,000+, but I can't complain.
Still doubled my money.
It's sitting in USDT now.
Everything looks erratic.
I haven't slept for 2 days and will wake up in a few hrs to put it back in bch if it seems to be pumping again, but if it doesn't what is a safe bet?
