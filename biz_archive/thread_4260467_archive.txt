How many times do I have to tell you!
this coin will not quit!
holding since $0.8cashed out some today to treat myself for a genius investment
Just dumped what I had.
Feels so good because I almost didnt buy yesterday.
I will rebuy in once it goes back down to 3.45ish.
Though I feel like after that it will never go down below 4.45 again.Screencap this
looks like it quit anon
Reminder that Vertcoin is Tulip Mania 3.0
salty linkcuckI'll wave from my lambo
not breaking 70k tonightnot enough momentumnot tonight senpai
As soon as the 30 bitcoin wall at 70k is taken down its going to fly straight to 85k
i feel like it'll get dumped, many people FOMO'd at 69k, they might want to get out
its run out of steam and there's a huge sell wall from 7-8kexpect it to stagnate or decline and then retry the 7k in a day or so
ok i just keked.
Praise bob and Arise chiKun.
