>complains about stability this will be worth hundreds in a few years if your impatient ass could just wait
invested three times>bittrex goes down>lost 30%>sold this bs>invested into another coin>got 300% back.get out of this bs
traded 8000 vtc for this cuntcoin before the bithumb listing and lost 50%, thought it would recover and then vtc mooned from 35k sats to 80k within a few days.
