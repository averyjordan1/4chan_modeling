So what's the timeline for the upcoming BTC death spiral?
Days/weeks/months?
in 8 hours when the flippening happens
Why 8 hours?
the whales from korean will pump it towards the moon and beyond the flippening is real friend
I think bitcoin obituaries has an accurate timeline for the death

maybe he thinks like "the price needs to +130% for me to recover" that is when you are down like 60-70% of your initial investment
