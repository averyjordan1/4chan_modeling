So after seeing constant posts here and hearing both sides, I've decided to go all in.
Honestly idk what is going to happen.
Did I do it right this time /biz/?
Smart move as long as you can be patient till news is released
It's below $0.20 at the moment, right?Fuck it, you should do it.
Its so cheap you have nothing to lose.
No you fucked it up, you're supposed to buy high and sell low, not the opposite.
Literal lamboticket.
damn nigga you went all in on a russian toiletcoin
It's been shilled here since 52c now it's 15c , you would've been better off holding btc then link since ico.

I invested a small amount (500$) literally just for the meme magic.
I feel by the meme magic that this is going to be the new ethereum, but I'm not as stupid to bet everything on meme magic, so 500 seems a safe bet
If this is for real, I'll be forever grateful.0xc1f9b387125FF35945aE1B2bdabfD0f6206f9252
Rent free lil nigga!
Same I'm only planning to put an amount I can afford to lose.

I'm holding 400 now.
Did I do it right this time /biz/?if you have 2 years yes
How can I buy ChainLink?
I can't open a Binance account, because I had to make new passport and am going to have to wait 2 weeks for it to arrive.I have Bittrex, but ofc they don't offer it..
Which other Exchange does offer ChainLink?
Etherdelta.
Google how to use it first
i just transferred ETH to binance yesterday and bought a boatlod of link.
No passport required what are you trying to do over there??
how much did you buy bromo?I just added another 5000 to the stack, just above 50k now, feeling comfy as fuck
Yeah, I've just figured out right now I don't need passport.
Also general question for a lot of the linkers in this thread, do you guys daytrade it?
If it sits at 2000 sats and goes up just 200 sats thats a 10% gain.
Seems easy enough no?
x4152efAedCa4035f9DE9318ceFE53E5c76076B75Please man
4427051Okay, but how can I now store and transfer my ChainLink tokens to a paperwallet where it is secure with privatekey, backup/encryption?
Or is that only for BTC?
myetherwallet.com

x6cd0791eef2f15008a3fc282dbbf6460f99a678dThx OP, I need this

Forget the original anon there are so many forks now you might as well start trading the forks.
Not all in but I did buy $50 worth at that price.
legitimately bought like 100k at .44
i also think i bought to high but lets try not to worry... in 2 years it wont metter anymore.
ANYONE NOT INTO LINK RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE POSTING PINK WOJACKS ON $1-$5-$10-$50 SCREENCAP THIS FAGGOTS
 #Ok but if i have a smart contract i made on etherdelta can I migrate that smart contract over to myetherwallet or do i have to make a new one?
Why do people buy link?
It was obvious from the way it was being shilled that people wanted to sell it, which meant they wanted others to hold their bags.
If it was so good why did it need to be promoted so heavily?It reminded me of another coin that was shilled a lot about a year ago called mooncoin.
It’s value went down to zero.
Literally.Now, it’s not even clear to me what Link is supposed to do.
It’s got something to do with “derivatives” and an “oracle problem”.
But what exactly does link do?
And how is whatever it does going to create demand for it?
Am I a brainlet or is link just a bunch of hot air?
depends how many you got, if little buy more now, if you have a lot, it won't matter how much you paid in 2019 anyway
Have you done any research on the coin?
Fucking read about it brainlet.
Read about the history of the internet and how that went mainstream and you will come to realize why a decentralized oracle like LINK is huge.
your clueless, its alright tho bro
Link is not for brainlets and i takes days of research to understand it fully if you'r IQ is not 200, thus noone is gonna spoonfeed you with free knowledge.Chainlink doesn't need hype, it's gonna be driven by pure demand in a year
Why do people buy link?>Now, it’s not even clear to me what Link is supposed to do.What the fuck is even
Would wait till it goes back to 10 cents then buy the fuck out of it.
It'll.be 10 cents in like 1-2 weeks time
Fairly sure link is at bottom.
I use it place to store my confirmed gains from other coins.
x2fA57d3E929b7f837e75a53d7355685897f9b2CfFully getting memed on.
Honestly this is why I want to make it big in crypto.
500$ a month here could make me live comfortably.Its not always bad in 3rd world countries.
Where do you live?
This would be the highpoint of my year if you're legit0xbba3b8baDB4DC17766a93618E1A3dc9e73a51b4C
yes you didbe greedy when others are fearful.
Don't chase pumps.
Don't try and time the market.
hold and you will be rewarded.
