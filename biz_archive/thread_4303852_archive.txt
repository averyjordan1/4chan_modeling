BTC is low for a reason- namely a failed scaling attempt for larger blocks and a massive flight of capital into Bitcoin Cash.This isn't ordinary fluctuation.
This isn't "oh gosh Bitcoin went up so fast people took profits and now it's creating a big selloff and it'll stabilize and renormalize".
This could be the beginning of the end, when money permanently exits Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash.
It's obviously easier at the moment for fiat and dumb money to get into Bitcoin than Cash, but with sustained volume and price, you can bet Coinbase will be listing Bitcoin Cash very very soon.
This isn't ordinary fluctuation.
This could be the beginning of the end.Maybe.
I don't know.
I still have my BCH from the fork so I am watching the idoicy unfold.
I hold the same amount of BTC and BCH.
I still think this is pump and dump and that the market will normalize sometime next week.

EPY or just ETH
