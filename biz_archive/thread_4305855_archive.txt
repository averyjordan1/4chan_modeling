CFD about to break $1.
just LOL @ you if you're not in
It had a little pump but dumping again now
>almost 10M for some mediocre idea, a shitty team, no working product, no customers, no adoptionThis is making me lose faith in cryptos seriously.I see projects like Modum who already have dozens of customers in the big pharma waiting for the product to launch in a few months, a demand in the hundreds of millions, a team full of PhD and high ranking workers at fucking novartis, support from government etc that are struggling to stay barely above 25M
4305954>Tell you a thing will make you money at 0.03 USD>BUT MUH PRINCIPLES>It goes to 0.90 USD>I CAN'T BELIEVE IN CRYPTO ANYMOREJust ride the memes dude.
I see promising projects not mooningMarket.
Fucking.
Cap.If the coin comes right out at $50mil it won't pull a 10x without some serious time

It’s honestly the most important thing
This bitch can go to 100 mill market cap.
Wondering if I.shoukd hold or.take my profits and run?
I bought 2 ETH worth at ICO, I would sell, but I want them dividends
Can you explain how the dividends work
 eth worth likely won't net you much in dividends based on what I've read.
Cash out at 20x and reinvest somewhere else
There's a 0.7% fee for using ConfidoThat fee pays token holders.If you hold 12.5 ETH, worth, for example, you'd receive 1% of the total transaction fees.
So if $100,000,000 worth of transactions take place using Confido as escrow in a year, the Confido network receives 7,000,000 in ETH, and a person holding 1% of all Confido receives $70,000
Token holders get the 0.7% transaction fee
With my other post in mind, if you had 2 ETH ICO, then you would receive $11,200 that year.
This was a guaranteed win at ICO.But a shitty whitepaper for an app that doesn't even exist and a team that shares how much they bench on telegram being worth 10mil?Rather not... take your profits retard.
Off by a 0 there anon....
Check that math
So i can pay in BCH or ETH and not Confido?
What’s the point of tokens then if you don’t have to use.....
