tell me /biz/, is it a good idea to buy into LINK today?
Will it go any much lower?
It will probably hit 5 or 10 cents in the coming months.
Or it will bounce back to 30 cents.Good luck.
Fucking scam coin ofcourse it will go lower.

4469036thanks for the insight 
people on this board believe a json parser is the same as ethereum....mfw...
You won't see LINK at today's prices EVER again.You can apply this wisdom to Link every day :D
How is it just a JSON parser?
Nobody knows for sure.
I'm also currently looking for a nice entry price to buy more.If you're in for the mid to long term, like until the beginning of Q3 2018, I'd buy now or split it and buy day after day and get an average price
What else are they going to parse?
XML?
