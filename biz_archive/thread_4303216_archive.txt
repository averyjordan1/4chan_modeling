Hey /biz/, how do I into stop loss?
What exchanges let you do it?
I've never seen it as an option anywhere.
But I'm in a situation now where I'd really like to be able to set it up.
Kraken is the only one I know of that let's you do it.It's disabled rn but should be back up pretty soon.
Bittrex has one too

You just get buttfucked by flash crashes and buy orders if you set stop losses.
set top loss at 80>coins dips to 79>you lose out
Bitfinex has limit and market stop losses.
They also have trailing stop, this is moving the stop loss up as long as the market goes up.But as said by others, be prepared to get flash crashed.
Good to know.
If I was holding some BCH Iâ€™d definitely send it to one of those exchanges and set up a trailing stop loss.
just bought 100k
