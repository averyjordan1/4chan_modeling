My thoughts exactly.
Made decent gainz and I'm getting out.

yes, go and come back with your bag of obsoleted bitcoin core
>mfw BTC is like that cool guy at school who is friends with everyone and is fun to be around but once school ends and everyone has graduated and moved on with their lives he fades into obscurity and has a hard time living in the real world and outside of the domain of high schoolRIP BTC
Honestly I'm thinking of selling my WTC bags im holding now (fuck me) into ETH --> coinbase and cashing out.I feel the same.This is all a fucking joke.
Promised myself yesterday that if BCC would hit 0.4 I would go out of crypto completely.It hit 0.38 just a few hours ago.
Guess this is goodbye.What an obvious market manipulation.
The fork gave the BCC whales millions if not billions to keep pulling this shit every time BTC or alt market takes a small dip.

I come here for this type of good insight.
Keep it coming, don't like the new shitty biz takeover.
sad to see you go, corecuck
What an obvious market manipulation.I'd expect we'll see a lot more of it after this takeover attempt is successful.
People complaining the rich people of the world are taking their money.hahahaahahahahaahahahahaahah literally
