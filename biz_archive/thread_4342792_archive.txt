Hello, faggots.I am rich.
I like money, and I have a lot of it.I sold a commercial estate yesterday and have an extra 100k to put into coins or tokens.
I am already invested in crypto and have a balanced portfolio.
This is just extra capital and I'm willing to take risks.Which coins or tokens should I invest in?
