Why does coinbase make you wait two fucking days to pull your money out of their vault?
because it's a vault you fucking noob
why the fuck did you put it there in the first place.
that's for normie boomers
because coinbase is literally for retards who want to get fucking dickered by their laziness.At this point I'm convinced coinbase pays off other companies to die and whither so they can monopolize on lazy normies.
They screw you over at every corner.
you're only supposed to put stuff in the vault if you don't intend to use it for a long time...so waiting 2 days shouldn't be an issue.
