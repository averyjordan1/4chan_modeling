>the absolute state of /r/bitcoinTell me again, why do browse that sub again?
At this point 'my wife's son' is such a meme that I refuse to believe anyone who uses it isn't larping.
It's a meme for a reason.
There are tons of them and they are all redditors.
These are the people who play DnD larping their miserable existence away... thinking they're on the cusp of advanced human civilisation with early day memecoins
But why not just call the kid your stepson unless you're memeing?
i really don't like those fucking people
These people...
Wow.Implying that you have any right to claim the boy as your own son.Check your privilege and be humble
Looks like that reddit name doesn't exist anymore.
Either it was a meme or his wife's son's father made him delete his account.
nice one op you made me go check, fuck u
Soon enough it'll be,>my wife's son who prefers to be called 'she'We're heading in that direction.
I refuse to believe anyone who uses it isn't larping.That's because you're intelligent and probably reside in the 1st worldThere are tons of themLess than you probably think
It's time for Jews, niggers, feminists, and the other garbage to check THEIR fucking "privilege."
