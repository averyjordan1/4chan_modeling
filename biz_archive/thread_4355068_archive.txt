I thought the difficulty fork was gonna kill BTC profitability and get BCH all the hashrate?You guys couldn't have been wrong, could you?
the new difficulty is meant to attracht hash power in proportion to price.
bch=.2btc so it is working so far.
Everyone needs a bit more time to see if it plays out though.If the price gets pumped and sustained at .5btc than btc difficulty could seriously cripple it for weeks at a time.
