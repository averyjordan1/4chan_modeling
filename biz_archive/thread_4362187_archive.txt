>tfw P&D groups never pump your shitcoins
Think smart.
PnD groups don't just randomly pick a coin and pump it... first they do the pre-pump FUD.You need to learn to identify this and buy during the FUD.
Look for coins that are regularly the victim of coordinated FUD (e.g.
LINK, REQ, COSS, some others I can't remember right now).
Be greedy where others are fearful.
