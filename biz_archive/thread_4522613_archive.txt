Let's be honest, what are the odds Biblepay hodling will pay off once sanctuaries are implemented?

Don't know... Dev had a lot of ideas though, and is very active.
He also sometimes seems like an extremist, but bitcoin also has Luke-Jr.I will be setting up a sanctuary btw.
It worck on TempleOS?Not?So f-ck you Jewish botnet scam!
I like the project but Dev is all the place with implementing ideas.
Some are good but it seems like they are either never completed or done to minimal standards.
He's not interested in normies because everything has a pretty utilitarian view.
I have over 1M so I may do a sanctuary just for the kids, ROI seems unlikely.
