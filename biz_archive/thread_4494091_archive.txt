>take my first big loss>suddenly questioning all my methods (even though it was a fomo, and not a calculated trade)>lose ability to read charts.
Everything looks like hieroglyphics nowMy soul has been JUST'd Why did it have to be this way
This happened to me years ago trading penny stocks.
One day I just got a big loss.
Suddenly all your confidence is shattered hard.
I gave up trading for years after that JUSTening.
God luck man, notice how your finger will be numb when you move to buy the next investment.
Gone is that confident optimisim, replace with self doubt and fear
literally me yesterday when i lost 300 on BTG instead of making 500 lmfao fml

It works until it doesnt.
You win until you dont.
Everybody gets JUSTd at some point.
Dont let it turn you into being too cautious.
My ICO picks have been zrx, link, and confido.we all get JUST'd eventually, anon.

Don't give up OP, please.
the JUSTening
I'm not, I'm just a bit confused on how I should proceed from here
A good strategy is that when your trading is starting to go bad, just stop trading, hold and walk away, but it only works if you aren't holding onto 100% speculative poop but either something backed by concrete game theory, dividends, or events happening within the 2 quarters.
Value investing, nigga.You can also use -10% stop losses to sell at a recoverable point without getting completely justed but it may also toss you out of positions that end up being profitable if you don't watch the volatility.
Use with discretion per position.
hint: you were never able to read chartsyou got luckyits all downhill from hereyou'll take positions too big and want to make up your loss too fast and just go into a downhill spiral that few ever climb out of
this only happens when you trade more than what you can afford to lose
