Did anyone catch the breakout, still looking for NEO and Ethereum Breakout today.
Shameless twitter plug if you want to catch my other charts https://twitter.com/CryptoSlant
FUCK MY ASS.
I sold at .60
Most likely a retraction to 0.65$ due before hitting target 2.
Try find a good entry
Fucking finally, bought this crap and was starting to regret it hard.
Glad I got back in at around 58.
I'm so fucking mad I didn't buy more at 0.30This, bought at 0.50 a few months ago, finally starting to see profit.
To be honest, I still don't understand why I bought it, I read a bit about the company and I didn't really see anything that will make this coin moon.
The concept is quite interesting, if the dev team can pull it off it will be a really strong contender for a top 3 coin.
What sold me on this coin is this representation of the tangle:http://iota.dance/live/I don't really understand it but it looks really cool!
http://iota.dance/live/what the hell is this, i dont understand
>tfw I only bought this coin because I thought the logo looked cool
ETH breakout today??
It shows the Iota network.
imo depends on which way this fakeout/breakout for btc goes
not too bad of a buy tbqh, I can see it reaching ATH sooner or later
NEO is fucking tanking hard, what's going on bros?
