Hey /biz/I'm at my last $2k to my name.
What's the fastest way to working that into $100k to pay off my debts and start a new life?in b4 >link
Buy one pair of 2000$ kneepads.
Suck 1000 dicks for 10$ each
astro on ed
This kid seems more of the 100k dicks for a buck a pop
Two-step process below:1.)
All-in on REQ, wait for it to 5 - 10x by the end of the year>Never had a chance to get an initial pump, it released during the BTC fork shit>A lot of big names are backing it, and it's basically the western version of OMG.
>They're ahead of schedule, and the website to actually start using Requests will be released next month.
It's going to explode.
2.)
After making 5 - 10x with REQ, place into OMG.
>The wallet comes out Q1 2018, finish creating the chain and allowing staking to begin Q2 2018OMG will then go 5 - 10x.
Well Stellar lumens made there first currency conversion as that picks up steam I'd rather be in that desu after REQ.
