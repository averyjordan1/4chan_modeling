This is truly a piece of shit coin
back to 300$ it seems l0li thought this time it was different, so i didn't bother selling at 320$i guess aslong as ICO are raising money and selling eth at market price, it will never go any higher than 350$ at the very bestthis coin is basically just a better version of tethers atm lmao
