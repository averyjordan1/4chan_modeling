It won't be good news.

Itt we wait and discuss the news.
Is this going to be "The News"?
No
NEO TO THE MOOOOONNNN
BBBBBBB-Bump it!AAAAAAA-Alrighty then.CCCCCC-Can't stop me now!
NEO already mooned.
If the news Is good you’ll get back to 44.
However there’s going to be a silent Moon this week with BQX - big news dropping this week.
Expect 2x gains if you want to cut at least half your losses or gains with NEO and jump on early before the Whales move on it.
big news coming this weekKek fuck off this is a neo thread,
is nex going to have a coin?
how do i invest in it?
Lol okay you just thrive off their salty tears and you want them to be bah holders.
I’m trying to give back
It already mooned like 100% in 6 days, no one wants to buy your bags.
You’re a fucking moron.
BQX has been doing nothing but going up.
I can’t even get my bigger buy orders filled because nobody is selling.
I have 10,000+ BQX in cold storage and have only been able to fill 700+ of the 4,000 I’m trying to buy up
