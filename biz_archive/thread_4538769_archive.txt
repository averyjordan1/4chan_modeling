what do people mean when they say a crypto is over sold or over bought?
how are they any different?first of all how can you even tell other than painstakingly counting all the little red/green bars at the bottom?and also no matter how much crypto i sell/buy on the exchange, wouldn't the end result still be the same?
the results are always equal.
>oversoldprice fell too rapidly and will correct up>overboughtprice grew too rapidly and will correct down>how can you tell?with technical analysis
oh, so that's what people meant.
i think i understood the term wrong.
thanks.
