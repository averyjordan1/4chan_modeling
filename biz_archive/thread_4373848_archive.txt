New /biz/nizman here, been lurking for months tho.I bought BTC at the 5500 dip a few days ago and wanna get into ETH as well.. wait for dip or buy while rising like a true FOMO?Im just trynna make enough buck to buy my hentai-frau some Gucci.
ETH has been at this price for months.
It's the only stable coin until now.
It's ready to take off.
Good buy now.
It will become the safe bet in this crypto jungle.
(as BTC was before the BCC fight)
