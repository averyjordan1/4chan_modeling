Okay /biz/ this doesn't make sense.
I see a ton of threads about POWR, LINK, REQ, NEO, XMR, etc.
but I never see threads about these coins.
FlappyCoin had a 5608% moon in the past 24 hours and not a single thread.
Why not?
There are a ton of other coins too like Protean, Fazzcoin, and VectorAI.Why are there no threads about these coins?
I'm not shilling these coins, I just want to know why no one talks about them.
I have literally never heard of them until now.
hr volume: $30.
Also these can be faked with coins with large spread.
look at market cap and supply
You see that 24 hour volume?
That's why.
because the volume is $10.
You're not going to get a lambo unless you're the scammer.
Look at the volume dude

Look at the current trade volume, they're so low.
no one is going to trade these coins.
