With marijuana getting ready to be legal in the summer of 2018 in canada, would it be a safe bet to invest in canopy?
currently priced around 19$
investing in something >that isnt BCHlol, you might as well just blow your brains out right now.
I don't know much about BHC and some are saying its gonna go down or something
bump
DUDE WEED LMAO
 If youre not holding at least 10k POT, youre simply not going to make it.
100x Jan 1st, guaranteed.
what do you mean i'm not going to make it?
i'm slightly confused...Again very much new to all this
anon dont listen to /biz/ they are just salty about link and not hoping on the bch trainbut canopy growth is a really solid invesment i got 5k at 9$ it owns leafs by snoop and 4 other farms, currently the largest weed company in canada has the infrastructure theres ligit no way it can go down until its legal just up
So should go in at 19$ the share?
i think its safe to say that its value will just increase from here, but all stock trading is a gamble still
what about aurora?
Ignore the shills.
Reading up on the stocks, should I invest in canopy (19$) or aurora(4 and going up)?
both seem promising
buy some unpredictable and easily manipulated intangible currency instead of reasonably predictable, legit stocks
He's talking about the crypto currency named POTcoin.
baited, but true
