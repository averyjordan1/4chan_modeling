Give it to me straight /biz/Did i fuck up by not selling at ATH?
I'm no whale, I'm not bcc/btc/bch cuck.
I am an Australian and this is pure Australian POWRRRRRR

Personally I think you did OP
You're not fucked, you just missed an opportunity because it will go down to 7k or 8k sats.
no, i'm not selling until at least 24000sats.
It might take a couple weeks..
Just hold, you'll be fine.
What'd you buy at?It'll be 20000sats by next Friday.
I sold, I had to take the profits I had.
Will get back in if it drops later, otherwise no problem
Yes m88!!!!!
Crack open a fosters and put a shrimp on the barbie for us matey.
We celebrating Aussie style.
Bought at 59 cent, can't tell you the sats as I can't remember Not a bit investment but one of my first shitcoin holds
It's having a tough time dipping below 9.5, I wouldn't sweat it.
Bought in at 8 cents so sitting comfy.
These hands be holding.
Get ruler>Open 15min Graph on Binance>line from bottom of all dips>line from top of all peaks moon mission or death>P&Ds>Zoom out to 30min>same graph after the last big P&D, slow climb now in W formation then up up up she goes.
this is no pump and dump coin op.
If it was it would go way lower after the pump to ATH yesterday.It will recover, might take few days, might do it now.
Depends on news.
Nah.
You could've made a little more profit by waiting but anything under $1 for this is solid.
Just wait.
shut up cunt
