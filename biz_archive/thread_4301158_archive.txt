Let BTC and BCC have it out.If you want your funds to stay safe, Get in here my hebrew brethren.
Of courseStill kinda want some bch but monero will stay my biggest holdCan't wait for next 2x
I'm all in and up several K. They'll figure it out eventually.
Monero is the only real play, everything else is garbage
I SOLD IT TODAY FUCK AS FUCKING RANDOM AS IT GETS AT 89â‚¬IT FUCKING DIDNT MOVED FOR 2 MONTHS AND NOW ITS SUDDENLY DIESRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
30% fund in there, wish i bought more.
So /comfy/ as we ride our way to $200
really pissed i didn't buy when it was below .012. chart looked sexy AF then from its .03 top.... my regrets this week are not buying XMR and ETC last week.
Monaco looks like a good buy, thx for the tip
I've been 80% in monero since the S2X fork was canceled.
Staying comfy.
Damn right.
I'll be buying more at the dip.
