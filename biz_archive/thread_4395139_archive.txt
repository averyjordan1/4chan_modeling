Guys you do realize that when the BTC bubble pops be it soon or a few years from now alts will finally be free from it's BS right?The flippening is still on
btc bubble pops everyday.
Sure eventually something will take the throne, but we're still riding this shit to the top
This is exactly what we do.
In the meantime, we invest in the future new King.
Got my eyes on what I think the future cryptocurrency king might be if everything with it works out, though it's not gonna be out until 2018.
Fingers crossed I'm right (but I don't wanna say what it is since I don't wanna be a shill boy)
But how to know when the BTC bubble pops and to stop investing in the king?
As op said, it could be soon, it could be a few years from now.
Exactly the same here.
Accumulated around 0.1% of the total marketcap so far for my choice.
Moon or death.
I have no idea.
It could be anytime.
That's why I'm slowly diversifying into projects with little short, but huge long term potential.
No ICO shit tokens though.
Well hopefully one of us makes it.
Would be nice to become the 1%
