Lel at watching you crypto fags panic every few days.
Trade like a real man on Forex
>sold 80% of my bitcoins at 926000yenNoice.
Still keeping that 20%, just in case.Going to ride this dip as much as i can.
idiots hop on spankchain only real world use tokenhttps://etherdelta.com/#0x42d6622dece394b54999fbd73d108123806f6a18-ETH
it has none because tethers are controlled by bitfinex.
they froze and if needed, can reverse transactions.
this just people being retarded.
from another thread:Question, Is there ANY way to verify what these kikes are claiming?Could they be stealing 30 million?
who would steal the 30million?
bitfinex?
what's the point?
they already identified the address it is in and froze it.
why would they do that if they were trying to steal it?
and why would they need to go through all this trouble if they can just as easily print themselves 30million without this drama.
Must be your skin that I'm sinking inMust be for real 'cause now I can feelAnd I didn't mindIt's not my kindIt's not my time to wonder whyEverything's gone whiteAnd everything's greyNow you're here now you're awayI don't want thisRemember thatI'll never forget where you're at
people dont scam in crypto
https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/WEBSITE IS NOW DOWNTHIS IS A GLOBALIST SMOKESCREENABANDON CRYPTO IMMEDIATELY
oh sure people do, but why would they need to do all this if they can print 30m tethers?
why print 30million and then pretend to have it hacked and then freeze the hacked address?
>not permanently holding onto your btc/eth for another year or so and being happy that you can buy more now on a fire saleThis is great news as long as you weren't fucking stupid enough to buy at an obviously unsustainable ATH, I've been waiting for this dip so I can spend 85% of my paycheck
how do you know its frozen?how do you know anything they are saying is legit?
none of the tether is moved and the github is rejecting the address.
