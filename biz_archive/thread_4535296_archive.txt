probably the best structured ICO since ZRX.
Anyone else ready and whitelisted for a minimum of instant 3x?
Best ICO of November and such a small marketcap.
Easily 3X on the first day.
tfw got my 1k bought back for 8.5klol at icocucks
lol, that's awesome, I can't believe they offered that to preICO just to protect ICO.
This company is amazing..
Soon people will be laughing at the pre-salers that sold for a small 8.5 profit.
Individual cap is so low :/
We should get two days at least of ICO not everyone will fill their cap first day.
% will happen but that 8.5x is hard to pass up.. they just punishing dumpers in the long run
Froppy approves
it's going to 10 mil market cap so not exactly tiny cap guys, I'm in also, but I only see it doing a Modum of like 3.5 gains in the short term
Whats the individual cap ?
And where can I find info how to participate ?
Iâ€™m in the white liste
When do we recive the link to the Contributor's Interface ??
But as far as I understand wabi coins are just there to give customers a discount why should they grow in value?
Good for a quick flip 2x3.
Nothing else.
But quality shills might push out 5x.
x will still only be about a 30 million marketcap which is nothing for a project like this.
Easy 10x the first week.
10x in the first week hahahahahahaaha
