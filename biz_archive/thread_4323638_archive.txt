what does that means
whales keeping the price down while they accumulate
Jumping into bch

are those walls still there, OP?
Wall raised to $90,830,000
They're supressing the price of the one and only king.
Must be the top investors in crypto that can only do that or a group of wealthy people.
Never thought you could put up sell walls on bitcoin and manipulate its price with its insane volume...
but they haven't been reached yet, right?
We are $250 +- to reach first Million wall and then comes more millions
volume is slowing while the walls are up.
buying up what's left below the walls.
then, once no more volume, remove the walls and blast off.you do the opposite with buy walls if you want to dump.
$10 from first M wall
bch.
don"t miss it.
We jsut hit first million wall, a 300 BTC buy was made, first wall removed, second is there
and price is still holding.
see 
first wall is downthis, if that wasn't the case we would be trading at sub 6k already
and price just jumped $40.
it's about to blast off
$20 from second Million wall.
So price is gonna jump up?
once you see the sell walls gone, it will
1st wall +- $9,591,000after $2002nd wall +- $15,420,000and so on, $ after there are 5 millions wall, 7 now
We are near second million wall, even with all the rest walls, the buy orders are on fire
4324270price is still stable.
BTC will be $8K by Wed.
Won't it go down again like last night?
yup
it may go down some, but nothing like last night.
that was essentially insider trading to make gainz; all the flippening shit was just to get noobs and FOMOers to jump on the BCH train so the insiders could lay their bags on them.
BTC is stable now (all the weak hands are out) and it is poised to rise much stronger.
basically the same cycle for the last year
We may expect big swing up/down between, 9pm-3am London time.
I don't see it going zig zag for more than 24 hours.
