Anons, get in while it's cheap because it's going to moon.
You heard it hereBlockpool created the B2B system through which Bjork's album will be purchasable via cryptocurrency.
Her first video launched today - album launches in 1 week.
Personally i don't listen to Bjork - but Blockpool *a fork of ARK* already has partnerships and working solutions.
This is why this is big.
Get in while it's cheap - or miss the boat!
It has a low supply, and new to Cryptopia.
