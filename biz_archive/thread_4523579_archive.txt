i get all of my financial advice from redditWho is this schmuck?
Why is he a rapist?
Maybe no one cares about these youtubers?Saged
he was a famous vlogger who got accused of rape and lost most of his subs
TLDR: Bought btc at ATH (35k pounds, using his savings and a loan), he fell for the flippening meme, sold all for BCH, tried to day trade like a retard.
Lost almost everything, except for enough money to pay back the loan.
desu the only difference between him and average biztard is that the latter went all in on LINK.
accused of rapeDid he make the mistake of making eye contact with a college girl or something?
He's probably one of those annoying BCH shills on this board.
you sound like you're about to subscribe out of pity
lmaopretty much this
every few months there is a new wave of newfags going all in on the most shilled coin

If that is indeed the case, that would be yet another "Proof of Karma" at work :D
Haha REKT!
>rapistI think at 25yo, at a convention, he asked a 20yo to a lone room and made a move on her.
Not sure if there was physical contact.
Afaik, it was "rape" in the leftist sense, but I might be mistaken and there was as much as forced kisses involved.
Man this guy makes us money and makes us laugh!
Did he start wearing the rapist beanie after the rape accusations?
bumpidibump what a retard
BUMP
forced kissing isn't sexual harassment
More like one of the sad fucks who fell for the shilling.
he was famous so it counts as him acting out of power
yes because being accused of murder makes one a murderer irrespective of the inevitable trial that would have to take place.
He should have listened to this faghttps://soundcloud.com/thecryptocast/ep13
