how could I fucking know about this coin if I don't even know the name
This is the worst shilling thread in the history of /biz/, literally no one here but OP knows the name of the coin.
hahahahaahahahah North korea investedin this shit
I image searched it's called fucking Ties.
Terrible name, project for finding business partners to start a project in cryupto.
Retarded idea, if you need to pay money on a network to find business partners theres a very good chance you lack the skills necessary to succeed anyway.
No thanks.
