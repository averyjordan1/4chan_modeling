Sorry if this is a newfaghish Question, but what are the best trades to look into?
Im interested in Industrial shit, mainly things like metallurgy and welfing, though making shit out of leather seems to appeal to me as well.
I guess I just like the concept of taking raw or useless materials and molding them into something useful.What would you reccomend?
What you like should have nothing to do with what you trade.
Just focus on the coins that look like they will make you money and ignore that you don't like them on a personal level.
Just pointing out interest if that helps, is what im interested in any good?
Metalurgy and Welding?
Metalworking or??
?
