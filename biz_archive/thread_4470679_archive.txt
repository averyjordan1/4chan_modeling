Sigh...BTC is really holding its ground, I'm sure it going to rally to 9K then my altcoins will get fucked...
I think alts are safe.
$10k end of year boy, get ready for mega alt bleed round 2
Considering how bad alts have already dropped the risk vs reward probably favours alts for now
if you're so sure, margin long bitcoin https://www.bitmex.com/register/eLFd4L on leverage for easy money
BTC will range at around $8400, we'll see what's next.
But 10k before the end of the year is unlikely.
this, do 25-100x margin depending on how big your balls are.
Why does my ark and decred keep dropping.
I've been blereding so long now
This.
Alts are getting relatively cheap and BTC relatively expensive.
