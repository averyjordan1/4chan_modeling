I THOUGHT LINK WAS GOING STRAIGHT TO 50 CENTS I SHOULD HAVE FUCKING SOLD
RENT.
FREE,
haha
so did everyone else.
and that's exactly why it didnt lmao and won't in the future.
Everyone is unloading bags as soon as it reaches their buy in price.
I’ve been waiting for this thread, while I fucks were holding I sold for BTC then sold at 7800 then bought back in at 6900 and now you’re saying I can buy link again?
Lol ur the faggots whoMissed the moon
Just by looking at the order books on binance, you would have seen that the price was being propped up by fake orders.
A bunch of 333 and 3333 quantity orders.
Couldn't be more obvious
until they're all gone.
unironically wish the fork was still on so more weakhands get shaken out
Holy fuck thats a lot of red candles
Top kek
It will break through once everyone unloads their bags at buy in price by Q1 2018.
Until then we'll continue to see sideways movement.
Cut losses now and buy some fucking nuls!
Should always sell at least 20 percent when it moons like that.
You can always buy back after it gets to 50 cents then goes back to 35.
