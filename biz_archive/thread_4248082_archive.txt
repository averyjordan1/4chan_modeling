96% people of the /biz/ community, each, are giing to buy atleast 1000 Chancoins.
Can someone do the math here?
Well, given that we have no idea how many are actually on /biz/, there's not really any way to be sureAnyway, i got some already
at $0 per chancoin, that would be a total of $0
True, the price for Chancoin now is $0 if you roynd up to the nearest dollar.
$0,01 is what it is sold at now.
$ per user, thousands of posters on /biz/, i'd say about 200000$i don't know if there's some stats about board-specific unique users but 4chan gets 1,4 million daily unique users.
% are lurkers and the rest 5% are posters.
So, your stats X 19 gets to $1,000,000 at least.
