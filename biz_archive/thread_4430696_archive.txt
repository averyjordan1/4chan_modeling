I started with 20k USD.
My portfolio is currently:125k XTZ11k MTL 2k XMR500 NEO2 BTC
Bought ethereum at 8$ and kept accumulating for over a year and a half.
Sold the top at 400 after bancor ico, went 50/50 Antshares btc and the rest is history.
Started with 20,000 and kept buying more with paychecks now I just hodl and keep working at my job.
.4k in June Folio worth 10.4k now
started with 5k, made 30k, reinvested after a time about 7k.and ended up with 0.05BTCAnd i am not a guy that only bought shitcoins and cant handle money in real life, but i came to a point where i lost control and never thought that would ever happen to me, but it happened.I lost, because i made a series of wrong descisions.And it can happen to everyone...Friend of mine started early about 3 years ago and is now abou 800k heavy, He had much more money, about 2million and lost 1.2million in crypto.Trust me you can loose 10k as fast as 10$.
£1500, £22000 now.
Don't get tempted to hop on to pump and dumps and you're golden.
I lost 2btc between 2014 and 2015 'playing the market' not realizing I was getting greedy and going for those sweet 20x gains I was promised by various shitcoin founders.
this is 100% not trueplease anon, share with us how you lost 30 thousand dollars without buying any shitcoinsim waiting
I had some spare change after a purchase which I started invest in crypto to learn the market with, which was about $20, that $20 is now up to $45 after a week, so I'm learning the ropes.
In a week I'll be getting some money which will see a $100 in investment, so my starting capital will be whatever my $20 is worth then + $100.
$100Now I have $120Been trading for less than a month
$2,500 > $2,800since monday
$25 in June$47,000 now
>Started with 20k.>Turned it into 70k in less than 3 months .
>Back down to 20k again.
Be careful and HODL is all I can say.
And remember to cash out every now and then.
$400 now $1747.52
I would not declare btc, eth, neo... as shitcoins, i bought too high and shitted myself and sold low.
Especially during the first fork and second before BTG and segwit2x i lost the most :(and yeah, my own fault.
As a someone who is new to crypto, can some of you who have done well share your strategies?
Do you invest in alt coins and then cash out your gains then leave your gains in BTC or ETH and then re-enter another alt where you can make quick gains?
$350 on two video cards.$30,000
125k XTZHello fellow tezos holder.
Do you think that it's ever going to happen?
learn trading psychology so you dont spazz out when something doesnt go to planhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg4YzRhILFE
What I am going to do after I invest more money (I'm  btw) is the following.I will, after great consideration keep about 40% in BTC depending on the price I buy it at, then i will after great consideration invest in long term alts that I think and have researched will do well, and the remaining 20% to day trade and try to make big profits with.All the profits from those 20% will go into increasing the alts, so I will rarely cash out and keep accumulating alts that I think can make it in the long run.If they don't and I lose most of it, I still have 40% to either invest again with a better strategy or keep in BTC.
Put in $1100 so far, down to $850.
Would have been a little ahead if I hadn't tried to grow my measly neo stack and instead ended up selling at the very bottom of the dip a few months ago.
Bought in right before the huge crash in June, if only I had waited a couple of weeks or, conversely, started a few months earlier.
What are you mining?
Ironically I earned over half my BTC from RS goldfarming
$10k start$72k now
Nothing now, I bought them and mined in 2014 and then didn't sell anything
How?
$300 Now $550

New to crypto.
Turned £200 into £150,000 ten years ago trading leveraged gold during the financial crisis and have slowly built a £500,000 portfolio across all asset classes.Started in crypto just this year and hold only 1.5 BTC.
Not enjoying the crypto space at all.
Too much vol on zero news.
Too many shills.
It's like the fucking Wild West in here.Planning on slowly building BTC position and plan on getting rich slowly.Rocket to the moon if you wish, but what I discovered in 2008 is it's better to walk and make sure you get there than rocket to the moon and risk exploding.
400 -> 6100$ since September 17'
Just browse the altcoin announcement forum and you'll find hundreds of them.
Back when I was joining them there was only a few and they could net you a lot of money but now everyone's doing it so the chance you get into a good one is rare.
You can still make like $20-100 even out of the shitty ones.
17k60k now
Similar here.
I sold my deeponion airdrop for $5000.
Not exactly at peak but close, still wish I waited a little longer since I could have had $6500 from it.
started with $7000now have $8500, only because of the NEO spike
I noticed they changed the rules now because everybody dumped and now they aren't getting a lot of interest, they are doing BTX style airdrop now, I'd contemplate buying back in if I wasn't banned lol
like $4000, now 11,500.
A few minor mistakes, such as selling NEO early, and investing in shit coins like Bancor BAT and Aragon, made me miss out on a lot of gains.

You're far from alone anon.-2012Only dark net markets need this.This is some kind of ponzi right?Wow look at Mt Gox glad I stayed awaySnoozeHey this is starting to recover.
Maybe it's time to actually read up.FOMO has kicked in hard and here we are.
Me.
The pain never stops.>that moment when you realize all you had to do in life was buy and hold BTC
bout 6.5k total, round 20k as of now
k, somewhere around 30k.
And to think that if I hadn't fucking sold my Monero, I'd easily have 150k right now...
Started with 300 and now up to 8000.I just all in hyped ICO and take x3 safe profit within the first hour of listing.
Then:>$1500 worth of btc (about 0.5) -> bought 5k MIOTANow:>Traded shitcoins all the way down to 0.15 btc which is about $1200>tfw could have had $3.9k by just holding btc>tfw could have had $4k by just holding my IOTA
Put £5000 in between middle of August and end of September.Played around not making or losing much.One point I had £22000 worth of Obsidian (when it was over 20k sats) and made the mistake of not taking profits.Ended up with around £10000 left.
Took the orginal £5000 I put in out.I put my remaining 1.3 Bitcoins in Airswap and ended up with 0.86 BTC.
I'll never trust Anime chan ever again.Turned the 0.86 BTC back into 1.35 Bitcoins thanks to Asch.I remember holding these Bitcoins and then dumped when Segwit2X was cancelling.I panic bought lots of NEO and GAS, which were both doing poorly for the last week.About 36 hours ago my total portfolio was around 1.1 Bitcoins.
It is now 1.8 Bitcoins.

I'm not concerned with the legalities surrounding the Tezos project.
Honestly I wouldn't even care if they delayed the release because once it's finished it will be one of the most secure and advanced blockchains on the market.
Arthur Breitman has worked at Google X, Goldman Sachs and with a machine learning group.
I honestly believe he will give Vitalik some tough competition once the platform is released.
Mid October put in £1,500Now £2,300Portfolio is LINK, ETH, Confido, Astro, some one unreleased ICO.
The sad thing is I set up a fucking coinbase account in early 2013 and never bought any bitcoin.I scoured through all my old emails but nope, just set it up and never bought any.What a wanker.
Not quite the same as you but iktf: I knew about bitcoin in 2010 but I didn't buy in until 2013.
If I had ... :-(
