Up from .0008 to .001 since my initial call.
ICO price was .0014 - This shit will explode.Here's the research literally done for you, feel free to verify on bitboost.net white paper and check linked in of team membersNew GEM - A decentralized marketplace (aims to be THE decentralized "Ebay").
Already has a WORKING PRODUCT (beta is live).
Engage in e-commerce business without the high fees and privacy issues.CEO is Paul Mahone (Harvard graduate).
He was previously the CEO of Molecular Robotics, the first nanotechnology company to be listed on NASDAQ.
The attention to detail in the white paper and professionalism of the team is top notch.Presale price: 0.20$ (.0006) / ICO price: 0.46$ (.0014) / Current price: 0.28$ (.0009) - The current price is a steal imo.
Total supply: 100m (92m locked for ATLEAST 1 year in case project needs funding to scale).
That puts circulating supply at around 8m / market cap 2m.If another token sale is to occur, it will be SIGNIFICANTLY higher priced.
This information can be found within in white paper.
And get this, it is NOT officially listed by ED!
And it is NOT yet listed on Coinmarketcap!
We are truly the early adopters!The $GEM is BitBoost ($BBT) / Bitboost.net to DYOR / https://etherdelta.com/#BBT-ETH / This is NOT financial advice.
/ Buy & sell when you see appropriate.
/ My personal strategy is to buy & hold until atleast ED & CMC listing / Take responsibility for your own decisions.
How do you figure it's not officially listed by ED?
There's a ticker and everything.
Yeah I think that was a mistake in the twitter guys research.
I didnt write it lol, but i verified most of it and its legit.
is it in ed yet?
