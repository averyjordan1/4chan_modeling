Does anyone know of anyone who literally went to live in the wild because of wagecuck life?
feelsgoodman>Get paid>Be social with co-workers>Get insurance>Have schedule to follow, giving my life structure>Still trade meme coins and stocksYou can have the best of both worlds, anon
This tho.Although i still need some work on the last departent
We all do, anon, it's good to have something to improve yourself on.
It's healthy.
Have schedule to follow, giving my life structureI agree with you on everything except this.
It might only be true in certain cases, with me it's absolutely necessary, my life falls apart if I don't have something to get up for in the morning.I'll start staying up until 4-6am playing games on steam or talking to internet friends, I lack self discipline, I'm learning though, having a work schedule just helps give me that extra boost.Also since I work every week day I'm waking up naturally around 6-9am which makes me feel better, I hate sleeping until 12-2, it makes me feel so useless.But it might just be me.
It's important to know yourself.
