There is literally no one selling, only buying
if no one is selling it, then how would you buy it?
>buying at ath pricesI'm good.I'll rebuy at .15.
Sold 50k.Buying back at $.14.
We're gonna make it brother.
I can feel it too, after all
The same people who wont buy now are the same people who keep whining why they don't make any money in cryptoStay poor pajeets
Made almost 40% today ahahahaahahahah
What do you think would honestly cause this shit to drive up?
It's fomo.
Their beta is still on track for January, nothing else really changed.
I 100% think it's going to be big but calm the fuck down m8.
This is the pump.
People who buy in now run a huge risk of getting dumped on.
congratulations anon, but you only "made" it if you sold it
