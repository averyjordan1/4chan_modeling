Alrite, appears that Im stupid, have problems understanding when and why I should short.If i wanna collect interest I can open 2 positions on bitmex, which one should I short on Bitmex?
IF I think the price of btc is going up should I then long futures and directly short swaps?
this way I dont lose any btc and also collects the funding rate.
I got 2 accouns on bitmex, maybe I should instead go long and short on swaps on different accounts?
granted I need to watch the liquidation price since the correct position cant fund the other one
I want this girl to slav squat on my face
I think you should leave Bitmex to professional traders.
If you can't understand the basics, why are you even thinking about trading derivatives?
You're going to get raped by smart money
That will cost you 2 btc
