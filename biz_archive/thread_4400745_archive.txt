why are some coins rising in USD price but sinking in BTC price?does this mean I should buy bitcoins and then buy the other coin?
yes.
ashamed i share a board with your kind
explain pleaseI'm a tourist from /pol/ and I voted for trump so my IQ is pretty low
They're not growing as fast as btc you autist
alts are weighed in btc so naturally if btc pumps most alts are gonna lose their value in btc but if btc pumps more than a certain alt dips, it will still rise in usd value.
MAGA
No.Buy bitcoin and stop there.
I'm still wondering if that means buying btc and the using the btc to buy alts is really as profitable as it looks compared to just buying with fiatXMR for example, I was considering
This.
Why would you bother buying one then the other, it's the same different, you just lose money in transaction fees
Because BTC is rising (more).
BTC/altcoin shows you a direct comparison of the two in regard to their fiat development.
if the alt pumps at a higher rate than btc, then yes it would be more profitable.
say you buy xmr and it pumps 5% in btc value over 2 days while btc pumps 2% over 2 days.
if you bought btc then xmr with btc, you would lose a few bucks due to transaction fees.
its not that complicated lad
Imagine BTC is 25$ and LINK is $5, which is 0.20 BTC for 1 LINK.
Then BTC value rises to 100$ and LINK to 10$.
This would mean LINK value is rising in USD, but since BTC value also rose now you get 0.10 BTC for 1 LINK.In the end it doesn't matter if you buy BTC and then LINK.
You pay the same.
final question:if the fiat and btc lines diverge greatly, which one is the more accurate description of it's growth?I suspect fiat but not sure
btc is appraised in fiat.
how would they diverge when btc derives its value from fiat
there are a gorillion examples in cryptomarketcap right now, see LTC for instance
