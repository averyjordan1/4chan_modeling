Ark has been on steady support for 2 months about now and I have the tingling in my ass it's about to go the fuck up, I know it's not cheap right now but maybe I should buy a little more... Because why not.
Engines could light any moment
WHY DONT YOU SEE IT
Ummm, BTC is going to 10k next which will crush alts again.
Careful my ARKie brothers
Decided against buying more even though I'm pretty sure it's gonna go up.
I'm already all in and would have just liked to round up my number of ARKs.
I'll just buy again after it's a little lower, better to not take the risk now.
I'm anyway going to make a lot of money soon with it.
Always bought bitcoin when it's high and don't wanna do it again now.
Ok changed my mind, fuck it.
Got my nice round number and can't wait to see ark at 6$
Kek, what's your "nice round number"?
did anyone screencap the 4333333 post?
I have 10k+
Lucky bastard, 3250 here, hoping to get to 4-5k by year's end
4222222
in that case
Whoaaa.
Double sextuplets for Ark.
