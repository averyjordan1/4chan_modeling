So i am just trying to learn a bit about TA and was wondering which kind of studies you guys use !I used RSI for the first time and was able to buy the dip and sell in the reverse BUT i sold to early, i took 5% but could have had almost 10%.I am wondering if this was just pure luck or could i have roughly estimated to where the reverse uptrend would go ?The scenario was POWR.I saw it going into oversold at the 1 and 5 and 15 minute bar and as soon as it was inside oversold at the 30 min i jumped in at 8800.Sold a few minutes after at 9215 for a smal 5% gain.And what now ?
its hoovering underneath overbought atm, do i just wait till its back at oversold to flip it again or is there some other way for me to roughly estimate what to do ?I appreciate anything usefull you guys have for me !
