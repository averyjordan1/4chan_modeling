>'The minimum price fluctuation will be $5 per bitcoin or $25 per contract.
'What the fuck, what's the minimum tick size?If it's a dollar this thing will be total murder.
They need to announce a mini contract or this is fucked from the start.
It's like the DAX on crack.
Brainlet here, why does this mean something is fucked?
Who or what is fucked exactly?
Please explain what it implyI just think i know that will only be able to bet on the bitcoin price and they're not directly buying it, that's all
This is the new CME futures contract on bitcoin.
It's like buying five bitcoin on margin, but you're just betting on the price, up or down.
There's no info on the minimum tick size.
If it's a dollar, the average small move on a three minute chart would be 1500 dollars per contract.
Not even institutions are going to be using that.
Anybody have info on what the tick size will be?
Maybe five dollars, ten?
Not even institutions are going to be using that.
why is it because its too volatile or the opposite?
kek pls help a brainlet
Yes, this will be the most volatile futures contract in the world.I was looking forward to this but they fucked it up, I imagined they'd create a BTC emini and it would be scalping paradise.
most volatile futures contract in the worldKek wait so lets assume that it would be that way, which is more likely?
that this wont be approved or that it will be approved but institutions wont use it.
It's going to happen, but at those prices it will just be an institution playground and pink wojack graveyard for the few brave idiots.
