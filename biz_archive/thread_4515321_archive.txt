I told you all yesterday that Blocktix would moon and it did by 74% and I believe the same will happen to this one soon..
This one could be the next.
Buy now while it's cheap.
Check out the coinmarketcap.
Could be good to unleash my bags
It's incredible how a small change in my strategy has proven to be so effective.
It's pretty simple and I'll share.
Just buy the coins that peaked, then dropped and held relatively steady.
Hodl them and set the conditional sale to sell whenever you gain like 50% rather than being greedy.
I've made real good money by spreading my investment across coins that show that trend.
My recent picks have been storj, clubcoin, 0x, quantum resistance, blocktix, and a couple other ones I can't remember.
You'll notice pretty much all of these follow that trend.
They peak, drop hard, then hold steady before mooning (if even a small amount), but it's paid off well.
This is a good strategy, but choose coins that have long term potential.
0x is one of them.
Not every coin that crashes will come back up.

I still have half my bag from ICO, sold the other half profits to play withComfy
That's actually pretty solid advice.
I did the same stupid thing on all my alts where I bought at the initial peak, which was followed by dumping, steadiness then moons.GVT, HST, REQ and ZRX were the tokens I bought all before the dump lmao
