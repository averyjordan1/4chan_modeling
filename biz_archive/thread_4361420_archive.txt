SOLAR COIN IS DOA.
TRUMP IS DEFUNDING SOLAR / WIND AND TRANSFERRING THE MONEY TO FOSSIL FUELS PRODUCTION.
WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH IT OR NOW DOES NOT MATTER.
SOLAR IS DEAD.
If it's no longer GOVT FUNDED then it can be put into the private sector for deregulation (ie most states will allow corps / individuals to sell it )
Storj is actually the Teeka PBC Fav.
Solar Shills are kust trying to offload bags after the solar defunding news hit.
Permitting for these projects is being cancelled, dumbfuck..
Doesn't matter how much blue sky promoters scam stupid investors in to solar, YOU CAN'T BUILD IT.
It's ALREADY PROFITABLE, you fuckin' mook.
Why tf are we subsidizing ANY of this shit?
COALCOIN WHEN??
This.
Holy fuck.
I'm going to buy the domain and round up some investors.
HELLOOOO, its SLR u FUCKS
Complete Bullshit.
Nowhere NEAR profitable.
Doesn't matter if it was.
Construction of wind and solar farms permit applications are no longer being accepted for review.
It takes 7 years for the process as it is, with all the Environmental Impact Assessment drafts and all that bullshit.
Full disclosure; I was caught up in a similar renewable energy scam in the oil crisis of the late 70's.I was CEO of the Project.
When it collapsed, just like it is.
People lost billions.
I lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which was millions back then.
Buy STORJ right now, and you will recover all of your money you lost in the 70's.
Vitalik Transfer has begun.
I get that your birthdad didn't finish high school & this is what he is telling you.
But you have to realize that your mom moved on because she needed something stable and better.
Ask your stepdad about this when you guys go to Home Depot tonight.
He might use the word bipolar in a round about way when talking about your birthdad and how he interprets news differently than others, but he's a good dude.
And he loves you, kid.
They'll make sure you're taken care of, buddy.
I was a CEO when you were a gleam in your autistic Daddy's eye, Shitstain.
Holy shit those SLR bags are heavy.
Thanks for the heads up on this storj moon mission.
Great catch.
looks like it just started, Went All In.
