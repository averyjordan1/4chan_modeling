For real tho.
This is one of the strongest projects in the cryptosphere right now.
I'm super bullish on this coin, and you never know when it's going to spike...
But it will.
keep telling yourself that but it doesn't change the market value.
Where can I buy BlueArk?
If you zoom out on the price chart, you can see the pattern of huge spike followed by reallllly long correction.
This is due to the dev team not giving themselves deadlines, but rather just releasing things as they occur.
Give it time.
>tfw literally about to put my life savings into ArkHere goes.
I figure it's better to take a once in a lifetime chance like this now, and I really like the project and its extremely high potential.
