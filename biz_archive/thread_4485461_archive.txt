You Guys think it's ever gonna go somewhere ?
Feels like a sinking ship.
Holding and hoping ...
i hope it will go up a bit one daydoubtful though, devs seem to treat it like a hobby project
Pajeet
Yup.
No news, delays ... sad .
Really like the project - guess we wait and see.
Hopefully the guys come through next year.
i hope so
You had 1k XVG right?
Isn't that like 10 bucks or something?
i had 5k in the beginning, sold off 4k when it tanked to around 100, still holding 1k yesim not a rich girl
Why didn't you sell 10 sats ago?
If you hold long enough you'll see your money back someday.
Unless the devs go full Pajeet and the exchanges delist the coin or something.
Since I'm such a goodgoi and promised you your money back I deposited 20 bucks worth of eth to your wallet, should be there in a couple of minutes.
Thanks for the fun threads bud.
Hopefully the 20 bucks worth of ETH will bring you luck
wow, hontoni arigato, hst-sama~i really hope hst works out for you
Once you get rich hopefully you'll repay poor old CONFIDO'd me.See you tomorrow, if you'll still make these threads that is.
