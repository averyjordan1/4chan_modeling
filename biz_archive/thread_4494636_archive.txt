BUY BUY BUY NOW WHILE ITS CHEAP

Deadcoin
We're gonna be so goddamn rich next year.
I've been compiling a bunch of NOLINKs comment, and the collage is gonna be so hilarious to look at.
There are people on this board who haven't bought LINK, and willingly wants to stay poor.
Oh linkies.
What would the world of cryptocurrencies be without you?
What do, we owe the honour.
The promise of Link seemed glimmering at first.
The premise of 'rent free' was surely innovative and ahead of its time.
But, as time showed us, this coin was nothing more than a pump and dump that inadvertently created the most deranged community of bag holders known to man.
A community that incessantly screeches "rent free" whenever they feel threatened, which is very common.
To be a linkie is to be deranged.
Having lost everything, whether it be your house, marriage, wife's sons college money or life-savings surely takes a toll on the mental serenity of a linkie's mind.
Slight threats critiquing the developers of Chainlink sets the common linkie into a state of neurosis that can only be cured by euthanasia or the eventual revaluing of this godforsaken currency.
However, once the price reaches 10 cents, the value will continue falling.
This crash will be catalyzed by the fact that thousands of wallets will be lost as a mass suicide of linkies, causing the price to dip even further.
Don't be deranged, don't be a linkie.

Don't be deranged, don't be a linkie
I really think Link has great potentiak, and that is why I own 1/10k of the supply, which I plan to increase signifigantly in the future.
My only concern is that it may take a year to moon.
this, get fucked fat tranny loving linkies
link LOL >invests in link expecting long term returnHAHAHAHA
I don't own any.
But this looks like the time to buy
((-5%))
Come on FUD team drop this to 10 cents so I can buy
id say the same judging by the ammount of fud in the past few hours
tranny lovingis this true?
Okay /biz/ this doesn't make sense.
I see a ton of threads about POWR, LINK, REQ, NEO, XMR, etc.
but I never see threads about these coins.
FlappyCoin had a 5608% moon in the past 24 hours and not a single thread.
Why not?
There are a ton of other coins too like Protean, Fazzcoin, and VectorAI.Why are there no threads about these coins?
I have literally never heard of them until now.
thats because biz is autistic and terrible at investing.
It has a fucking $84 24h volume It could pump 10,000,000%, but it doesn't fucking matter if there's no volume to it
he didn't all-in FlappyCoin
H-how.
