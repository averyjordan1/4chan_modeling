Who else depressed because they chose not to participate in confido due to thinking it's a scam?Contemplating suicide, that shit would have doubled my portfolio
I fucked up too.
I lost my job three weeks ago and have just been full time investing in crypto.
All my money is tied up in shit I can't access right now because of a fucked up memo input when I cashed out XLM and a few ICO's that haven't dropped yet due to delays.
Don't be a pussy.
Accept your losses and move the fuck on.
move on, life continues
Remove emotions from your trading decisions noob.
I got whitelisted but didn't read it was first come first serve

Wow you're definitely not a confido holding shill.

WHAT IF.....i'm not saying you should do it...but WHAT IFFFF....instead of wallowing in self pity about "muh missed gains", you start researching upcoming icos that might have decent moon potential and invest early in those?
