are there any resources that actually test shit like ichimoku using past data and find it would have been profitable to use, or is this shit just complete astrology?
These guy draw waves and when they end up wrong it's "oh I misidentified these waves" not my methods are BS
try tradingview.
I've backtested ichimoku using a few commonly advertised settings.
A lot is still open to interpretation since there around a half dozen buy and sell signals and they all come in weak, medium and strong versions.
You have to distill all that down to "buy now" and "sell now" using code instead of your intuition.Anyways, I think I've worked the signals a lot of ways and they all uniformly suck dick on those default settings.
When I let it pick random-ass settings (shit like 7, 45, 130, 67 or whatever - just an example) it sometimes comes up net profitable.
I typically require 2 strong buy signals to buy in and 2 strong sells to sell.
But it's not huge profit, and most of it vanishes when I switch out datasets - evidence that I've just been overfitting.It hasn't been compelling enough to port over to live trading with yet.
what do you use for your 'experiments'?
it's an algorithm written in PHP.
I grab the backtest data from cryptocompare.
