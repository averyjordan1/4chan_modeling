I'm so sick of this fake fucking bitcoin cash bullshit.
God damn these markets really make your hair fall out.
Bitcoin cash is the true bitcoin
FUCK HOW CAN I SLEEP WHEN THE FLIPPENING IS HAPPENINGAHHHHHHHHHHHWHERE TO SET MY STOP LOSS ?!??!
trading with a stoplossNever gonna make it
bitcoin is congested.
is it a good idea to buy eth and use that to buy bch?
then switch back to eth and put it to another exchange and buy btc when this blows over?
bittrex has an eth pair.
ive been using it.
it is almost 100% bot traded.
its super obvious on that pairing.
but it makes it kinda easy to see where its going.
im up 2 eth daytrading today from it.
AHHAHAH SO BUTTHURT JUST KYS ALREADy LMAO
how fast is eth transaction?
i want to short my 1 btc and trade it for eth then move all my eth to bitterex and ttrade it for bcc.
then when the time comes, move it back into eth and move my eth back into gemini to cash out.
eth is fast as fuck.
it just takes 32 confirmations from bittrex.
not terrible.
Yeah or LTC, don't use BTC right now, your transaction will take hours or days to get through.
