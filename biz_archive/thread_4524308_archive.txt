whats up /biz/let's talk indicators, entry/exit signals, trends etc.fundamentals are great, but chasing pumps when theyre happening only allows for a small, late entry to then get dumped on if you dont take profits.what are some favorites biz is using atm to buy low and sell high?
Never used indicators, I think they're pretty bullshit for crypto.
I always did very good without any tools or TA expect knowing where the reistance was and phycological barrier.
HODL brodo you look for undervalued, low market caps and make your entry and then hold?
how long do you wait on a coin before no price action up to get out?
