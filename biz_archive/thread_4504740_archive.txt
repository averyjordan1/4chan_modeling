So I get that people might be unsatisifed with BTC and Bitcoin Core.But why does the opposition support Bitcoin Cash?
Is there just no better alternative?Or is this just a huge ruse by the Chinese?
you can't even use BTC for real time transactions are you kidding me not to mention the whole mining fiasco
Because its a better, faster and cheaper version of Bitcoin thats not controlled by the Bilderberger group.I have put all my money on BCH because its pretty clear to me BTC does not have a future.
Seriously, I withdrew my BTC from bittrex and paid a 0.01 miners fee for it.
Its just absurd.
Say it with me:Bitcoin CASHCash = Cash money chinks love anything with a name like cash, platinum, gold, deluxe, plus, and normies want it.Bitcoin is already a strong brandname so put the two together and you got a very strong marketable name.
the smart money is moving to XMR
Buy why Bitcoin Cash?
There are plenty other options.Is it because so many BTC holders received it for free?

human psychology.
people don't trust a king that has been in power for too long.
the art of propaganda makes it near impossible to reign forever.
None of them have the economic footprint backing them of SHA256 proof of work.
Any of them BCH wanted to incorporate the innovations of, it could, and dev teams for it have already said they want to.
