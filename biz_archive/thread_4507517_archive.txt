Oracles, Atomic Swaps, Liquidity, Trustless.Don't say I didn't warn you anon
I'm in.
AirSwap is the closest to launching a much needed functional DEX.
They just launched their ICO at an inconvenient time, very undervalued crypto.
This is going to go hard soon.
So glad that I bought more a few days ago.
I hope they release on a major exchange before the beta.
pajeet.
doesn't realize the absolute need for a functioning DEX>hates everything except money belly>hates money
pajeet: confirmed.
https://blog.airswap.io/introducing-the-airswap-token-trader-c97a840bd82d>Following a development sprint, we’ll be running the full stack internally to stress test, watch the logs, and squash bugs.
We’re looking to start a testnet beta on December 5th with around 40 traders, and upon success, open the beta to the rest of our community.its not releasing to the public on the 5th idiot

kek no one said anything about releasing to the public on the 5th pajeet.
They are releasing a Beta that will be tested and then eventually rolled out to the public.
You must be salty selling your bags at .19 cents ouch!
In from ICO.
I trust these guys.
Oved will make this fly, just like he did with virtu.
Give it time.
actually i never bought this piece of shit coin dumbass
SO SALTY KEK
Well they are releasing their full version in Q1 as well so it is quite clear that this is a good time to get on board.
Long term-ish hold for sure, I'm still bullish on this.
I wish you were bullish on toilets, pajeet.
