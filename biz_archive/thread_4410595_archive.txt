((it)) is happening.
Nothing is happening.

The Yellow Horde poured in, a remorseless tide scouring all in its path.
Yet even the most savage flood must eventually receede, leaving battered bagholders to weep over their ravaged Blockfolio.
"We are saved!"
Corecucks cried, heedless of the fact that tides are certain in one respect: they will always rise again.Corecucks have survived the onslaught, yet now another wave prepares to roll forth from accursed Korea.
BCH bagholders are the most pathetic and delusional faggots on /biz/
