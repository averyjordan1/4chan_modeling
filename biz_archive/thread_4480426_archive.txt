Want to start investing in crypto and I've clearly missed the BTC boat.
I bought around .007 of a coin from a friend who pulled out around the dip but I lack the money to buy any meaningful amount with it sitting near 8k.
Should I invest in cheaper options like Ethereum or litecoin?
What about ripple, which is cheap as chips currently.Help me /biz/
The price doesn't matter, only market cap.
OMG (omisego) is a sleeping giant (undervalued) at around $7 right now.
The cool thing is it trades with btc and eth.
When GDAX adds top tokens next year as is the rumor it could be very big for them.https://twitter.com/jun_omise/status/932859717432500225
I've got a working knowledge if economics but crypto is not something I've got a solid handle on, how is there a market cap on virtual currency?
And if so how is it identified?
Please explain that again like I'm retarded, because im not familiar with most of the vocabulary and acronyms thrown around here

You can view marketcaps for various cryptos and the overall marketcap here:https://coinmarketcap.com/Market cap = supply x priceGDAX is an exchange.
All cryptos have their own acronym, just like stocks.Learn to use Google, and lurk moar.
Be careful of any advice you get here, e.g.
is probably holding some OMG bags.
It is already massively hyped/over-priced, so might not be a good starting point.Out of the three you mentioned Ethereum is the strongest IMO.
If you're feeling brave put a percentage into alts that have potential that are currently down (LINK, REQ).
If you want a good long term hold thats fairly cheap Cardano might interest you.
It's true what he says in that OMG is gonna grow.
But this is a longterm hold.
A conservative amount for q4 2018 I would give would be around 60 each.
I'm biased as OMG is a third of my portfolio, so take it for what you will.
