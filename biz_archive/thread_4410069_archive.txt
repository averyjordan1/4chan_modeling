a fucking cloud
Did I mention?>turing complete programming language
Is any of that shit done or just promisesBecause it looks like a scam
i bet it will net reach any exchange, or maybe only yobit or tradesatoshi
Alright the GitHub looks decent but there's 100m coins and the founders hold 94m of them, hahahaha.If someone forks this bullshit without the 94% premine maybe I'll buy some of that
What the fuck lol >see great looking coin to throw $20 at because if it's not a scam it will be huge % premine
The blockchain is already fully working.
The hardware side of the meshnet is currently underway.It's already on Cryptopiano4410541It isn't a proof of work coin.
"Premine" is the only option.The majority of coins will be distributed through people providing services to the network, (i.e.
packet forwarding/data hosting

They are working on a true wireless meshnet including many different types of devices on different frequencies, including; wifi, 4g/5g radios, sdr, and more.It will also be possible to connect to normal internet IP backbone for backwards compatibility and speed.
I completely agree, this is something we need, and as far as I can tell this team is legit and the furthest ahead on a truly decentralized uncensorable internet.I can see however why people would be hesitant to think it's real, as they are big promises.
