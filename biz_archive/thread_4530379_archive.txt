The conspiracy today is tether is pumping ETH today.
Stay poor.Scared money no money.
In case you haven't noticed, the bch shilling has started up again.
If you're still using bitfinex then you're definitely a huge retard.But what can I say?
Some people just want to be scammed.
Yell at them all you want, they're going to stay on a fucking exchange with no banking backing them up and imaginary tether backing.
Woot.
Yea sorry about all the FUD recently.
I just checked the Tether website and it says they are backed 1:1 with dollars.
Oops my bad.
https://mobile.twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/933726237498970113“The Tether hack required a 3 of 4 keys.
This means that if they had good security, 3 offline computers in 3 different physical locations had to be compromised.
I find this to be unlikely, unless their security is completely incompetent.
