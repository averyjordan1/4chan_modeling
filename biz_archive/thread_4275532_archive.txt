>time's almost up
Any news we should be aware of?
I have about 1k to invest with 3x leverage.
No real news, just institutional pumps.
Have a look at the charts, accumulation is basically finished and the ride is about to begin.
Wouldn't all in just yet for liquiditys sake but 300@3x would do you well since theres 0 downside at this price
Ya, let's pull the plug, poor doge has suffered enough.
The failed fork seems to have accelerated this next doge pump cycle.
Nice to be in it early for once.
Join us, posted a while ago regarding pump plans.
Not here to disclose any more info though.The next pump was gonna be sooner than usual anyway.
the quick dumping on the last one meant target was hit much earlier than expected, and theres no point waiting.
Fork was guaranteed influx, the cancellation just means we dont have to wait for s2x for it to happen
