Feenix coin needs an icon senpai, suggestions?
/biz/ why does senpai turn into senpai, the fuck
Any idea when this is hitting exchanges?
Excited about this one.
OP pic is radical imo.
Gives a real freedom feel.Feenix site says I can still sign up for ICO but white paper says it was over november 9th.
Was ICO ending postponed?I just read your whitepaper and I think this is a really good project and I hope that it gets user adoption.
The world needs decentralizated ways to connect for p2p downloads.Idk if it's possible, but I think content creators being able to sign a specific torrent they make for sharing their creation to give them some portion of seeding pay for all seeders who seed it specifically would be great.I mean, it's not enforcable because people can just download the file and seed again on their own, but if it was possible to see which seeder gave royalties to which address when file sharing, both downloaders and seeders could choose to give the creator of the content a part of the pie.
Looks bad.
