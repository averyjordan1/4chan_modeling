New Coin, 10% Charity CryptocurrencyASIC Resistant like Vertcoin (VTC)Goverance Model like DASHMasternodes going live this Christmas!https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2042657.new#new
How many for a masternode?
Will there be marketing so that Christian groups and churches can get involved?
Perhaps by running their own masternodes?
Thanks!
This for fucking tithing and shit?
500k to 1.5mil BBP for Masternode, lead dev has not decided yet5.2 billion coins by 2050, currently 200+ million in circulation
Currently 171 Orphans are sponsored monthly with the 10% Charity fund
Thanks for your answer.
This project sounds interesting but you link shows confusion amongst the community.
It should have been developed with the idea that Christian institutions would be taking part, have an interest in the masternodes, etc.
I can't figure out how this coin is going to "get there".
