Jihan and Ver are planning a repeat of last weekend.
Make no mistake, these guys are pros.
They know how to employ their resources effectively to multiply the force of their actions, making a series of big buys during dips to stimulate demand and drive the price up to a new level.
This weekend they will dump it all in a series of surgical sells coordinated to cause a panic and then spam the mempool to create MORE panic.
Today we are witnessing an exact repeat of the run up to last weekend.>Chart 1: the rise from 4k to 6k in 1hr candles>Chart 2: the rise from 6k to 7k in 1hr candles>Chart 3: the recovery from last weekend in 1hr candles>Chart 4: today in 5m candlesCharts 1-3 are on the same exact scalePost your evidence here
Got a technical batman in that?
So you're saying we buy BCH?
You're nuts OP.
Not touching that fake bitcoin with even your cock.
I'm in fiat until after the weekend, I agree completely.
Anyone that thinks that was the only BCH pump that is coming is a fool.
If you don't believe me look at the wall on Bittrex that is just waiting to be moved up.
And that over 10k of btc was only worth 55 million last weekend at the bottom of the pump.
Now it is worth 80 million and BCH will be sub 1k.
Incredible buying power is waiting out there.
hm.....now this loks predictable..... do you think they will coordinate it on the weekend like last time?
those sneeky bastards...
