if i have .1btc, why is it worth $830 not $775 or whatever
its not worth 830. if someone is willing to pay you that much for it, sell immediately and rebuy at real price
every bitcoin has a different amount of satoshi essence in it.
your 0.1 btc seems to have a lot.

Not many people know this.
Fuck, so that must mean that Zimbabwean Bitcoins have a lot of Satoshi essence because they are worth about $13k usd there.

Sorry that what makes Bitcoin so unique and cool is that you can never know
couple months back i bought a batch of high-essence satoshis at a really discounted price, guess the guy was new and didnt know about essence.
i immediately resold for almost triple my money
