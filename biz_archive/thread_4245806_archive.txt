What is this madness?
Why are my bean sprouts not accepted?
Anyone else still sprouting beans?
Literally how new?
It usually just means that you’re on a laggy connection (eg wifi) and somebody beat you to the punch and got the reward.Sprouts that aren’t accepted don’t affect your stake weight however so your eventual reward is creeping ever closer in time.
oh i see.
I'm using an old mac connected to wifi in another room.
Just got another failed sprout!
Whats this?
?
