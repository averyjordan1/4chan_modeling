Revain is a review platform that records on the blockchain.
The ico was founded in July 2017 and has seen tremendous growth in price since then.Revains concept is simple, and very similar to steemit you earn Revain through reviewing, the amount of revain you hold somewhat determines how many you will receive.> Why is that important?Its important because when steemit originally was introduced it went parabolic shooting up to 400k satoshi at the time.Now I don't believe Revain will reach 400k satoshi, I do see the accumulation patterns on the cryptopia graph and history as well as a strong price trend to the upside.I think this coin at the latest - end of December could reach and surpass 10k satoshi.
This could also fuel a "moon mission" though it wouldn't be stable despite the iron hands of ICO participants.
