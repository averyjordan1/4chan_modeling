>there are people on this board RIGHT NOW who panic sold their BTC at $5500 and bought BCH at $2800
those same people bought bch at .161 and sold at .139 hahahah SHOW YOURSELVES
Not saying BCH will never be viable, but weak hands seem to love this coin.
Don't worry OP, you'll be panic selling your btc at 2800 for 5500 BCH soon.
Read about chain death and how it is inevitable for BTC now.
Don't worry.
I'll be here to laugh at you when you buy back in at 12k
Honestly I would have almost done it, but then I became rational and thought there's so much buy support for BTC to buy on the dip.
Its a dream coming true to buy on the dip so fuck it I ain't selling and now where we are?
10k by January thats where we are!
Hahahaha chain death?
Do you honestly believe that so many people can have millions of USD locked up in BTC and they're all too stupid to invest comparatively paltry sums in some mining hardware to safeguard their money?
You're fucking retardedChain death HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
>there are people on this board RIGHT NOW who panic sold their BCH at $890 and bought BTC at $8020
I panic sold BTC at 6960, panic bought back in at 6300, and then panic sold at 7880.
I'm just a panicky kinda guy.
Now I'm sitting on fiat and not sure what to do with it.
Buy a rope.
Gonna need it.
>tfw sold BCH at 2300 and bought back in at 870
BCH seems to be a comfy hold right now, it rises every time BTC dips.
Should be interesting to see what happenss when BTC has a large correction.
Sold at 2400 and then put it all in BTC at $5800.
