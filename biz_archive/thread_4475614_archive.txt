bitcoin won't drop under 8k again - 15k by christmas.
get in now or be doomed to poverty shitheads.
only post i'll make on this shit board flooded by pajeets and chinks

>$15kIf we're actually being realistic it would be $10k by end of the year followed by the mother of all FOMO buying after it breaks that which would probably happen in early January
followed by the mother of all FOMO buying after it breakswhat do you think the result of this will be?
i predict a 50%~ crash followed by a recovery and steady growth
I could see it easily going up to $13-14k on news hype as everyone talks about BTC hitting $10k, followed by a crash to who knows what and then slow recovery up and beyond $10k
deluded
Boy, Elon Musk has really let himself go
This thing has literally exceeded all my expectations
