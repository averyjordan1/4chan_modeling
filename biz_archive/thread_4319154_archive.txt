What a great day it was today.
Anyone else here not really bothered by the drama today?
I love coming to /biz/ to see all the pink Wojaks and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAposting and today was a day like no other.
Thanks, /biz/.
Remember to always buy high and sell low.
I am pretty new to Crypto, I had no idea /biz/ was such a fun board.
thisI enjoy other losses more than my wins
Deleted my blockfolio a few weeks ago.
My main priority is finding a job atm, no idea whats going on.
Same.I check coinmarketcap on my break at work.
When I see husge falls, I automatically think "I can't wait to get home and get on biz to see the carnage"
Remember, you're here forever
why does seeing others get rekt and posting here make me laugh?
Am i a sociopath?
Because /biz/ is mostly a bunch of fucking retards who have no idea what they're doing and it's fucking hilarious to see when it all goes nuclear and /biz/ collectively loses its mind.
>broke even todaycontainment boards best boards
*high five*
