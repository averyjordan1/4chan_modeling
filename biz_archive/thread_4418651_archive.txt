>$1 before sibos>$5 after post-sibos news>$10 by november>$50 eoydeluded linkies.
nice to see youre lowering expectations though
4418755i consider right now eoy roughly, still possible we get $1 / coin tho

Swift alone is trading 12trillion worth of dollars in transactions between their network of banks every single day.take 0.001% of that and you still have a ridiculous evaluation of the price of link.Bare in mind this is just ONE use case for link and ONE partner that we know of.
To say that the technology link brings is worth cents is pretty fucking stupid dude, no matter how annoying the linkies are.
stop it deluded linkies, its getting sad
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
That's NEO.
LINK is $5 EOY.
sometimes i cant help but feel that i might actually be deludedlike im some insane child in throes and psychosis about some imaginary coin while other onlook with pity and remorse that i was ever let born so as to save me from my horrible lifei feel like im on the outs of an inside joke, like im a mental patient looking out from the asylum, wondering how i got here and why people keep looking at me as if theres something wrongdeep down, i do know theres something wrongand its that people arent buying more link
In 2018!
wow thanks for the Insight I WILL SELL ALL MY LINK untill 2018 then rebuy it cheaper, you are so smart poster!
All this bullying will just make the rewards that much sweeter.
Why aren't you selling and then buying back in at the start of december?No news will happen til then
Damn the Linktards are going full retard.
Be sure to have your wojacks ready when reality hits you in the face.
i keep a third of my money there just in case.
just wish that third wasnt bought at 38 cents
