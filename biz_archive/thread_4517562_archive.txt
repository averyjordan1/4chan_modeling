BCH mooning right now, straight past 1500 jumping to 2500.
You heard it here first.
Post here in an hour when you regret not buying.Also VTC ftw
>vertcoin>segwit>lightning networkThat coin has both of the reasons why BCH forked from BTC.
What the hell are you on?
jumping to 2500It's not going that far today.
Seriously if it's you who is always making these threads based on guesswork based on the last hour's movement of the coin, please stop.
The likelihood is that the recent increase is simply many non-mega whales and a lot of individual small timers accumulating BCH in anticipating of the BTC difficulty adjustment in 2 days.Either that or slushpool owner changed sides to BCH and is converting his BTC to BCH.
OP here again, hope you bought at my signal :).You're not wrong, there's a good chance that there will be heavy resistance, but I'm still calling that at the very least we'll see a spike there, correction, then another run up to 3500-4500 between then and the 26th.
