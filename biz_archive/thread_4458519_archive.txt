Even with Lightning Network, Bitcoin & Litecoin they wouldn't be able handle all world's transactions once fiat currency inevitably crashes.
So, a third chain (at least) is needed... me thinks FTC!
how can VTC have a 200mil+ market cap when it is just an asic resistant clone of LTC?
FTC has faster blocks, was created before Vertcoin, and has way better branding.
What the fuck does vert even mean.
Feathercoin's name make's more sense as it is lighter than litecoin.

i dare you to make these claims on Reddit
These markets can be irrational so maybe, but I doubt it
Fuck off, retard.
VTC is solid.Ever notice how these FTC dummies constantly try to pit themselves against VTC?
It's because they realize it has no merit on it's own, so they try to attack the weakest of the 3 usually compared: BTC, LTC, VTC.
VTC has had a ton of community building and support recently, and FTC doesn't so it will continue to amount to a pile of shit.
Yet you had no critiques for the fundamentals of FTC because you know they're better.
and "attack the weakest of the three"?
FTC buyers believe in the long term viability of BTC and LTC so there would be no reason to pit FTC against them
