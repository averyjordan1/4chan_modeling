What's the biz consensus on this WTC chinkscam coin?
Good for a quick flip or avoid completely?
It makes me nauseous how hard the reddit pajeets shill it but seems like it has a few releases coming that could pump
ooooo Walton i like the name & style makes me think of wall street bald man, i buy now
Fucking chink coin.
Hate holding these bags.Everyone here is saying to hold til January for the blockchain release (if they donâ€™t fucking delay it again)
its run its course, there are way too many bagholders for this to moon again in the short term, wait for the next cycle which should be in a few months
get out if you can, they're nowhere near the level of sophisticated of the team whose idea they've stolen (wabi coin)
Bought at 77000 fucking kill me
It will be end of January/early February before it even starts to move.
It will be a slow bleedout until then.
I love the project, it made my portfolio what it is today, and after I hit some moon missions I'll get back in.
But it definitely pissed some people off when they delayed the main chain release.
There's like 5 copycats now, which tells you what a good idea blockchain + logistics is
