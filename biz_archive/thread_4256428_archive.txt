>traded alts for BTC before run>cashed out BTC fairly high and put back into alts>waited for alts to rise today>sold off alts after gainsnow what?
just wait for a crash?
or did I sell alts too soon?
get your money into FIAT, get out of this market and never look back.
If stay around, sooner or later the exchanges, their bots and fake Tether money will find a way to screw you and make you lose your gains.
or did I sell alts too soon?yes.
At least the alts I'm holding are no where near selling point
