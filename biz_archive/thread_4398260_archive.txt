BTC is no longer good at what is was made for, a currency.
I can't wait until BIZ explodes when money floods out of BTC

BTC is no longer good at what is was made for, a currencyGold isn't either.
They're a store of value.I missed the BTC train because I didn't see utility.
ETH has utility but utility doesn't make something moon, speculation does.Gold has $200 worth of actual utlity and $1k worth of speculation.ETH is fundamentals, BTC is speculation.
Extreme Up and Downs are normal for BTC
ETH is a solid growth investment.
Last I checked BTC was still the ticker for Bitcoin
Like hell it will kek.

Hodlcel till 2050 while the BTC boys are partying on their yachts with Elon Musk.
Typical ETH cope
