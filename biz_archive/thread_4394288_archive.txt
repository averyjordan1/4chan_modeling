XRP has landed some huge news.
Ripple has already mooned.
The sell off and dead cat bounce have also already happened.
I personally think you'll see a steady rise throughout the day, but it's your money.

This was the case last time as well and Ripple still pushed 29 cents.
Like I say, your call.
I got in at 3300, so currently I'm okay.
I think we will slowly rise above 4000 in the next hour or two when all of America is awake.
goddessIt's dude with his cock cut off
Holy shit...This is actually huge
That's why I think it isn't just a one pump and done thing.
I really think it will steadily rise throughout the day.
I could dump it at 3550 right now after buying at 300, but I know I can make more if I slow my roll.
One last post.
A triple bottom has formed.
Look for yourselves.
Peace!
Bought some so its probly gonna dump
