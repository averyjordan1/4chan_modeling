I think it will do well long term.
Set a record for people involved in the ico, and they're willing to take lots of pressure and hate from people because they're late releasing wallets.
Anyone that serious about getting it right has a solid chance to do well.
And it's a good idea.
>THE TFW WHEN DROPPED 13 ETH ON ICO AND CANT SELL CAUSE THE TEAM IS ABSOLUTELY RETARDED!!!!!!!!!!!
paper wallet was available since day one.
They got hacked and it was address immediately.
Its ease of use is whats gonna get it rolling.
