I just bought as much BCC as possible, Laugh at me.
ahhahaha...what a dumbass ahahha...
Correction: as I can afford.
Good move m8!Bitcoin Cash is in the midst of a breakout.
Now the price moves in narrow range between 1200.00 and 1120.00 levels.
MACD lines stay at the signal level and itâ€™s an additional confirmation of range market conditions.
However, on Nov. 25th, a major portion of hash rate will be moving over to BCH.
We should be ready to see a breakout above the borders.
It will give us a new trading opportunity.
As we can make profit, we should place buy orders to break 1200.00 resistance level.
once past the 1200, the first profit targets are 1400.00 and 1600.00 levels.
Never buy bitconnectyou mean bch for sure but never buy bitconnect
