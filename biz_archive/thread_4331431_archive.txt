Can we take a moment to appreciate how wrong this anon was.He posted it a week before the August fork.Acted like he knows everything.Since August 1 the crypto market cap grew from $100 billion to $200 billion.Bitcoin grew from $3000.BitcoinCash didn't die.This proves that some of biztards are larping out of their butthole.
TL,DR
This is basically why I do the opposite of whatever tryhard pseuds says
did sam hyde post this

if you've been on here for at least 3 months, by now you should know that 90% of /biz/ is comprised of arrogant idiots, larpers, closet homosexuals who beat off to trap porn, actual cucks who need to make more money to pay for their wife's son's basketball camp tickets, etc.
etc.this board is filled with fucking idiots, shitskin """americans""", niggers, and thus the frequency of pink wojaks.
basically every thread is "huurrr durrr i'm so smart i bought this coin and if you don't you're gonna die poor"...maybe only 1 out of 100 poasts are actually accurate.
the rest is either garbage or maybe like 10-20% are funny shitposts.
i really hate /biz/ now but the comedy here is top-notch.anyone posting "predictions" are usually proven wrong very quickly.
and no, i'm not excluding myself from this criticism.
i was calling a top on BTC at $4900 last month and was proven wrong.
but at least i have the sack to admit it.
ohh yeah i vaguely remember this image posted here beforedidn't read it then and wont read it now lol
Who u callin a nigger?
I remember it, had a good laugh.
I'm not reading that bs
