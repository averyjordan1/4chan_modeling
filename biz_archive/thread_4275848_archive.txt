Can we discuss Bitcoin Cash's inflation rate and how it'll effect price and adoption in the future?I know the upcoming fork is going to tackle difficulty, but idk the effect on inflation and last I heard inflation rate was about 7-10x that of bitcoin.I like BCash and I understand the reason behind the inflation to attract miners, but this could actually be a problem down the line.
Remember this won't be the last time politics will cause consensus issues and hardforks.
the only important question is if the difficulty is going to be lowered enough for it to be more profitable to mine than bitcoin.
Inflation will be the same as bitcoin's after the November 13th hardfork.Difficultly algorithm is changing to a better one.
THIS IS IMPORTANT
