COSS added hydrominer and another ico todayThey have 3 icos launching on their website this week as wellLooks like volume is about to pick up which means price is going up.
$0.25 too high of hopes?
Literally: JUST the coin

COSSdresser checking in
NICE!
Coss will moon by end of year if payment gateways get implemented.
Will coss add IOTA?
Yes.
I know because I am in control of all COSS stuff.
What other coins you want us to add?
both have literally 0 volume so far and didn't even sell out 1/3 of their tokens during the sales

You can't run an exchange with contractors.
