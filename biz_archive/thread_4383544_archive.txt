A box that makes you a mixed drink, seals it in a container, and flies it to you via drone.
Put them in San Francisco so the price of a drone dropped drink is still less than bad drinks.

A machine that will be the same size of a microwave, but can be used to easily bake.
It will have buttons so it will be "programmable" by the user like a roomba.
It can do basic baking techniques like folding batter, whipping, , regular mixing, convection baking, even a cooling cycle.

Currently a student who is also getting a cooking diploma besides my main study.
Literally no good korean restaurant in the city (I am half korean and know the kitchen well).
Meanwhile korean embassy is expanding and more and more koreans come here while shitty koreanguest houses get filled with people.
My sollution: a korean restaurant that is also a guest house.
Guests would also be more likely to order more drinks at the restaurant due to their room being in the same building so that would be an extra cash bonus for me.
Money would be very appreciated BTC: 16my744XivWPJhj5qnE6zFurueoLyV5xd
I've designed this tool to save electricity while using IOTA.
Basically, it's a conductive testicle holster which convert the heat of each nut into the electricity needed to confirm two transactions.

I want to be a business that works directly with Amazon.If you are a prime member like me, you get a lot of Amazon boxes.Instead of recylcing them or throwing them away, what if there was a service that came to your house, picked up the boxes and broke them down and took them back to Amazon.They could directly re-use any lightly used boxes, recycle the rest and look like the good guys who are saving the environment.
thanks but no, oil is the major industrial asset in this epoch, i want to change that, i'll publish my research even when i'm dead or so far away from this shit
Cardboard is cheap af, labour and gas is not plus the logistics would be another huge expense.
how retarded are you?
You under estimate leftist virtue signalers who will pay for the very appearance doing good for the environment.

This will work i have tested this with a computer fan and a 2 liter bong.

Yuppie leftie types love this shit.
Indeed, this is the problem with a lot of these inventions, same with the LCD price tag thing.
In that yes it's a bloody good idea and makes basic sense, however is it cheaper than what already exists?
Why would the customer company bother with your awesome product if what they're ALREADY DOING is cheap as fuck?Change is expensive, it has to give some major advantage, AND save a shitload of money, rather than just be a good idea.I'm in a unique position family wise in that my partner is Bangladeshi, her mum is a retired diplomat, and her dad is a VP of a major bank there with lots of business contacts.
Labour and resources are CHEAP AS FUCK there.
If Brexit happens, trade should be good too.
HOWEVER, I'm a problem solver, my partner is a researcher.
We lack VISION and IDEAS as well as the ability to be a convincing salesperson.
There has to be something we could do..
Also with this you're just asking to be directly undercut by Amazon.
If this was worth doing, they'd just have their own delivery drivers pick up the boxes and hand them back the next time they pick up a parcel.
invest in LARP stocks they give good dividends
Back when the world was fun, Soldier of Fortune Magazine had a classifieds section where everything from espionage specialists and security personnel to mercenaries and assassins could be found, contacted, and hired.
I intend to develop a similar service on the internet taking advantage of the fact that cryptocurrencies allow for people to circumvent international laws and action from established financial services, such as the freezing of assets by banks.
This also eliminates the need to use shady services such as the cayman islands and swiss banks which would be very appealing to newcomers in the industry.
