Hey guys lets talk about which coins have the best designed icons, I'll start, clearly number one.
JUST/thread
I pick Digibyte

AST.I also like ETC and ADA.
ADA is good, but it has something that just doesn't feel top notch, ETC is pretty good too, probably better than ETH.
AST is shit though

Eboost
kek I would buy a coin if the official design was that
Viacoin and NEM
On second thought, I pick /biz coin
Bitbean has best icon
ETH and NEO are aesthetic as fuck
Qtum
Anyone buy segwit2x futures on bitfinex?
That's gotta feel so shitty right about now.
Especially for those that are just waking up now and didn't even have a chance.
NEM.honorable mentions:>ETH>XRP>SALT>GNT>STRAT
 DELEET DIS
it's an absolute shitcoin but you have to respect its logo.
almost tricked me into buying some a couple months ago
Neo is so fucking amateur it makes me cringe.
on a whim i looked this up a month or two ago to see what happened and it was an actual, legitimate scam.
this coin had a few days of shilling here too lol
The only thing that made me dubious about this coin is this shitty logo
