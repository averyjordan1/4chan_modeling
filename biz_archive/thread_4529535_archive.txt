What did they mean by this?
Tether =/ USD
wtf i sold bitcoin now
Tether ain't money, basically.Enjoy those numbers you see on the screen.
Might as well be monopoly money until you actually have real cash in your hands.
"You and we agree"If this was drafted by a lawyer then it was by Lionel Hutz.
Proper legalese would say "The parties" or "The signatories".
"You and we".
WTF, lol.
No fuckin shit, you think you can just pull out wads of cash from your cd drive because you have tether?
It is indeed no fucking shit, yet people still believe their USDT is USD and trade as such.
Who knows how many people even tested whether their coins are withdrawal-able.
They want to avoid any legal difficulties in the shittiest way possible
