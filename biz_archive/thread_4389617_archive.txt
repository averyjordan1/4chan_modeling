Can someone less retarded than me clarify this shit:>want to move from ausland to america>put all savings into buttcoin and close bank account>go to america>open bank account>deposit all bitcoin into bank account>classifies as capital gains>get taxed 50% of my savingsIs this how shit works?
Are bitcoins automatically assumed to be an investment?
short term capital gains is like 35% and long term is like 15%idk the specifics on being a foreigner and coming in with money, i would assume you dont get taxed on money you made before becoming a US citizen
reality vs expectationsdoesnt work that way, have you tried opening a bank account in another country?
No you don't pay capital gains on 100% of your money, only on the amount GAINED on your initial investment.So if by the time you get to america BTC is worth 10% more, you have to pay 35% of 10% of your investment.
If BTC is worth the same or less, you don't owe anything.
