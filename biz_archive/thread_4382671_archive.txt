just went all in; only coin that's going up during this FUD fest
Pump and dump running on hype atm cause ppl want in to current short term gold like powr, rdn, arn etc.
Will break ath and continue to moon shortly forward.
Alright fomo for the coming 15 days.
Atleast im keeping it real anon
People currently want irl use investments with the latest shit, cloud storage on the blockchain got some hype and is a good investment currently.
Also binance turning to btrx 2.0 is relevant and publishing the latest shitcoins sure helps and makes the hype unreal and unlogical.
Still good investment
