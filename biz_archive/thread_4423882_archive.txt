BITCOIN CASH IS CRASHING HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
holding comfy at $1200 even with BTC testing all time highs, super bullish sign.
corecoin will be slain by next week
just sold all my cash
fucking piece of shit - so many better alts can't wait for the sheeple to catch up
corecoin will be slain by next weekAnd then the market fucking crashes.
Great job Jihan
You know that dip everyone keeps telling you about?
This was it.
I think it's waaaay to fucking risky unless you got some whale friends on discord telling you what to do.
I will stay outside of this.
And then the market fucking crasheswhy do you newfags keep implying this is a bad thing?
a few months ago /biz/ loved the idea of a market crash, then we can all buy low and have more time to accumulate
No the dip was 0.0105.
Getting out with 70% increase in BTC in one day is great
I'm actually a cashie...I was trading shit and I thought I could profit, I sold .5 bitcoin cash and now I want it back... so I tried to get people to sell theirs,FUCKI think I'm gonna be left behind now bag holding BTCdamn itplease drop the price againpleaseif anything I'm gonna exchange for some other altcoin if I don't recover this by tomorrow morning.I already put a limit order of what I sold my BCH for, hoping to reach that target againT_TThis is how it feels to be justedEvery time I trade I fucking loseWould be happy to get my .5 BCH backvery happy
44239154423936442395044239714423983so this.. is the power.. of shilling..woah
I SAID CRASH AGAIN DAMN ITTTTTTTTTTI'm gonna go outside and then come home go to sleepI HOPE MY ORDER GETS FILLED AND I GET MY .5 BCH BACKGIVE IT BACKIT'S FUCKING MINE
just buy back and hold, it's starting to get seriously dangerous to be holding any corecoin as their difficulty adjustment looms.
that's when the miners will all switch to BCH for good and freeze the BTC chain
I'll sell you it for 4ETH
When it hits 1500 it will drop to 1350 unless fomo has kicked in

Bitcoin Core whales step up your game.I thought you said Bitcoin Cash was trash, it is now time to dump it.Just dump the Trash coin, take it to the trash can, and dump it in exchange for some winner coins like BTCBTC is a winner coin guys, it is the number one coin in the world, not decentralized at all or anything.So yeah...Definitely worth it to sell Bitcoin Cash for bitcoins guysI'm telling youThis is itjust dump your cash because it is a shit coin no one wantsno one fucking wants it, I mean rank 3 is just a flukeIt will get surpassed in a few months just wait, BCH will be rank 100 because BTC will moon due to CME futures and the lightning networkSo grab your BCH, take it to the nearest exchange, and dumpppppI'm telling you, BCH is trash :)Anyway if BCH doesn't crash tonight, I'm just going to be buying some fucking altcoin tomorrow damn it.
