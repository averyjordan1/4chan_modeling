>My portfolio?
You see my good sir, I invest 60% in Bitcoin, 30% in Ethereum, and 10% in Litecoin.
>Bittrex?
I donâ€™t know of that crypto currency.
Is it on CoinBase?
you are right to only put 40% into alts.
Diversification is key.
Friendly reminder that normies that just bought a decent amount of BTC onliterally a year ago and hodl it, have made more gains than 90% of you traderkeks.
>HODL
Still beating /biz/'s investment choices.
Let that sink in.
how do they gain btc if they're just hodling it?
He didn't say they gained BTC
Just wait until LINK is $50 and I'll be sure to give you a ride in my lambo
The mocking doesn't even make sense anymore.
Still doing better than most of us on biz kek.

You're trying to make fun of someone with a portfolio like that, but over the past couple months they would likely be up more than you playing in the shit with your memecoins.
