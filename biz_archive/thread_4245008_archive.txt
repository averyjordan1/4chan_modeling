I'll see you guys at 20000 satsGood bye for now
If it ever falls to 20k I'm maxing out my credit card and taking a loan.

Most of thay decline is due to the rise of BTC, not the fall of ARK.
ARK will go on a fucking moon mission after the fork.
Segwit2x fork the 18th?
I've set a buy order at 29k.
I wanna get in before the fork
Bitcoin is going to moon like fuck after the fork as there's no more uncertainty about the segshit2x shit.
Easy 10k on the day of the fork.
