Interested how much btc/gram was it?
This kind of mindset is starting to piss me ofIts like those fiat pre-inflation fags screeching how cheap stuff wereStfu already leave the past in the past
You didn't replace the BTC after you purchased?!!
Just think if you didn't buy weed with bitcoin back then we might not even be discussing bitcoin right now.
historical costs
Tbh senpai purchasing anything with bitcoin would be silly rn
This is why I don't do drugs.
It fucks up your brain.
Good, that's what you get for doing drugs.
You are an idiot.
Bitcoin is a currency.
You buy things with it.
Now shut up.
>KMSYes when bitcoin spiked to $1,000 and subsequently crashed to $200 for YEARS, you would have seriously held during that.
Sure.
I believe you about as much as I can throw you.
i hope it was some dankass bud OP
If weedfags like you hadn't bought it and used it as currency it would never have made anyone any money so thank you OP for being a weedfag.
literally me buy 1.1 btc for 400+ bucks>to buy shit on darknet>spend 0.7 btc for BS mostly>still have 0.4 btc and making more money than I ever hadI could have so much more but I was stupid enough to pay about 200$ for viagra, 500 for weed, 700 for random medssunglasses for 2k FMLwhatever I still got around 3k so it's fine
How did you have the balls to give them your address?
viagra>weedIf you didn't get the weed, you wouldn't have needed the viagra...
