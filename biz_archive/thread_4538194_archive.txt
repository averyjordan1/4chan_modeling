Are they gonna do the thing where they spam transactions and force like 200k+ uncomfirmed transactions again later today?
Can't do that so easily now because BCH difficulty would go up very quickly, thus making it less profitable.Last time BTC had very little hashrate for a long time, which is just not going to happen
