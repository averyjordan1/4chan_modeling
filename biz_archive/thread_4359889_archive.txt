My first tradesIve had some experience with trading through the Neopets Stock Exchange so I know about the basics (not FOMO, not buying ATH, buy low, sell high)And these are my first few trrades with $50 bucks just to test and experiment.
How did I do?Whats a good stop loss ratio?I'm doing 2% and taking profits at 1-10%
