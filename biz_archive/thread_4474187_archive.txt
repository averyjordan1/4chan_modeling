So my recently deceased dad bought half a bitcoin a while back for like 20 bucks, and my mom says she has all the info for his bitcoin wallet.
So how do I turn that bitcoin into cash, and should i take it all out and invest it, or simply leave it to increase in value?
Leave it...sorry to hear about your pops.
A couple years from now and you won't believe where the dollar sign will be.
Verify you have the correct info and & access to it, then save it and forget it.
