Has BTC and BCH broken their inverse correlation?
BCH pump not taking BTC down
zero sum game desu senpai
It's too early to call such things.What may be happening is that bitcoin bulls are deliberately fighting against downward pressure.
(Look at the volume that is currently spiking on btc/usd charts)Or, perhaps this is just a pump to bring bcc closer towards a greater long-term goal of parity with btc.On a sidenote: It's important to not just focus on price correlations in crypto (as quantitative finance tends to do).
The fundamental aspects of mining profitability must also be focused on, when comparing btc's price to bcc's price.
Yeah that has been happening
(I focus on crypto trading pairs with usd because my overall concerns are with mining profitability)
Total crypto marketcap has been steadily rising the last weeks.
I think a lot of money is coming in from the outside.
If I were to guess, BTC value is bleeding into BCH but it's not that visible on the price because USD value is feeding BTC value.
