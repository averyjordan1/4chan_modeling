If you want to transfer a large sum of BTC, is it better to divide it up into smaller parts in case something goes wrong?
nope, just do 1 small transaction first if you wana be cautious
Divide your transaction into 100 pieces so you lose half of it due to fees.
if its in an exchange trade it for ltc before transferring it
when I was new I used to do one small and then one big trans.
Today just one big dong.
