 years old>NEET>$12,000 liquid cash in bank>estimated $20,000 coming in next few monthsI have 2 ventures right now and that's it.
Both are not even profitable yet.
Don't shill ICO's without a forecast and give me some ideas other than shitcoins.

Also my rent is paid 3 months in advance if that helps.
Bitcoin.
All in.
ETHOSOMG Walk away for a year and thank me when you come back.
