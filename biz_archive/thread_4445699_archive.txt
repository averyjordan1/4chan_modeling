Was thinking about getting into crypto rollercoaster but I don't think it's worth spending money for shit.
I understand the need for bitcoin and how it all started.
But all other shitoins today are only created so faggs can play stock market, no real value, no real pratical use as an alternative currency.
If noone is using shitcoins other than buy and sell.. it won't work.
get over it, you missed the real deal 8 years ago, go and find a job faggots
