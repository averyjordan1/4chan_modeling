>BCH continues to moon>BTC recovery imminent Feels /comfy/ ladsAm I gonna make it or should I start shopping for rope?
Maybe looking to dump the BTC into ETH or Monero
Will the Asians keep pumping if I go to bed?
Should I get up in the middle of the night to make sure?
not gonna lie to yah lad, I think BTC is actually in trouble RN
You gotta do something my dudeThey'll keep pumping so long as BCH is so easy to mine, or until 2PM tomorrow.
BCH is now past ETH in terms of market cap.
It's not gonna stop.
Do something as in do what?
Ditch BTC?
was talking to OPbut yeah, he should really drop BTC for something more stable, ETH, LTC, or XMR are the best bets.-15% on your lion's share is unacceptable
I'm 35% BTC and 35% BCC, am I gonna make it bros?
I am op check my IDI think I'm leveraged well, even if one goes up by x amount and the other goes down by x amount the % change of BCC is much greater
Pretty sure it is, I can see BTC actually being replaced by BCH with this massive FOMO, huge transaction log and huge profitability.
Transaction backlog gonna change soon when btc becomes 3x more profitable
