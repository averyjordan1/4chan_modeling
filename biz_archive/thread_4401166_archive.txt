Emperor Sunny Rides to BattleShitcoins...I hate Shitcoins.
My grandfather hated them too, even before they put out his eyes.
Did you think I'd be out here on reddit without good reason?
Yes, VeChain needs a strong frontier.
No, VeChain doesn't need unwashed shitcoins at her gates!
So, that's why I'm here, the leader of the VENturions: to bring VENturion order to stinking shitcoins.Revenge?
That'd be good too.
This war against the shitcoins won't last long, and when it's done, I've got plans.We VENturions are the only true China coin.
We saved Chinese Crypto, we drove out the FUDders, we made the Foundation.
The Foundation deserves respect; respect, and obedience.
We know what is best for Crypto: new exchanges, partnerships, working product, tags!
I know what must be done.This is all about power, power in VeChain.
After all, the man who controls crypto rules the world...and one day, Sunny Lu will be Emperor.
VeChain Invicta!!!
Love the meme, but all jokes aside - look at those partners!
4401255Dubs aside, what is the difference between this, NEO or WTC?
They all claim (((partnerships))) or are in (((advanced talks))).
Is there a roadmap to when shit will actually get done?
obvious shill is obvious pretty sneaky VEN
There's working projects in the wild, no {{advanced talks}} but they have their tags on stuff and in stuff already
shillI wish, I'm not even being paid..
Think Supply Chain dude
I have seen the wine video and that is what hooked me in.
It's practicable and has usage, especially with the 'muh china' meme of their increasing need for wine.
Haha, this is awesome.
I'm excited about VeChain.
Thanks for sharing!
How do I get a job as a shill?
Can you tell your master?
it does get annoying but the links do look pretty tasty.i've been pumped about ven for a while though.
it's a solid project
