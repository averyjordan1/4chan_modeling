I'm new here.
Just recently found out about crypto and trying to learn everything I can.
I've just bought $500 worth of BTC, 1 Ethereum and 1 Litecoin.
How am I doing so far?
And I have a few hundred dollars more to play around with, should I throw that into altcoins or increase my other investments?
keep buying bitcoin until you have a full one.
very rarely does anything consistently outpace bitcoin gains.
I would stick with those ratios.
Don't buy low-market-cap alts.
It's not investing, it's not even speculating, it's just gambling.
>hell for the crypto memejust buy high sell low
This image is pretty accurate desu (minus chainlink) it's like the /biz/ trader life cycle.
What said is gonna be good advice unless you really want to jump down this rabbitholeWhen you buy altcoins it's because you think it will do better than bitcoin, there's very few alts that have done that over timeOnly hold 3-5 positions at any one time, it's tempting to have a little in everything but that just minimizes your gains, pick 3-5 that you really really believe in and stick to thoseI'd look at the top 25 on coinmarketcap and pick 3-5 from those if you're considering alts, but what you're in right now is just fine if you don't want to put too much thinking and energy into crypto and still make easy gains

OP here.

I bought some bitcoin a few weeks ago.How do you go about buying alts?
Is it all done with BTC value on exchanges?
Do you keep it on exchanges or is there other wallets I can get?Asking questions like these how long until I lose everything?
What do you think about HST?
Can it hit $1 by EOY?
