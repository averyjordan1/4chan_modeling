Anyone else trading the BCH/BTC roller coaster right now?
Yup, no sleep for me tonight
I haven't caught on to the pattern tey - but i'm stupid
I'm just dumping my BTC for BCH and then HODL.
Yep but I'm wondering when BCH is going to moon... Been waiting for like an hour.
Annoying
this, I have my position and its well in the green, I'm not gonna wojack myself now by trading to swing trade this shit
Hope you aren't sleeping then because if BTC starts making upwards momentum again then BCH will bleed out.
Have fun watching charts all night
yes...
I was hoping it was just methis is the first time Im buying an Alt in months
Waiting for next departure
I managed to sell my BCH at 0.17128, waiting for the next dip to buy in again.Anyone still holding?
What's cooking on the BCH front?Up?
Down?
Stable for a while?
Looks like up, maybe wait for confirmation once it breaks 1300
Reasonable resistance @ 1300-1330 but incredibly strong support by some whales at 1250.
So quite low risk at moment.
I'd say some slow intermittent growth to 1400, whether or not it meets very strong resistance 1400-1500 unforeseeable.
I'm seeing a 20 minute rise/fall pattern.Anyone else see this?
Yup I'm holding for life
That would be fucking great, then I can just buy back into BCH againProbably my favorite coin to hold
holding 60 I see no reason to sell I don't need the money right now
it's impossible for BCH to bleed past the 10k buywall Roger and the miners set up at .1, feels comfy
Sorry to tell you but that thing got pulled last night as BCH approached 0.1
The wall has consistently gone up and down, up and down.
If his wall didn't buy the BCH, I would have bought the BCH.
Please send my Bitcoin.
I am a hungry lad and your kindness will be remembered.
