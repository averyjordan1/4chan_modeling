who else here got some CAT ?so excited to see the beta, they are in talks with binance too
If you give me definitive proof that they will be listed on Binance, I will buy $10k right now.
they said they are in talks.
also with upcoming beta and the community voting they almost won, there is a high chance it happens soon
I've got CAT, though really I just bought it because I remember it was shilled on BIZ and had good fundamentals and it seemed cheap at the time.
600 at 60 cents.
only down 13%
JUSTrofl this brings me back.
the brendan fraser shitposter never came back once it went under ico price
the same shit happened with flikit means fuck all
Holding a nice stack.
This concept is the future so I'm ultra long on catThey are going through the necessary compliance right now.
It's to their credit that they do everything rigidly and properly.
Cat will not let us down in the long haul
The dumbest fucking token in existence.
There is not a single person that requires or will ever need or pay for the services blockcat provide.
What a fucking meme.
