Can someone redpill me on bitconnectJust starting up in crypto, so late to the game i know, trying to build up a reasonable portfolio.I'm just weighing up my options, bitconnect or usi-tech.
Its a ponzi scheme.
Stay away
I'm in bitconnect at the moment, it's great.It's a ponzi, don't be fooled, but that's not a bad thing in this case.
As long as you can get in and out with your profits, and don't get too greedy, it's easy money.
Don't you have to wait a year to get out?
Ponzi, but as long as btc goes up, you get monies
How hard is it to get out though?
Do they put restrictions on you or what?
Can't withdraw your initial investment for a fixed period.
The minimum investment is $100 to $1000, which locks your money away for something like 260 days.
The more money you put in, the quicker you can withdraw it again.
Here.Bitconnect is quite literally the definition of a HYIP, which is a type of ponzi
But you can get the interest out daily or whatever right?
Yep.
But until that interest goes above your initial investment, they're basically just drip-feeding your own money back to you
