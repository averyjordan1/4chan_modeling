Hi Nick
yeah, exposed for saying you should be looking to buy omg at a lower price instead of ATH like /biz/
i dont see anything weird here?dafuq?Nick is a good guy but he is a little naive to the amount of PnD and shaddy shit that goes on in the market.
I live in Palo Alto, the cradle of medical marijuana!
But truthfully,my poison of choice is coke, watch my videos and you'll see all my little coke-head tics appearing> Previous resistances are future supports> OMG is overextended guys> Do the opposite of hat /biz/ saysyou're welcome...
