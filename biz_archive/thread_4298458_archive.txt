I'm a nocoinz that will be verified at an exchange for the first time in the next 24 hours.
I was all excited to dive into coin trading but now I'm having doubts.
Is this the worst time to get into coins?
Is this the worst time to get into coins?Heh.. of course not...
Not the worst, but certainly a confusing time.I'd still put money into BTC, don't bother with BCH anymore, if this was 27 hours ago you should have bought some but now you're probably just going to be buying bags.Other than BTC idk honestly, ETH maybe.
Yes I was consider ETH as a safer alternative.
I have concerns about potential SEC crackdown on it though.
What is a bag?
I love how the BCH chart makes you wrong right now.

I haven't slept in 1.5 years
Funnily this is what happened when I first got into crypto, was a great learning experience.ETH should be fine atm but kinda stagnant, don't expect a huge price increase any time soon.I bought in @0.102 and sold @0.161, I have my profits, idc anymore.
The big gains are done, you're lucky to get 8% atm.
TOP KEK :D
This is the best time.
Chaos is a ladder.
I hope btc crashes so alts crash and i buy cheap.Go for eth while waiting.
