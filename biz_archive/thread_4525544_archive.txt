>they made fun of my TA yesterdayeat shit anons
can you atleast tell me what coin this is.
I didn't I saw that myself and went all in, feelsgoodman
TAone of the fastest ways to make sure everybody knows you have no education in IT or finance whatsoever>implying you are not trolling
Your TA literally means nothing.
It was consolidating...
I hope you are trolling
Kinda funny how you couldnt have even drawn the bottom trendline until right before the end of the triangle1st of all, thats not how you draw triangles OP2nd of all, TA only works when there's HIGH RELATIVE VOLUME in TRENDING MARKETS.
Not that stagnating crap
50% chance that it went to shit though, your analysis is pointless.
imo you couldve drawn a descending triangle there
