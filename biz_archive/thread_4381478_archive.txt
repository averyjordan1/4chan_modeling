MAINSTREAMSMARTCONTRACTSSmart contracts are more secure and cost less than current alternatives.
They will in future be used (whether it's Ethereum and LINK, who knows) to enforce futures contracts, derivatives, and all sorts of financial stuff - the kinds of markets measured in the QUADRILLIONS.Obviously we're quite far from the time when smart contracts are industry standard for derivatives and financial shit.
But this is where the market is goingBanks, investment firms, etc.
(like SWIFT) will start by testing out smart contracts in small areas of their business and as trust grows they'll look to implement them in more and more areas due to the security and cost benefits.I thought the crypto bubble had got too hot around summer time but if LINK (or some other middleware) can bridge the gap between the walled garden of smart contracts and real world data then this really is just the beginningpic related
