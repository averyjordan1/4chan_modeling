Thanks, any recommendations on which alts to buy?
not having a hardware walletlmaoing@urlife
bought some ETH @ 7$ then went to STRAT then ANTSHARES (NEO) and bounced around a few different altcoins.
Now the majority of crypto is in BTC but the BCH last night scared me
JUST
isn't stratis proof of stake?are you just pissing away free money, OP ?
They're releasing the alpha for the breeze wallet soon, going to sell @ 6-7$ when that happens :)
OP, why didn't you just put all of the 34 BTC into NEO, to generate some sweet GAS?
You are going to get absolutely fucking JUST'd by BAT, FunFair and 1stbloodThat being said, impressive bags regardless
Dump 1ST for ENJ, BAT for HST and you're good.
