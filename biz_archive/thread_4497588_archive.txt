I refuse to believe that half the people on /biz/ crashed and burned over potcoin
did someone break this contract or something?it's burning nearly everything in tx fees now, check the last few pages of transactions.
i think someone was trying to fuck with it and broke it
omg thanks for the minerium!I save some for the rest of ya

AHHHHH
Lmao only reason i didn't fall for it was because it wasn't on binance that was a good ruse to whoever shopped it
don't use eth>don't know what gas is>don't know how this scam worksCan anyone give me a quick rundown?
power of contracts,
ElaborateIt looks like this wallet is set up to bounce every incoming tx out to a different address.
Is he stealing the gas used for the tx fee?
Yes, tokens can't be transferred and the eth sent for gas, which is always more for tokens, is quickly moved.
How did you lose 100 BTC on POT?
You must have bought in after it already 4x'd, like a fucking retard.
If you get a pump signal and you look and see the price has already doubled since 3 minutes ago, you're late to the party dumbass.
Stay out.
My rule for baby pumps (like the discord groups) is to not buy in if it's gone higher than 2%, and aim for 5% take profits.
For big pumps (like Teeka-tier scams), it's 20% and 30%, respectively.Pumps are a scheme to transfer money from the late and greedy to the early and modest.
Get in early and get out early.
JUST
Do it faggot
