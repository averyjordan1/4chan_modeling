This shit is up for at least 3 days (that's when I accidentally noticed it)...I've been checking it out every now and then couple of times thru the day and most of the time, the wall is up.There were few hours yesterday when the wall was lowered but, in general, it's safe to say this shit is up all the time.
Now, my question is, what makes someone put up a 300-400 BTC buy wall and leave it up for couple of days in the most blatant manner?
What's happening with SALT?Please, don't post pics of that "$25" screenshot - nobody cares.
I want a serious discussions, pajeets fuck off.
pretty simple desu senpaisomeone with deep pockets doesn't want salt to go to 0
So he's buying them all up?
The price is kinda going sideways...what's he gonna do with all that SALT?
Fuckign trump with his walls and small loans
he's memeing you man.It's a textbook fake wall.
Notice how it moved a few thousand satoshi forward?
Normies assume that they will have strong support if they get in now.
I actually got in with stop-loss at 38.
Might also be another trick from the devs to inflate the price to $25 and dump it on us.
mmm maybe I should dump my 500k salt on the wall, he'll be happy to buy that it seems
It is SALT Lending themselves, doing the buyback like they promised at- https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/6pa601/log_of_ama_with_saltlending_caleb_salt_caleb/No whale would buy like this, it is just SALT Lending, because they have the kind of money to do this.
It means they know that SALT will be worth way more than $3 soon so they might as well just buy it themselves.
It's not a whale playing games, because it doesn't move if it gets sold into.
Also they are slowly moving up the wall.
A few days ago it was .00038 and now it is .00039.
I'm trying to buy as much as I can right now as well.
