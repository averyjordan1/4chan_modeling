I'm kinda late to the cryptoworld, but I decided that since I use a computer once a day it is worth my attention at least once a day as well.I invested in Genesis Mining instead of Bitconnect because they are more transparent and aren't a ponzi scheme.
I got lured twice in ponzi schemes before once with 0.01BTC sent in my primitive crypto days (it was advertised on freebitco.in) and the second time someone on here made me invest 0.005 BTC in Bitpetite.
I felt like it was a scam because of the way their customer service chat was done.
Anyways, now I mostly play dice on freebitco.in and collect from 5 different faucets (doge, lite, and btc) and invest in Genesis Mining.
My goal is to get a daily income that I'm going to cash out every single day to turn crypto into cash to spend.
It's going to take me time given I've only invest $350 of my own money ($100 in ETN and $150 in Genesis Mining, $100 in freebitco.in) I lost $70 on freebitco.in because I got greedy but I have recovered from losses on that website before so it's only a matter of time before I recover.
My short term goal is to re-invest every single BTC earned into Genesis mining until my hashpower becomes significant enough.

nice blogpost faggot when you turn 18 you can link your bank account to coinbase and actually buy it
If you're backing Genesis Mining, you should be backing HIVE Blockchain Technologies too.
They are a subsidiary of Genesis(CA Ticker: HIVE; US Ticker: PRELF)
I already have a credit card on coinbase I just don't want to invest real money into it.
I wanna get what is free and use it to invest online.
Next batch of Gen mining contracts was canceled this morning on the telegram
It was announced via telegram this AM the contracts have been forestalled...
