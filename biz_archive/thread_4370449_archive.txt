Alts are green, which means if you're making gains, remember to sell high.
Don't get greedy.
Bitcoin will pump again and you sure want to bring your gains to btc before we get pink wojacks again.
what if your alts aren't green because you've been hodling this entire BTC fork fuckfest?
Good advice, but as always, DYOR everybody
Then you've made poor risk management decisions.
Create a well balanced portfolio so you win both when btc is green and when alts are green.
Good fucking advice.
I sold some BCH at .25 and some XMR at .018.
Both wins.As usual, only wish I had traded with a lot more of both.
I generally trust my decision-making but hedge my bets by trying not to overreach, you know?
