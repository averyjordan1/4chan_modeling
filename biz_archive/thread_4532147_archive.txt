At least Confido victims can still sell their coins for 1% of their previous value.
For those that don't know, the Coingather exchange went offline 36 hours ago with no warning and has no official response from the exchange for the reason why.
I had a few ETH worth of buy/sell orders on there that is completely gone.
Let this be a reminder to all you anons out there to never keep coins you can't afford to lose somewhere you don't control the private keys.
coingatherliterally who the fuck would use some kind of new exchange instead of binance/bittrexof course it's a scam
they gathered your coins

Damn that sucks.
I trade mostly on a different smallish exchange (a couple million daily volume) and now I'm a bit paranoid that they'll do the same thing eventually.
