Hi /biz/,I live in Estonia and would like to take out a loan for about 10 000€.
What are the best places for finding loans online for someone like me?
Doesn't sound like a good idea, coming from a fellow estonian...
Not wise
You should ask yourself.
Whatfore do I need it, is it sustainable and how am I going to pay it back if it fails.Or do you want to loand and run?
:p
go ask some slav in narva for it
Get fuckd
>dude from the land of peer-to-peer lending websites asks where he can take out a loangud joke
lmao why pay back?
just kys if it fails
All the aspects of "money handling" and the math of paying back even if i lose jt all in an instant is done and won't be a problem.
The money itself is for investing in cryptos.
I have done my homework on that part too.
Just need a bigger pot of gold to double.
Investing 100€ a month just isn't enough for me.
Were there only 1 website I wouldnt of asked.Makes sense, no?
