ALL ABOARD THE BANCOR MOON SHUTTLE
Is Bancor a stable Coin?
Its always around 2$
Is there news?
I'm holding on until their platform is unleashed.super stable.
Annoyingly stable.

Nobody wants this shitcoin.
The market has already proven it.
prep the pink wojaks
Makes sense.
It's not exactly market friendly.
it's holding between 1.8 and 2.20 I'm not sure if bancor should be against BTC.
It might be like Ripple where it makes more sense to think about it in dollars and also ETH until they kick off.
