I'm reading this as >we failed to position Segwit2x as defacto bitcoin and rather it was understood as new alt so we're going to try again later
OPEN LONG POSITION ON BTC RIGHT NOWRIGHT FUCKING NOW
this is fucking bullshitbitcoin was supposed to kill itselfFUCK THIS STUPID BULLSHIT
Why do they think there will ever be a later?Its over for BTC forks.
HAHAHAH I SOLD ALL MY BAGS AT THE LAST SECOND.Thank fuck i was infront a pc.

im not paying 7600 for a single fucking bitcoinget the fuck out of herewhens the god damn crash
>pussied out and didnt sell at 7850 :(
NOW IT TANKS AGAIN I BOUGHT ALL BTC AT PEAK WHAT

That's right, you'll be paying 8000 soon
$10K EOY, its over, no coiners and alt coiners will literally kill themselves overnight.open long position right now btc bros
Literally bought 100usd worth of Bitcoin to buy DGB with like fucking 8 hours ago and now this shit happens.
Fucking half of me wants to just hodl, and another part wants to sell back my DGB for fucking 10 SATs less then I bought them for.
kekSHITCOINERS TOTALLY BTFO
xDDDDDDDDDDD
This means bitcoin is going to come crashing down really fucking hard.People only bought because of the fork.Where do I short at a massive leverage?
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTT
I vowed to just hodl BTC after getting JUSTed too many times, now I reap the benefits
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUU(UUUUCK
It will?
why?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DURIPYlsx5s
He's just hoping some dumbass will buy his bags.
People literally only bought BCH because they thought the fork would hurt BTC but now there is no fork and nothing standing in the way of BTC so BCH will go back to being the shitcoin that it is
>spiked up to 50kwew lad
IS IT GOING TO GO ANY FURTHER OR IS IT GOING TO DROP BACK DOWN SOMEONE TELL ME PLS
just bought more btc but that doesnt mean altcoins will shit the bed lol
ALT BULL MARKET RETURNS TONIGHTALT BULL MARKET RETURNS TONIGHT
8k todayktoday
4249856No competition for bitcoin cash now - Segwit2x was supposed to be big blockers + segwit cancer.
With segwit2x dead now its only the shitcoin segwit1x and that will kill itself with low fees.VERY FUCKING BULLISH FOR BITCOIN CASH
anyone elses blockfolio isnt refreshing ?
>if I had held btc I would have quadrupled my money>instead I traded and am down 20%
BTC will kill itself with high fees and low transaction throughput*
LISK IS SUPPOSED TO BE DROPPING LIKE VERYTHING ELSE NOT PUMPING I JUST SOLD
BUY NOW
I JUST NEED THE ALTS TO STAY LOW TILL FRIDAY SO I CAN RECEIVE MY BTC AND ACCUMULATE MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!111!!!!!1!!!
!1000!0!0!4
Literally false
yes, think long term
they won't be a later, all they have to play with is bcash nowthis was their only chance, it's obvious now that any second attempt will be met with even more resistance, because they know they can call their bluff againand the longer they wait real scaling will start being used, second layer wallets, etc, will make any block size increase look like a joke in the next 12/18 months
You know we are joking when we say buy high sell low, right?
tfw all alts are pumping
people literally only pumped BCH because of the fork FUD, now it's worthless

Btc dump
Enjoy your (((Segwit))) and fees.Literally not Satoshi's vision.
you must read the bible too and think gods vision isnt happening
I bought 2400 dgb early summer and lost $200+ on it... its a trashcoin, dump now.
No, this is actually it.
The mother of all dips to buy.
With Segwit2X out of the picture, the only commercially usable Bitcoin is BCH.
Once realised, it will steadily moon.
this
SCREENCAP ME TOO PLS
and i bet you think bcash is?
even though it violates the most important principle of proof of work?
Guys what the fuckk is happening???
What will the market do with the newss??
Why are alts going up???
I'm betting you're wrong and BX1 is going to collapse under it's own wait.
I always think people are full of shit when they say this, but I really hope BCH dips hard af.
For cheap coins.
is bitcoin going to go any HIGHER????
why wouldnt the alts go up?
they were down because people sold them to get 2x, well since they wont ALTIES WILL RISE AGAIN
4250165BCH is not a bitcoin, it's an alt like hundreds of others, there is no reason that in case of btc death people would go for bch instead of ARK or whatever else
Alts will go up, and bitcoin could go down or up, we don't know yet
OR IS IT GOING TO CRASH
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAFaggots who sold with rubber hands and shitted their pants with thah Wall St FUDTold yall toH O D LODL
MY WHOLE PORTFOLIO IS MOONINGYAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSS
You mong.
BTC is a store of value.
Some alt or variation of bitcoin will be used for transactions for everything in the future, and its value will rise and fall equally with BTC but it will be faster and more convenient.
I will not argue about this anymore, you will not understand
>tfw up 20k in 20 minutes
No one cares about your shitty bcash memes, zhang.No one is going to trust their money in a commiegook-controlled coin.
No one.
Segwit creates an environment in which a 51% attack can be carried out by a mining cartel.
Also off chain is fucking retarded when BTC could literally scale to Visa capacity just by increasing block size.
How does it violate POW?
DO SOMETHING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
S2X price was estimated at 1,2 -1,4 kIt would be a disaster
>link up 30% in 1 hour>ALTCOINS BTFO!!!!!????
DO I BUY ALTS?, DO I SELL EM?
AHHHAHAHAHAHA I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO 11!!!?
THEY CANCELLED IT
ALTS ALL IN
BACK INTO THE SHITTER WITH YOUR BUTCCOIN
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHYCLUELESS LINK TEENS UP 30%AAAAAAAAAAA
Hehe.
You have about the same amount I do.
Feels good to be past the “we’re gonna make it” stage even if I’m not quite at the “I made it” stage.
BTC still can't scale lol.
tech doesnt upgrade>price shoots upreally makes you shitcoin
tfw up 200k in 20 minutes
THE MESSAGE IS SPOOFED!!
HE DIDNT PGP SIGN IT
it can't scale to visa capacity and stay decentralized.
do some research instead of listening to chinese shillsand they completely broke proof of work difficulty, causing periods of huge inflation and letting the chink miners just play games with their coin, probably on purpose.satoshi explicitly designed the diffculty algorithm so that super minority forks like bcash wouldn't be able to exist.
the fact that they changed the difficulty algo is a giant fuck you to "satoshi's vision"
WHAT THE FUCK I PANICED AND SOLD ALL ALTS FOR PEAK OF BTC AND NOW ALTS PUMP AND BTC DROPS AAAAAHAHAH
https://twitter.com/wences/status/928311976173948928Nope, it's real, here is one of the authors.
what the fuck is happening?
you dont just cancel a fork like that, every exchange was already onboard did we all get played????
Bitmex
Tank yes, those were sell walls absorbed literally in seconds.
Moonride continues
/biz/ theme right nowhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Uu12zY01ts&t=1403s
VTC is mooning and I had it at 40k REEEEEEEEE
WTF is happening.
I wasn't prepared for this and now my cash is buried under that fucking kraken shit exchange which can't handle 3+ users at the same time.F U C K
TFW hodling 3 alts>LISK +30%>OMG +20%>VTC +20%in a matter of minutesthis week will be great
Hahaha, BitMEX of course, my dear.
The perpetual inverse swaps are the perfect instrument for shorting bitcoin.
https://www.bitmex.com/register/eY1A09 Fees discounted upon using the link!
not yours if you aint cashed out
If this is such great news for BTC, why is it tanking?
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHORT JUST NOW KEK
As you can see some fucking GOD got in some sells at 10000 USD.
https://twitter.com/BitmexRekt for a peek at some of the nasty action from the sidelines
By the time bitcoin needs Visa level capacity technology will have improved and be cheaper to run nodes.
Storage is already cheap af anyway.As for the difficulty, how are they suppose to mine BX1 level difficulty with a fraction of the hashing power?
It was futures though they are destined to be super volatile.

MUH FREE MONEY DREAM IS OVERLEAVE CRYPTO NOW YOU SCUM AND NEVER COME BACK
looks like they planned it all along.
some insiders just got very rich.
take a look boys, this is what market manipulation looks like
because dumb fucks bought for the "free coin", and now that isnt coming to fruition.
AKA easy money.
I agree, some heavy manipulation is going on here.
https://discord.gg/7avv6XnHop in boys
There wasn't going to be any "free coin" with this fork though..
some Asian whoreI will join when you post the khazar milkers.
I'm a brainlet, why the fuck is it going down!
thats what we know.
You are assuming people that caused the recent surge have an understanding of what the fuck they were doing..
not really, the money is flowing back into alts
people only bought in because they thought a fork would give them 2x the coins like last time
% x 0 = 0
So then why did it go up just when the fork was canceled?
observe market behavior of last BTC fork, hatch devilish plan >accumulate BTC>create a fake announcement of a fork >massive BTC gains, close BTC position, open up alt position>announce "fork" is canceled>massive alt gains we got played hard.
so obvious in retrospect.
this would put you in jail for a long time if the SEC was watching.
>bitcoin is totally a reliable currency guise... even though it routinely rises and falls by $1000, fucking people out of money
Because it was also a sign, that the btc blockchain is safe.
Btc 2x had no replay protection.
sfyl
nobody knows what they're doing, like you
the dream was short lived.. massive dip incoming lads.
time to buy.
ahahahahasee you in hell bitcoin

number one rule is here DO NOT GET GREEDY with your scalps DO NOT OVERLEVERAGE you will get demolished here you are itty bitty sea monkies in a shark tank
Just hold.
The "whales with real money" will pump it to the moon.
just hodl
SELL EVERYTHING GET ME IN ALTS
>people actually think there's this secret currency on the internet that you can use to buy real money with, at the current rate of almost 1:10kwhen are you waking up lads?
the only person who owns or want to own bitcoin is a person that want to trade that bitcoin for real money.
You said this when it was 1000
Crypto will never work today.
You are only in it to make money.
If you are in it for something else, you're retarded.
That's called a store of value, you stupid hick
>link UP 51%hahahaHAHAHAHAHAHAH
/3 confirmations
its kinda too late already :( was wagecucking, this could have been an easy +20% to my pfolio
there are hordes of /biz/ that will tell you BTC is a store of value and it can never go downsold my neo for link, saw NEO moon 20%, got sad>saw linkLOL
Bitcoin - "secret currency"Of course it has always been about getting more fiat.
Some people were smart enough to understand this ponzi-like scheme from the very beginning.
They're rich af now.
BITCOIN KEKS AND NORMIES ETERNALLY BTFO'DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHHHAHAHHHAHHHHHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA GET FUCKED YOU FUCKING CUNTS
They said this when it was 100, 1000, 2000, 5000 and look at where we are.
See, it's crashin'!
bitcoin is fucking crashing right now, kekliterly on mission to the center of earth
helium.
just make sure mask doesnt get off half way.
thats permament brain damage.
Wait for tetther.
We all know whales buy low and they can send millions of dollars cash in a moments notice to a company that you don't even know where it is really located.
HOLY FUCK B2X CHINESE MINERS BTFO.
BTC HONEY BADGER IS INVINCIBLE.
It's $100 higher than it was this time yesterday, and it's leveling offThere is no longer any uncertainty about BTC vs 2X If you think the majority of Bitcoin holdings are attributed to people in it for LOL FREE COINS you are wrong2X was an obstacle, BTC has made the hurdle, and it will continue to climb.
Feels good that I bailed out of that shithole 2 days ago
Just a temporary sell off from plebes who only wanted free coins from the fork.
RIP
"The proverbial slaying of the dragon has commenced."
- Truly mesmerizing
BTC>BagsPick one.
THE KING IS BACK BABY THE KIND IS UNSTOPAPBLE BYE BYE SHITCOIN HOLDERS PRESS F TO DISRESPECT AHHAHAHAHAHHAHAH YEAH BABY IM THINKING WERE BACK WOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOO
God damn people are stupid.It's not about btc vs alts.Now that the fork is canceled, the crypto market will be bullish; both btc and alts.>People who had been waiting to buy btc until the fork will buy now => btc moons.>People who were in btc only until the fork (to minimize losses) will get back to their alts because there is NO fork uncertainty/speculation anymore => alts moon.Have some common sense, people.
7400 again altie niggerswe're not finished with you seething faggots yet
It is about btc vs alts.
Alts are stealing rightful fiat.
MUH ALTS ARE MOONINGLONG LOVE BTC AND IT'S SUBORDINATE ALTS
didi hard fork get canaled or is this just fud?
get rekt, this is what happens when you don't trade real forex
WHY IS IT CRASHINGSEGWIT 2 WAS SHIT
lol give it 24 hours.
didi hard fork get canaled or is this just fud?Pajeet, for Christ's sake.
its not really crashing.
its actually holding pretty strong, but it might crash as people were only buying bitcoin for the fork, now everyone will sell for alts.
i guess.
hOW DO i use google?It's fucking done, no segwit2x.
it really got canceled
Temporary extreme volatilityProbably some fags who were in it just for free 2X coinsPeople dumping when it hit its new ATH a couple hours agoI expect a lot of this up and down today and tomorrow, but reaching 8K by Monday.
I don't really have much stake in crypto, but I did put a little bit of money into Bitconnect, what should I expect?
Bitconnectwelcome to the digital Ponzi scheme my broheim
could honestly see 10k within a week, it's been psychologically accepted
You should expect a site crash followed by excuses on twitter.
Say bye bye moneiz
Getting fucked.
Bitconnect is a fucking ponzi.

first dead cat bounce is currently happening
that is literally a ponzie scheme.
one day they will close all accounts and run.
If would have "crashed" (temporarily gone down by hundreds) even if there had been a fork and 2x insta-failed.
This is just uninvisioned brainlets who were only in it to get free fork coins.
Fundamentals are great though and the resistance to 10K will be wrecked soon.
quads have spoken
FFUCKIG NORMIES RUINING MY GAINS REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Nigger did you buy at $7500 or something?
>mfw this entire thread
What app is that?
or program
42519974252041I mean couldn't you technically say Social security is a ponzi scheme?
I didn't just blindly invest in BCC, I found a lot of positive reviews for it and a lot of well known crypto traders seemed to have good things to say.
It seems like a legitimate company (with a Mkt Cap of $600 mil currently) and so far it's made me profit daily.
Profit that I've been able to either withdrawal or reinvest.
Either way I won't be worried if it crashes suddenly because that amount of money does not effect me, but being able to earn like that, doing hardly anything, is definitely appealing.
THREAD THEMEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8VZe5kqEM
Bitconnect
>comfy btc holders
Fundamentals are great>digital funny money with no inherent value but its ability to make transactions over the internet just avoided adding a band-aid to fix inherent problems that cause transactions to take forever and ridiculously high fees to execute.The absolute state of BTC shills.
expect an increase in development and roadmap announcements from altcoin devs in the coming weeks
There was nothing comfy about the last two hoursLooks like it's finally leveling off though
You can earn money in a ponzi if you cash out before it collapses.
But obviously there are people trying to make it look good to share their ref-link.
Better stay out of ponzis like this and buy some legit long term-coins.
I mean couldn't you technically say Social security is a ponzi scheme?Social security is LITERALLY a ponzi scheme - the fact it's government run and enforced doesn't change that it perfectly fits the description of a Ponzi.
HOLY SHIT YOU CANT MAKE THIS UP HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAND THSRE WERE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THIS WOULD OVETAKE BITCOIN HOLY SHIT LMFAO
they are using new investors money to pay old investors their profits.
Eventually, they will run out of new investors.
Literally what they are doing.
inherent valuecoinlet dumbass detected
no coiner here and I don't give a shit about it but I love HAPPENINGSwhat's happening?
But BCC isn't just a trading bot, it's a cyrpto in itself as well.
A feud over what the real bitcoin would be has been settled before it ever started Huge spike in bitcoin moments before the announcement, then plummeted almost $900 worth, now its leveling off slightly below the previous all time highI'll sleep comfortably tonight, at this rate.
The cancellation of the fork will build confidence in BTC.
What stage is that i am to at that stage
2 hours until the chinks wake upwhat will happen to the alts
You missing out on future economic independence is what's happening.
Going north ramen style!
NEO will wake upXEM will moon time
I coudn't get into bitcoins when they were like dirt cheap because I was living with my parents and they woudn't believe that if I bought 200 of those 10 cent coins would allow me to buy 3 houses,so I just don't give a shit anymore,it would take me 3 months of wage to get ONE bitcoin and I don't believe any altcoin meme,so I just don't give a shit anymore.I just browse /pol/ to laugh at stormfronters and I heard there was a happening here so why not check it
still plenty of opportunity out there anon.
2018 will be a mad year for crypto
shows over, mooning done.Another missed opportunity
I'm really shit at economics,I don't really think I could pull anything offmy best bet would be saving like $200 and investing a little bit on small altcoins and waiting for them to rocket while investing a little bit on bitcoin each week until I make a full bitcoin and then go from there
ok then, keep wallowing in self-pity and stay puur
roll over and die faggconnect!
you faggots are going to be the ruin of crypto, when your garbage ponzi explodes retarded gov angencies will be thinking "uhm...bitconnect, uhm....cryptocurrency......uhm cryptocurrencies are bad m'kay" and we are all going to get a huge regulatory dildo up our asses because of you degenerate faggots, rope yourself and your family handicapped shit eating retard fucking imbecile!!!!
thank you ref link pls!!!111!
dont worry the gov never gave a shit when dump people lost their money
do you think any of these OG shitbirds can predict this crazy ass market?
I waited for over a year before I got anything worthwhile out of it, and then suddenly the x20 profits kept rolling in.
Trade alts, keep the btc and have a shitload of patience
all gains went to insiders who have known about this for hours, days and maybe weeks.
D-Do we sell now?
this.
insiders just made a shit ton of money.
reminder this current price is where we would've been at anyways without the c0rporate buy in for free S2X
Avi shilling his pyramid scheme again>Will just buy more drugs with his gainsNarcos are worse than pajeets
implying anyone here knows what they're talking about
>fucking someone already dumping and pumping hard
sell all and buy DOGE
I mean couldn't you technically say Social security is a ponzi scheme?YES!
I thought everyone was required to lurk on /pol/ for a few years before posting on /biz/, ffs.
