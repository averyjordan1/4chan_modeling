IOC will be releasing DIONS (decentralized input/output name system) with their HTML5 wallet.
You will be able to register a unique name for your wallet, so it will obviously be a race for names like "Apple" since the names are transferable.If it takes off, the wallet names could very well be like the .com craze from the early 2000s when people would register domain names and sell them for a profit.Having an alias to send crypto to simplifies transactions significantly, especially for normies.
No one cares anymore.
1 month long countdown to another 1 month long countdown all but sucked the hype out of this coin.
Not to mention the ongoing alt bear market.
Not to talk shit, but i and i think most of IOC holders are sick of waiting.
A month countdown, then a month more to release.
Im holding 5k IOC and i hope it will 3x/4x to $10, but once it hits that im selling.
This coin looks dead, hype is dead, volume is dead, and the team doesnt do much to hype it.
It was a comfy hold at 35k sats, but you cant daytrade it cause of the volume.
This coin could potentially hit $20, but again, it needs hype and more money flow.
But anyways, DIONS bro
Holding 1.4k, C O M F Y.There's no volume because everyone stakes.There's no hype because they are specifically avoiding that.
It's been stated many times in the slack that marketing will begin after Dion's release.Number 99 in market cap, this shit has so much room to grow it's insane.
