BTC going to drop again?Someone tell me why china was able to manipulate crypto world this much....Its not making sense for me... Am i missing something ... without china mining why cant BTC be stable?I moved my ALTS to BTC.
should I move to BCH?
Yes, you should move them to DGB.
Buy zencash.
This shit is seriously undervalued.
And with the upcoming release of the secure nodes 0.06 can be reached easily
DGB .. No PAL...I am worried normies will move to BCH.
I hate BCH , Any better options /biz ?
we'll tell you https://discord.gg/tdNw5Vp man the fuck up and don't miss out on another moon mission.
You saw what happened with NEO with a little push
BCH is not bitcointhere will never be a flippening, you've been lied to if you believe that.You might make some money by trading it, but in the long term, all alts go down
It was recently pumped a lot.
Agreed Flippening will never happen.What will be the imdt effect?
will there be a BITCOIN CASH rush like last week.
?
Only because Teeka recommended it.
This shit is going to pump for real when the secure nodes are released
many people got burnt from the dump, and they learnt than if you're not holding BTC you're just playing with your money.But there are still some retards who like to be manipulated, so to some degree it will happen
Great idea, real panic will be made when China bans bitcoin mining, faggots will unable to move their shitcoins from their wallets.
Let's start a fud campaign right here.
I want under $2000 bitcoin.
BTC drops -> Rumors are like china ban mining.Neo Pumps -> China opens market.Which one to believe.
As far as I know, many miners already moved some of their mining overseas.There is a new miner too, which had 10% of the hashrate, some people think it might be the new japanese miners doing some testing
