Airdrop soonLimited tokensVC company that shares profits in ETHCheck out those buy walls on ED
Why even shill when there are no sellers.no way im paying 3.50$ for this.
Just wait for a sell wall to pop up
lol only buy walls because nobody will accept this high priceshitcoin
there will never be sellers you fuck.
thats why its a GREAT INVESTMENT.
There are only 4mil tokens, and the token holding looks like this....1.
Holder = 120k astro2.
Holder = 70k astrotop 250 holders = only 2k+ astroThat means no whales exist to dump.
The top 100 holders (anyone who has 20k+ tokens) got in the ICO and are institutional investors who know MATT.
hence why this is being shilled, its a guaranteed fucking money maker.
Either by the 2-5 grand you'll make on dividends every quarter, or the limit supply.
This, the premise of the coin is preventing it from being sold.
The distant sell walls will probably shrink away when they see it mooning.
