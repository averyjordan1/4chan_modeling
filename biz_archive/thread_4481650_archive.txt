Biz been calling a btc crash from 3k due to bitfinex then usdt, meanwhile btc dosnt give a single fuck, will you noobs be calling a crash when btc is 10k?
then 20k?

The same noobs who open a short and just keep getting absolutely rekt by the btc bulls.
RIP
stop trying to short and get in on the greatest bull run in your lifetime
/biz/that's a funny way of saying JTRIG NSA shills trying to convince people that bitcoin is funny money and keep goys from being financially independent from the jewish systems
