Basically thisSo what if its a scam im rich baby
bitfinex shits out tether ponzi tokens to artificially inflate the price of BTC.
this will only end badly at some point
I see, thanks anon
SO I GO ON 5X LEVERAGE NOW?!?
!SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO A NOBO
They will pump neo this time
I like how it’s a joke at this point.
Welp, we’ll be the ones to cash out before the crash...right goys?
We’re not like those other dumb goys.
We know better.
Right?
First of all, we wont beat the insidersThe real question is, how many people are aware of this risk
looks like they don't give a shit anymore about getting caught.
literally pic related going on right now.
how long after the tethers are printed does it usually take for the BTC price to go up?
I just sold so I already won.
I'll play again after the crash.
