Hey there, About to update my website this saturday with next Kucoin results,Last week was very surprising with a big jump to 230ish KCS and 0.02 bitcoins revenue, all that for 0 investment.http://freebitcoins0investment.com/i'll update this tomorrow.
Coss is a better long term investment that Kucoin
Kucoin reduces payment % in the near future.
whoa man i totally forgot about coss,i hold some but i don't think the referral system will be as attractive.why can't we have both anyway?
it has earned me approximately 400 bux this week.suit yourself.
