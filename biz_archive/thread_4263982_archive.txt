We give the BTC ticker to Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin becomes Bitcoin Classic (BCC).

If people like you get their way all the normies will freak out on us and go to the stock market or real estate or some shit!
!ONLY BITCOIN IS BITCOIN- changing that will fuck crypto for a long time!
When I can store my life savings for $5, I don't care about a fucking fee.Also offfchain solutions are the only answer for low fee.
Every blockchain gonna run into same fee problem anyways as price goes up
If any of us knew that, there wouldn't have been arguing about it for the last 2 years
Implementing SegWit, fucking propriety shit of Blockstream into Bitcoin, was a huge mistake.
How did it ever happen?
