Have you actually learned anything about crypto from /biz/?
Or is there just so much shilling, LARPing, and shitposting that you learned all you know from elsewhere and just come here to add to the madness?
I learned much about the G.A.I.O.L system, gonna be rich in notime with that.
Shitposting.
I feel bad for people who buy into pump and dumps on here
I learned about cryptos and I learned about Chainlink.
My world is so much different than it was.
I am a marine now.
