No, I toldd you Confido was a good ICO for quick gains.
Once it went x3 it was just FOMO all over the Internets.
At x10 it was overvalued and its correction was just a matter of time and holding was not an option.But you decided to hold a coin that had already mooned without a product and CEO claiming that they didn't plan to get profit in years to comeNow let me grab those bags of yours at sub-ICO price
