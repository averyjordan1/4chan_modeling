I'm trying to learn margin trading but I am running into problems.
Let's say I want to margin long BCH at 20x leverage on Bitmex.
I have to use BTC for my collateral but I also think BTC is going down so I am guaranteed to take a loss.
That sucks!
And it looks like Poloneix doesn't even let you short BTC?Wouldn't you want your collateral to be in a stable coin like ETH or Ripple during the next flippening attempt?Please help!
Isn't Bitmex leverage options?
Why do you need collateral?
it should be the guy who sold the option who needs it.
