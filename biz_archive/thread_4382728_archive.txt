Hey /biz/ I just wanted to ask you guys what wallets do you guys use and for what coinsNocoiner doing my research
Unless you're making bank and want to throw some money away on a neat gadget, there is no need for a Ledger.
Just store them in a wallet stored on an encrypted flash drive or local disk or such and make sure you have your keys backed up in case the disk fails.
Or if you really want a hardware wallet, you can't go wrong with a Ledger.
I personally own a Trezor which I like enough, but had Ledgers not been out of stock when I bought it I would've got one of those instead.If you're not retarded, a paper wallet will give you the same level of security.
I'm using op pic related and it's so fucking comfyAll good coins are supported so you never buy shitcoins
a ledger nano is not just for safety but also convenience.
you'll never have to fuck around with pvt keys or keystore files.
i used to be a noledgernano-s boy but i dont regret it a single day since i got onewith small gains, dont bother though
Do not listen to people on this board saying you can get away with >an encrypted flash drive>a zip file with a password>a txt file on a google drive account with 2FA>a paper walletthey are idiots, and storing your private key is not the point of a hardware wallet in the first place
Just getting started and im not moving too much money so i am more interested on software wallets
Ledger exit scam when
I'm all into BTC and chancoinI have a trezor, sadly my chancoin is on the pc only though, but that's ok so I can tip and shit
