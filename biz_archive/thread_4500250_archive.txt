45006665 Hours and 10 minutes
how high will this boy go?
-15 minimum.
the peak will be about 24 hours after the meeting so /biz/ has 30 hours to buy in
-12% in typical Binance bot style
nah mate, sell the conference rule applies.
I think it will pump right up until roadmap announcement and then crash down to 9 bucks again
