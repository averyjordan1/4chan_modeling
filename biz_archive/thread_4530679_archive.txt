Is anyone else feeling the same way.
Every ten minutes I have the urge to check BTC and my shitcoins it's all I think about.>be over at thanksgiving dinner with parents>everyone is in the middle of their meal >want to check the status on Dragonslayer and check biz >Uncle stands to make a toast about some stupid shit>still browsing biz under the table hoping to not get called out>Dad stops the toast>"Anon feel free to join the table and the dinner your family worked real hard to make, matter of fact, just take your plate and that stupid phone inside your fucking room.
"The worst part is that I didn't even care.
I was excited to go to my computer and check my crypto.Patiently waiting for everyone to leave to grab leftovers and enjoy the comfy night
>tfw skipped thnksgvg dinr entirely>smoked weed drank coffee read about crypto/laughed/shitposted on biz>and felt like dying
>enter a trade right before going to bed
Yeah dude I know this>waking up randomly with a bad feeling until I check my blockfolio>when working always have a cryptowatch tab open>right now it's 3 am and I can't go to sleep because of that BCH bullshit
it's all i think about.
I only got into it in September and I'm down $10k.
All I can think about is getting rich, and I've stopped all of my hobbies and socializing as it is my only interest now.
It has truly redpilled me, no one wants to fuck with a poor man, only the rich can have truly enjoyable lives, and although I can see the matrix for what it is, I am starting to doubt I will ever be free from it.
down 10k?
what did u do, pls give full larp
Crypto has become my life because my life is empty.I fear what will happen if I don't make it
That's the price you have to pay.
It's a small price in order to become rich.
Sure, i am losing hair and getting dark bags under my eyes but at least i won't have to wagecuck anymore.
Maybe not this bad but pretty close.
Don't be a fag, eat with your family without your phone.
>be in new city>no friends or family>get up and get french toast>do outdoor activity i enjoy very much all day>come home to make pasta>smoke weed>see that my coin went up 80%>trade it make 1/4 eth profit in the trade>feels good
I know that.
I was reading so much about crypto and TA stuff it hit me this.morning about the last three weeks.of.my.life have been crypto trading.
>I made zero money so far because alt bleeding I realize I need to keep working on my world more.
Crypto is still cool though.
Money money if I'm not stupid.
Everytime I wake up I must roll /biz/ faucet and check the prices, and fuck my sleep schedule if I catch a good coin pumping.Crypto made me so fucking jumpy, started with a page taking some time to load and me slamming my desk and screaming, it spread to just about anything now.This morning I spilled a little bit of coffee and instantly went berserk, and asking myself why everything fucking sucked.
I think I'm starting to somatize this shit too because I've been having daily stomach aches.
see that my coin went up 80%>>trade it make 1/4 eth profit in the tradeabsolutely pathetic
