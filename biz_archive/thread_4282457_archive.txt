HAHAHAHASUB 300 ETH SOLD OUT ALREADYGET ON BOARD WHILE YOU STILL CAN
friendly reminder that if ETH survives until Q1 2019 it will 10x.
I can't believe I actually thought this shit was going to be 330 when I woke up.
Markets truly are irrational
its a 30$ loss at worstethereum refuses to go below 300$ for long, if it actually does go that lowfucking ico sell pressure
And here I am, kicking myself for placing an overnight buy order at 306.
Knew I should've gone lower.
soon
all in at 150 and thank me when it moons to 4k+
