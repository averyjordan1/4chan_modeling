Im not saying im doubting or even worried, but when do you guys think that NEO will start to grow?
Is it really that depending on China to work?
currently holding this but starting to think the chinks are moving over to BCH and ETH to fuck with core, only way i can see this rising again is if they flatout allow cryptotrading on the mainland again.
just hold dummy.
2018 is going through the roof
metaverse is better
I was hoping for a growth in it while the battle of BTC and BCH was at its worst.
But allthough ETH made move i the shadows, NEO just kinda stod still :/ Im trying to resist the urge to buy more, but I truly belive its destined to do a lot more then being stuck on 30$....
damn them bags must be heavy
Well, even though I agree with you.
Do you have any reasons as to why it's gonna rise?
I haven't heard any really exciting news in a long time.
Not really, im hodling like a champ, buying 30-40 every week, because I know that when the chinks open up the gates its gonna be the one they jump on.
I know the culture, I know the people's way of thinking.
And they are more patriotic than the americans when it comes down to their system and harratige in future tech.
So don't get me wrong, I'm gladly buying it at 30$, I'm just asking if some of you feel the same way and know something more that is to come.
All the dapps and icos are going to start rolling out next year.
Same shit that eth went through this year.
chinese ethereum
