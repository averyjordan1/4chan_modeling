Miners are some of the most invested in the BTC community.Supporting BCH?>Would put the cryptoworld in a downward spiral, wrecking their gains and more importantly future valuation (that they all know is x10 at least)>some would switch to cause drama and add to their BTC stacks and to also make BCH a solid coin to increase the value of their holdings>That's it, the end.
Both coins ultimately win and the miners get richer
You assume they agree with the plan from core and see it as a good path forward.All evidence suggests this is completely false.
The only people who agree with the core plan are in on it or useful idiots.
It's good for nobody except them, and the miners are just acting in their rational self interest to defect and destroy the core chain in so doing.
They may or may not be wrong about value flowing into their chain as a result, but they're absolutely not wrong that the core chain is worthless.
The whole thing is a ruse!
Bitcoin will never be toppled and bch will never overtake it, because if there is a "constant" threat that bch will "potentially" overtake btc whenever it is massively pumped, naive traders will panic sell and the whales can repeatedly take profits.
I'm certain this situation will remain unchanged for some time.
