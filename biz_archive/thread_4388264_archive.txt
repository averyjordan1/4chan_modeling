What the fuck do I major in /biz/?
I'm reasonably smart, I just can't sit in the same place for too long.
pussy
I just can't sit in the same place for too long.then start off with the longest you can go for.
Then next time, try and exceed that by a minute or two.Repeat until you can sit still for hours productively.It's not that complicated, the real question is do you actually want it bad enough to put yourself through it?
Why even go to school?
Blockchain will make everything obsolete.
just buy LINK, never have to work or go to school again brah
Alternatively: amphetamines/methyl phenidate/modafinil.
yes, that's acceptable too
I know this sounds funny asf.
But..Nursing, you will be surrounded by bitches.
It's not too hard to get accepted in the program.
You can get a job easily.
$70K+ a year (easily).
Where you will be surrounded by more bitches.
If you study 2 more years to be CRNA you can make $100/hour.The only con is you may have to get a little dirty but you will be helping people which is also cool.
