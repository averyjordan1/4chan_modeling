You do realize that bitcoin profits are not income but instead capital gains?
The tax is like 35% of something on short-term investments.
You don't fucking pay FICA on crypto gains asshat
Oh really?
At what point does it become a long-term investment
Jesus, you're an idiot too....Short term capital gains are taxed at the normal income tax level for your income that year.
So OP is right in that regard.Why do none of you know anything about taxes, but all you talk about is investing money?
It's capital gains.
Wait a fucking year and you can cash out at 15% tax.

yeah.
that.
there also is a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income for single taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income above $200,000If your tax bracket including the gain is 10% or 15%, then your LTCG rate is zero.
If your gains push you into the 25%, 28%, 33%, or 35% tax bracket, you will pay 15% on the gains.
Beyond that, you will pay the top LTCG rate of 20%.he'd pay 20% if they were all LTCG + the 3.8% above thx to Obama care
