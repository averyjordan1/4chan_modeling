Just bought 5 BTC at $7970what the fuck do i do now??

You panic sell when it corrects.
you gotta be fucking kidding
buy high sell low
kys or buy Ripple.
buy high sell low, its the biz way
Sell them at 7300 then buy back at 8600.
Is now a good time to sell my profits?
I feel like we're due a little retrace from this high, even if a couple hundred $ it would give me enough leeway to reinvest
HODL?
