make me feel better about this horrendous bag.
what will the price of link be around late 2018.
44c
i only care about lgd
$0.16
link is the next confide
$5.47 on 09-22-2018
We won't get Ripple's market cap, because LINK is the new guy in town.
Ripple might hit the 11 billion market cap, so let's speculate that we get half of it.
> LINK > 6 billion market cap> 350m in circulation> $17 per LINKLet's say the total supply is diluted by an extra 100m coins for the node operators.> 450m in circluation> $14 per LINK
I cant fucking believe people are still holding onto those bags especially after tha """""Update""""".

No man should have to bear a burden that heavy.
