i've got 25% on an exchange and the rest in cold storage.
predominantly holding btc.
in the wake of recent events i'm tempted to spread it across some exchanges - i was burned by btc-e and will not store all my shit in one place ever againwhat bout u?

Gdax...even if it does get hacked, the USD part is FDIC insured and they have a decent track record of dealing with security issues, even if they are fucking dicks and ban people randomly and all that.
Why not just get a couple hardware wallets
In my Ark wallet
Did you get your money back from wex.nz?
Whaaaat the fuck, first time seeing this.
Has anyone got experience getting their BTC-e coins back from wex?
I'll should have at least 2 BTC and an unknown amount of LTC there.
Can reward anyone who can help...?
depends what you're holdingif you have some BTC then yea, leaving it on exchanges if you plan to day trade is okay, kind of a necessary evil since it takes so long to transferif you're mostly holding anything else besides BTC just store the majority (almost all) in a hardware wallet like a ledger nano s or whatever, the transfer times are so fast it's a no brainer
I had like 1.5 LTC on BTC-e...
I used wex, dumped the tokens and got part of my LTC back, its legit
login info should all be the same as your btc-e, you'll be asked to change the password when you log in first time, part of your coins will be in tokens because they didn't have the full balances, you can either sell them now at a loss or keep them and eventually they will make you whole
