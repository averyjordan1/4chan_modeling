BTC mooning while ALTs drop again...
Except ELTCoin and Copico.They're unironically the best two coins to buy right now besides BlakeStar.
And alts hadn't even recovered yet from the last rape.I honestly hate this fucking market now, what the fuck happened?Billions of dollars just flooding into bitcoin every other week for no fucking reason at all
Nope, this is a good thing.If the situation ever flips, and it will, there's absolutely no way anyone will be able to just dump out the BTC into fiat.
They'll convert into alt coins.
Guess what happens to alt coins then?Only problem is when that flip will happen.
Never?
Or soon?Either way, money's going into crypto.
mfw I wasted a year of research and fighting and shilling of alts and I would have been way ahead by being a normie and just having it all in btc
>you'll never see another 20x or oven 10x in your lifetimeI want normies and their boomier tier gains out.
