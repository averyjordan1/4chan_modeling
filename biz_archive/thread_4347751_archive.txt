/g/ here, can I get a quick rundown on what this spicy meme is about?
Someone made a $60mil decentralized JSON parser to send the data to the blockchain.
Don't talk about the original API still being a central point of failure or the shills will show up.
I can't wait until I get to valet my lambo with you while you are still wagecucking in 2020.

Eh I mean I agree with link being overvalued but the original API isn't a "central" point of failure in that it's unique to each data source, nothing can compromise the oracle as a whole which is still a decent step.
Still not worth 60 mil but it's also still a good idea.
