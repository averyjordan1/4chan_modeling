Hey guys I sold my 1.5 BTC at $7000, thinking it would first have a major correction before going up higher.
But now it's already $7500.Do I buy in now or wait ?
Do you think it will go below 6500 again?
Buy in now.
It will go to 10k ;)))Pajeet board, asking for pajeet help.
It will hit 8k before fork then dip down to around 6.5k after.
Anyone claiming it will go to 10k before fork is an idiot.Anyone claiming it will dip to 5k is also an idiot.Be rational.
I'm rational and waiting for 6.5k instead of buying in now.
Rebuy at 6,5k.
Really clever ;)
Anyone who disagrees with my worthless predictions is an idiot.
