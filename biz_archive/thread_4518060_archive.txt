I have Monero, it has great tech and is extremely private.
It will probably have great returns for awhile, too.But, what does the biz think?
Is this just a coin for pedos and junkies, or is it something more?
Monero is the future.
Hold for years
hodl.
Some of the smarter twitter guys i follow seem to be into it.
Hold, and sell it to pedos on darknet at 10x the price once exchanging it becomes banned
Overpriced now but good buy when it dips... sell before it gets banned by your government.
