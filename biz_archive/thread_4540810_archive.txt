I'm so happy this shit show will be over in a few hours.
It has been constant stress since the BCH DAA upgrade.
Sure, I've made nice gains, but it hasn't come for free.
I wake up multiple times every fucking night.
I've had diarrhea every single day.
I make a move.
A few hours later I question it.
Repeat this over and over.
I can't take it much longer.
Thank God it will be over soon.
I'm going in with BCH/BTC ratio of 4 to 1.
Maybe it will not workout.
I don't know.
I don't care.
At this point I just want this shit to end.
