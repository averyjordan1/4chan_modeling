Why the fuck does society tell you to have a bachelors degree and sometimes even a masters degree just to be a measly wagecuck for a shitty company?
Why does it have to be like this in order to make money?
It should be possible to become rich your own way right?
Make 100.000,00 per year itâ€™s not bad at all
Not anymore.
Too many people on earth and not enough resources to go around
You would need to have a bank loan you a lot of money to start your own business or do something nobody has ever done before.
cuz jews
why can't everyone be the top 1%
the secret to not working is measuring the price of things in gold
Because then everyone will be poor.
Also having businesses that charge money for services and products makes it impossible to maintain a society where everyone owns equal value because if people buy your product they will have less and you will have more and if millions or billions of people do this then the people offering the services and products will become the 1% while everyone else will lose value.
