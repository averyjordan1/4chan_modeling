In what exchanges is BTG being sold?
It's doing +20-30% like every day..
none because it isn't out yet
It's done 30% in the last 24 hours.
Other than that, it's been pretty stagnant.
It's still a Future; not yet released.
In case you lived under a rock the last days:DON'T trade futures for things that are not released yet, especially in crypto
