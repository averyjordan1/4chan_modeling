Buying bitcoin at near all time highs.
I've been buying btc on a pretty constant basis since we broke 7k.
How fucked am I biz?
I just occurred to me that I've spenk over 2.5k in what might be the worse possible times to buy Bitcoin.
Am I going to get rekt after this fork?
Or are we going to the moon and beyond?
Jump into bitcoin cash to be safe or you can ride the bitcoin wave before the fork and sell.
IMO, only reason to buy BTC now is if you want to bank on the small points between now and the fork, or if you wanted to trade the alts.If you had no intention of doing those, than you prob should have waited to the fork, because there will be some dip surrounding the uncertainty of who the new market leader may be.
keep buyingwe need idiots like you to lose their money so the rest of us can make moneythanks goy!
the moon and beyondYou'll be fine, just don't panic sell if it falls for a little while before resuming its climb towards the moon.
Bitcoin will be so much more.
But im going to >keep 25% in BTC>Buy 25% BCH>Buy 25% ETP% Some other alts
move it into alts right before the fork or die poor
