Are you holding?
You bet I am
no I sold at 120
 XMR here, feeling comfy since $85
Been holding since $50, nigga
What’s a good price to buy at?
Can I make it with 20 XMR at current price??
Honestly, I think $100 would be a great entry point and would buy more then.
But idk if that’s realistic in the short term and am more of a buy and hold type.
its a 10k USD coin.
xmr and omg are the only alts I hold
It's been quite stable for a while now.
Probably will go up some soon.
4384971So keep accumulating and hodl even at current price??
Waiting for the btc pump bleed to start, 110usd is overvalued currently.
I would say so.
I'm skeptical it would go under 100$ anymore, not at least by huge amount.
