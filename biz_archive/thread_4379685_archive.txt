Heheh.. you panic sold?
Vtc girl?
Seems like Bitcoin Cash
Nah panic bought at $1200.
Feeling quite comfy about it, this shit is guaranteed at least one more pump.
Cheating whore!
Keep telling yourself that.Even the "muh adjustment" meme isn't doing anything as BTC mining profits have been consistently above BCH profits for the past few days, with a very minor blip here and there that would get reversed within minutes.And I'm not a corecuck or cashcuck ideologically, in fact I think the entire bitcoin technology is antiquated when things like ethereum and monero build on it and make it better, but from a purerly monetary point of view BCH failed and BTC is trucking on.
Meanwhile I'm quite comfy as BTC's almost back to ATH while the BCH I never bothered to do anything with suddenly became somewhat useful out of fucking nowhere.
