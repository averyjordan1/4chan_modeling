Let's take a break from all this Crypto nonsense and have a networking thread.
What are some tips for networking, stories on the connections you made, and why it is so crucial for your /biz/ness career.
I took part of a mentee program after graduation, got a small job from it, wasn't bad.Since I've got my jobs from LinkedIn solicitations.I also found my tax man via a tinder date (relative of her).
Actually I found a few "business women" over tinder.I hang around the lockal hacker space often enough to know a few people in a few fields, too.
Small business owners love it when someone shows an interest in their business.
I got a job at a small Pc repair place by chatting with the owner about the work I did and I got an offer from a guy who owned a coin shop to bulk sell online.
This sounds like I would have to go out and talk to people.
Fuck that.
