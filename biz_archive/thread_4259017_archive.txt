Basically under my current plan, I'm bringing home $2,000 base and $3,000 bonus (top 1% earner).
So $5,000 /m.
Upper management sent down a new commission plan for the whole department to sign and turn in Monday.
Problem is:At the same level of performance, I would earn HALF the bonus, so my total take home would go from $5,000 to $3,500.
So they're basically asking me to sign a piece of paper that says I'm cool with them half in my bonus potential.
So do I ask them to double my base pay so I'm bringing home $4,000 base plus they're shitty $1,500 bonus for $5,500 total?
Or do I ask them to revise the commission plan for the whole damn department so it doesn't pander to underperformers and gimp top earners?
ask both
Get a second job.
Only collect base pay from your current job, no commission.
They'll fire you eventually.
But you should probably care about them as much as they care about you.
Get a better sales job you cuckI make 6.5k a month and another 4k in commission per month and i'm still a poor faggot.
Naw I've had easier jobs with higher base hahaSo helpful, thanks man
it would probably be easier to get a higher base rather making them change you commissions to *special* commissions.
I don't think that you'll get back to your prior earnings though.
Yeah it seems ridiculous to ask them to literally DOUBLE my base, but that's the only way it makes business sense to me.
