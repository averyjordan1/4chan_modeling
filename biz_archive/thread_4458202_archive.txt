Is it possible to be profiting in terms of USD but losing in terms of BTC when holding alts?
If so, is that a bad position to be in if you're planning to stay in crypto for the long haul?
YesYesI had 7k and 2.5 btcnow I have 10k and 1 btcyou do the mathnow i only trade for btc
The reason I'm asking is that I'm taking trade signals from a website that does TA for USD/Alt pairs and just assuming that the signals will apply for the corresponding BTC/Alt pair.
So far, it's working, but I feel this small discrepancy has the potential to very subtly screw me in the long run.

>If so, is that a bad position to be in if you're planning to stay in crypto for the long haul?The goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns.
Hodling alt coins is higher risk than hodling bitcoin, but can make sense if you expect the alt coin to have a higher rate of return than bitcoin.
However, if your altcoin is becoming worth less in terms of bitcoin but more in terms of USD, it would be better to just hodl bitcoin.
TAWhy not just roll a dice?

If you're averse to gambling, get out of crypto altogether
