2 MINUTES HERE FOR FUCKING GO
lmao some chick talking about brand expression during their choice of fonts.
what the fuk is this.
Shitty coin being pumped by a group called Bigpumps.
Don't even try to get profit from this piece of shit because the admin has already dumped his big stack on everyone.
:(

can't lie that looks fucking awesome
this
what's the benefits of this?
it looks like a hitbtc but prettier.
Decentralized they say, supposedly wallet to wallet instead of putting your coins on their centralized account to trade.
it is decentralized
4286627In practical terms, what's the benefit of this?
how can a normie see the appeal in this?
lower fees or what?
Hmmmmm gee I wonder...>no hackers can access your coins>the IRS cant access your coins>your coins cant get GOX'd>no need for multiple wallets for all your shitcoins>no need to scan photos, documents, or invasive verification processes>lower feesThe list goes on and on.Seriously, how the FUCK can people call cryptocurrency "decentralized" when the exchanges you buy and trade off of are the most centralized fucking companies ever, with backdoor access to the IRS, and logs of some very personal info?
It defeats the entire purpose.
If the exchanges dont go decentralized, then NOTHING is decentralized.
PERIOD.
No need to keep your coins on an exchange.
No fear of getting Mt Gox'd.
Fees are undefined (i think?)
but apparently going to be lower than places like Bittrex.Can also swap between any coin that's supported.
No need to convert to BTC/ETH to trade defined pairs.
(Saves even more fees, hassle, trade without being concerned of the movement of BTC/ETH, etc)
