Why not buy top 10 or 15 coins in proportion to their market cap?
It'd be like an index fund and a comfy hold, right?
I'll bump once
wtf did the cat die?also, you can't bump ur own thread
Buy a fund in the Iconomi platform.
(Not ICN though)
i mean, two posts straight with the same ID won't bump
I think you need to wait 15 minutes before you can self-bump.
It did bump in any case, this thread was about to die
wew the more you learn, thanks reddit
go 50/50 BLX and CBST on Iconomi
