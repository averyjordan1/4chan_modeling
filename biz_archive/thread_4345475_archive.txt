Not fucking shilling, not fucking telling you how to invest your shekels.
DYOR or dont faggots
Already in ;)
Few questions about this.
PreICO price was 3c yet we pay 25c?
PreICO-ers can sell immediately back to the company so they're effectively guaranteed X8?
Also why do they need a scanned copy of our passports?
Seems like a big security risk.
Presale tokens are locked for a few months
No they're locked for 3-6 months optionally if you want to get an extra 5%/10%.
Other than that you can choose to sell it back to them to avoid dumping.
Still, seems like this could be rife with insiders if they're guaranteed x8 once it hits the markets.
I'm not FUDing btw, I'm still really interesting in the coin, just trying to iron out the details.
These threads are like youtube videos that say (NOT CLICKBAIT)
I want to also point out that this team rewards those with decently sized audiences on say Twitter, Youtube, Medium etc... to basically shill the coin.
Just beware of this when reading anything about it.
Is this a good or bad sign in your opinion?
Im still researching myself and so far there are a lot of positive things about this coin.
Where can I read about these guys having people shill?
Also, I am leaning towards getting into the ico but if you have some dirt, please spill it
Is this th√© coin that starts with w ??
Sorry found answer to my question
Well I understand them wanting to raise awareness, but to me, it just seems slimy or disingenuous.
Just whenever you read about it on a blog etc... ask yourself if the author could possibly be doing this for the reward.
But bare in mind he's obviously in the ICO if he wants the reward so he must genuinely see something in the product.It's in the end pages of the whitepaper.
Also the issue of having to scan your passport is very suspect to me.
Identity theft is rife in crypto, and why do they specify a scanned passport with ALL letters/characters visible?
Why not just a picture of it?
I dunno, seems weird to me.Yes.
