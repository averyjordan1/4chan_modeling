The industry is waking up to POSW.
Things are moving.
Don't get FOMO in a month and wish you bought in October.You get dividends every month just from holding.
The dividends come in the form of more shares.
Every month your dividends compound on top of your dividends.Buy low (now).Hold.Let that shit compound for a while.Sell High, or let it keep compounding.
