/comfy/ threadCurrently sitting on ETH, ETP and REQLife is good.
I managed to make my buys right before bitcoin dropped.
It feels so good to know I'm going to have more bitcoin when I wake up.
I want to thank the anon that was shilling it last week.
I'm up 25% already.Won't be selling any until REQ is a unicorn with 1 billion marketcap.Ycombinator loves unicorns.
They are proud of it.
