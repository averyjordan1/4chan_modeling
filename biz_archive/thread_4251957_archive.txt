Sup /biz/, poor student fag here.I got into crypto 6 months ago with $50.
I turned that $50 into $1200, the most amount of money that I had ever had.
But 2 weeks ago I had to withdraw $1000 to help my parents on rent and living.
I got $240 left ($60 in BTC, $75 in IOC, $50 in COSS and $55 in LINK).I got really demotivated because I had to withdraw my gains, so I haven't followed the cryptogame for few weeks now.
What's going on?
BTC will fork on 16th?
Where will the 2X money flow?
How I can turn that $240 back to +$1000?I don't know what I should do.
That $240 would make my living easy for few months, but I really want to make it.
I just want +$10000, with that I would be set for few years and I could finally buy a driver's licence to maybe get a job finally...
SEGWIT2X CANCELED GET READY
X got cancelled nigga
you're not going to make it with that attitudealso lol at cashing out crypto ever
They're already crashing
I had to help my parents that's why I cashed out.
And ofc attitude aint the best when I had to take out 6 months of gains.4252010I see.
I just wondered why LINK started to moon.
Which coins are u guys sitting on?
I am going to buy NAV with my BTC, I think that there's nice 20% on the way tonight.
Thoughts?
