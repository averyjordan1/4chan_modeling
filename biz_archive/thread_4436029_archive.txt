THIS THREAD IS FOR LOOPIES ONLYdiscussion: what are your plans for loopy Monday?
deposited all in long term LRC contract cant touch it .. long term hold BRO .
C0mfy
18 months hold minimum contract ...
What are the benefits of using a contract
Why did you do that?
after 18 months get 50% increase in LRC tokens due to the company depositing in the contract and amount that was put in by investors.
Thats based ont the formula on the website, and it becomes exponential increase if u hold longer than 18months.
Probbaly as an an incentive so not evryone takes it out straight away after 18 months.Basically there are some tokens locked up .. long term holders
IIRC it said deposits into contract ended Oct 29 already too
Any other good contract recommendations
long time
The mid-term incentive program was suspended, maybe it will come back soon http://incentives.loopring.org/longterm-incentive-program-en.html
