Want to make mega$ consulting companies how to use psychology & machine learning to improve their businesses.
Anyone got experience in consulting?
Or is /biz/ just for gambling?
just for gamblingyep.bye.
offer something cheap, make them like it, and then get more expensive
But if you charge very little, won't they be skeptical of the value you offer?
