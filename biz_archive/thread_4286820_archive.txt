Alright boys, the time is coming.
They pushed their token sale back to 12/21 citing getting fully registered with the SEC and to test their token issuance protocols further.The project looks promising.
They're already the largest cryptocurrency ATM company in North Carolina and have the distribution in place to expand to almost 1,000 at the drop of a hatThey've got the first Ethereum-based dual token system that functions similarly to NEO/GAS.
Not to mention Cream Cash aka CASH is stabilized and will drop a steamy turd on Tether's head when it rolls out.
They have less regulatory hurdles dealing in crypto-crypto exchanges as opposed to USDT doing fiat-crypto.I don't have time to list all of the benefits, just fuckin look for yourselves.
It's dope and I'm buying in the pre-sale at a sweet $0.525 per token.I know token sales are mostly scams but there is an actual functioning business behind this project that is already generating revenue.
Thanks for the heads up OP, I'll put some research into this.
