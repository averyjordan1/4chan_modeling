How is this guy even significant in Ethereum?He was a part of the release "smoothening" team long ago.
Not even involved in development.All he does is walk around branding himself as a "Community Big Shot".And people are losing their shit because he has "CEO of Ethereum" in his twitter profile.
This is beyond hilarious.
please pajeet and shitters, disavow him, dont tell me you are all commies like canadian soyboys
Vinay is mentally ill and should be ignored.

?Did you read my post to mean the opposite of what it said?Tangent: Neither communism nor capitalism is inherently opposed to anarchy, though in their anarchist forms, both have mechanisms that will lead back to the centralization of power unless the culture prevents it from happening and there is a constant struggle to maintain anarchy.
