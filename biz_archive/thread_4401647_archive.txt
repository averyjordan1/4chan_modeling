Blocknet and Komodo have been doing this for almost a year.
The absolute state of the crypto community

Who gives a shit, it wasn't:>Decentralized anonymous BTC/LTC swap market
I need spoonfeeding.
wtf is atomic swap and why should I care?if it's just another shapeshift then I'm out.
Who the fuck cares you fucking nerd, just go all in ltc nigger

Thats exactly what it is.
Plus Komodo does it all the time with different coins.
BlockNet gets no attention, this whole market is irrational and filled with FOMO and FUD.. Nobody shills BlockNet because its a fucking good project.
