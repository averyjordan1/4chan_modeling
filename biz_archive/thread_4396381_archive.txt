Be honest, if you had bought Bitcoin back in 2011, would you have had the patience to hold?
Would you have been strong enough to make it through the MtGox dump?
Nothing has changed.
There are top 100 coins right now that will be massive in 2022.
Obvious coins too, not like hidden gems.
And additionally, you don't actually have to have the courage of a first adopter like you had to with Bitcoin.
Crypto has proven itself, so no faith is necessary.
Will you have the patience?See you in 2022
you motivated me anon 
hodling ark till 2022 desu
Smart.
If you don't want to miss out on moon missions and the joy (pain) of trading, just separate some small amount of your portfolio (or even better: don't touch your portfolio and add some money for a trading portfolio) and trade that.
Don't touch your main coins at all
King BTC - it's shit but the Jews will carry this to centralization and control over the world.ETH - Corporate platform.XMR- for the original vision of Bitcoin.Everything else is pump and dump.
Fuck no.
The only way I would have bitcoin from 2011 is if I forgot that I had them.This is also one of my worst fears.
Selling a coin I hold to get 5x gains only for it to reach 1000x
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
No one can see the future
I know for a fact I wouldn't have held bitcoin this long so that makes me feel better about missing outprobably would have sold at around $400 at the highest
I held 10 BTC from early 2013 and completely forgot about them until earlier this year, it's what actually got me into crypto again.
