How much money do you think those fucks heading the 2X project made in the last few weeks?Push 2X and drive BTC price up, destroying all alts.
5 days before planned fork, buy into main alts, announce the cancellation and get 30% gains.
Go back into BTC and be comfy as fuck.It's delusional to think those 6 fucks didn't make any trades based on this.
What a load of shit.
so theyre up 1000% in 12 months, and you think they would risk their livelihoods for another 30%...ummmmm......riiiiiight....
What fucking livelihood?
This isn't some SEC regulated space where insider trading is illegal.
There's zero repercussions for doing this.It's SIX people, it's not like they couldn't easily have planned this.Of course they would take another 30%, what kind of stupid question is that?
this.
everyone behind the s2x fork should be shot in front of their families
If you didn't buy the alt dip you are a fucking retard anyway and should just stop doing crypto
