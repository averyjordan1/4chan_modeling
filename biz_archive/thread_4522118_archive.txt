Been doing this for months now
I do it while working so its cool.
Well I made a few hundred bucks while also working, not a bad feeling whatsoever desu
Was like youDecided the best is to NOT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT YOUR CRYPTO MONEYyou got potential +2000% or -100%honestly investing in meme coins is fun, and when you make gains you feel even better
i mean, it is draining, but i did make over 6k today on POWR and SUB.comfy holding SUB until end of january too.
now i just need to stop refreshing this shithole every 5min and go do something productive when im not trading.
