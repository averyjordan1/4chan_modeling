This is a "moon" in the head of a Bitcoin bag holder.This is where 95% of /biz/ Bitcoin bag holders enterred this trade.The opportunity cost of being in this trade VS. having even trivial amounts of gold is too high.
Dump your shit bags and buy a main stay coin.
Stop worrying about your shit coins every day, morning, and evening, constantly checking your Blockfolio to see if you went up a few dollars.
So does that mean that LINK isnt worth getting into till 3 years?
hahah fair point but i do think it has really great long-term potential, really stoked to see where it'll be 1-2 years from now
Really depends how quick partners are to announce/implement.
The fact HCL endorsed Chainlink hints there is allot happening behind the scenes.
Are you talking about BTC or ETH?
comparing erc20 shit tokens to btcnice try pajeet
chainlink
Glad I bought it during the crowdsale :^)
