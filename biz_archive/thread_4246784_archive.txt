So what is the difference?
And are they worth anything in the future?
Both good coins with an actual point to them, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything in this market where some useless horseshit coin gets pumped and good coins get ignored.
that's what i thought.
i really like the idea behind them but it struck to me that they are both sort of trying to fix the same problem
