Argue what is going to happen aproximatelly in 6 hours related with the fork.
Lets talk about that
What fork?

I feel like alts are fucked no matter what happens.
What fork?
BCH will settle around $1300 and slowly lose its value, just like the last time, probably stops around $300 - just like the last time.BTC continues as normal.
I think BCH will settle around 1k5... and be something like 1:5 to BTC
