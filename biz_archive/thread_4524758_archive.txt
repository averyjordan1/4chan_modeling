When the fuck will this shitcoin recover?Tired of bagholding my small bag, boguht in at $53 on a whim...
dont you dare buy this shit, ive been bagholding for months and will probably baghold for a year or more if im that lucky
do you realize how much potential money you lost by not taking your losses and investing in any half decent coin?
I got my entire portfolio destroyed when I bought this garbage in the $150s.
but I made everything back and am still profitable overall because I accepted my loss.
this is what holding LINK does to your brain
lmao you're still holding it?I sold mine at $120 after ICO because I literally made over $100k and had no clue what it actually did and didn't care tbqh since I just made about $180k for clicking a few buttons.Like  said you could have probably made it all back by now if you just bought something else.I took those profits though and got OMG'd though; but at least this coin has a future.
Average buy-in is only $6.70 too, so not a big deal.
Figure it'll make me a multi-millionaire next year desu
This will never ever recover.
The point and only point of this token being listed on an exchange is to provide liquidity to the data scientists who are rewarded for their work in Numeraire.When the price unexpectedly spiked because people buy stuff without reading the whitepaper, the hedge fund reduced the awards to the data scientists buy 90%.
There is no upside to this token is supposed to trade flat.
Forever.
after icowoops forgot it wasn't really public.
Bought it off a computer lads I knew who told me it'd go nowhere since the project was vaporware most likely till 2020.They sold me there's and I cut them out of my life after I made the $180k.
Didn't really care for them anyways desu
