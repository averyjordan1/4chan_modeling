Nah.
Chancoin is the true bitcoin
baaaaagholders
Chancoin is the internal currency of 4 Chan.
Proud to shill thisWouldnt mind some 4CHN paycheckAnyway this coin - big in few years
The mining's getting easier, and the devs are working on more shit, so get in while we're down
mining is exactly the same as its always been>dev not working on anything besides keeping bagholders at bay with pretend/sloppy projects
The current Chancoin is little more than a Litecoin clone with some very small changes (diff retarget time is 2 blocks, testnet min diff, etc).
Obviously, in order to actually provide features and usability for the coin, we need to change that.
Andy decided to fork a very old version of litecoin (0.8.7) which doesn’t even have the features we want, so we’re going to need to change that as well.The biggest point on our unannounced roadmap is updating Chancoin’s codebase to the latest version of Litecoin.
This will allow us to actually start doing stuff, and name has gotten a pretty good beta version working already - we just need to squash some bugs and that’s it.
Once we have the updated client, we can start working on real features, most notably, blockchain-based data storage and Cloverhash, our new mining algorithm.Cloverhash will solve many, many issues, most notably the complete domination of ASICs.
In the current Chancoin mining scene, it’s practically impossible to get a block mined using a regular GPU.
Cloverhash, based on Dagger (the same mining algorithm that Ethereum, Zcash and many other coins use) and Lyra2RE (Vertcoin), makes it extremely easy for the end user to mine Chancoins using their normal graphics cards and immensely helps with decentralization of the network.
Blockchain-based data storage is another very interesting feature we are exploring.
Using OP_RETURN and transaction metadata, we can store long strings of information on the blockchain, without any central server.
With this, we can then develop:- Tripcodes and usernames stored on the blockchain!
This eliminates the need for those huge ‘$4CHN:’ names on imageboards and allows us to link usernames on other websites (Twitch, Youtube, Twitter, etc) to a specific Chancoin address, which can then be sent coins to using the tripcodes stored on the blockchain.- A blockchain-based chan archive, in which users pay a certain amount of coins to upload a post to the blockchain, thus effectively archiving and storing it *forever*.- An imageboard, or forum, stored completely on the blockchain.
Keep it rolling!
Get exodus support and I'll fall for it

Love this coin.
Love devs (HOT GAY)

Because it probably is, bunch of retards is mindlessy bumping this thread without 0 content, while getting some coins ans ruining those generals.
It would be better if there weren't any chancoin generals if they are gonna look like this.
its almost as if its a general.
Thanks!

''Just a tiny update - we're still hoping to shore up the 0.15 release (which will bring parity feature-wise with Litecoin 0.15 as well as a new hash algo we're calling Cloverhash) before the year's end.
I've been behind various aborted projects such as our own mining pool, and am currently working on coinhive integration that pays out in chans.Theres other nascent projects in the works, but as things slow down for the holidays (at least in the US), please bear with us if we fall behind on a few things.
The project is still very much alive, and we'd still very much love to talk to you on our discord server.Gossamer''


Looking forward to the 0.15 release
Channers are broke young faggots, horrible audience to get to pump up a coin
Price and volume up today.
