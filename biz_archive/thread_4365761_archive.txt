i bought that chain something a week ago like you guys said it will go up to moon and sheit.i opened up my good old coinmarketcap site i bookmarked cuz it looked intelligent and all that and sam of you use that daily to check the coin prices y'all smart and i tryn to learn from ya folks.so i typed in chain in that search box thingy and ended up buying chaincoin cuz i know it was chain something.now i think you wanted me to buy chainlink tho?but i made almost 3x my money back with chaincoin, should i still go in chainlink?
its fine its literally inposible to lose money in crypto so its ok
