nucoiner here, as long as I bow low and sell high, I'll make a profit, right?
Lets say I bought 1, BTC at 6.5k, sold it at 6.2, it dops to 5.2k, i bought back 1.17btc and then sold those at 6.5k again, I'm up; right?
As long as when I walk away from it all I sell higher than my initial buy in, Please correct me if I'm wrong.
6.5 > 6.2 = $300 loss1.17 BTC @ 5.2 = $6084, selling at 6.5 = $416 profitYou would be in the green $116.This completely ignored transaction and exchange fees though.
you got it all wrong dude, take that shit to reddit.
Here at biz we buy at the all time high cus we see lots of support and we don't wanna miss out, right?
And then we sell when the shit tanks cus who wants to be a faggot bag holder?
Not us!
Why didn't you buy BCH yesterday at .4 and sell today at .18????
Do you wanna stay rich for ever????
You’re wrongYou’re gonna want to buy the all time high and sell at least 20% lower.Then buy the recovery (at the top) and sell it lower again.Then return to /biz/ and post pink wojaks.
Its the only way.
