Ahoy /biz/ have any of you tried Clickbaiting on Youtube?
Seems to be pretty profitable if done rightI've been trying to be a youtube clickbait champ for 2 weeks now; choosing different topics I think will catch peoples eye; thumbnails with obnoxious circles and arrows to trap children into watching my garbage.
however it turns out it's not as easy as it looks; and throwing slides together and talking is all I had planned to do because pictures aren't as hard to deal with monetizing as videos are.I know I'm walking a fine line here by posting my channel so I'll post a sample video link and explain my thought process.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxlRrYFNv-Y&t=39swith this one I actually mention a 4chan story because making shit up on my own isn't the point of the channel.
It's pumping out quantity to acquire subs and views.Now what I've been told is I need good watch time on the videos; and around 200-300 views to get it put in recommended; However this is very hard to accomplish without a large subscription base.
Besides spamming le reddit what else could I do to increase my chances?thumbnail is my thumbnail I used.Also I know a guy making 3 dollars per 1000 views right now and netting roughly 3k on a slower month so I know it's viable; and all his content is trash tier like this; it's just about sports.
I know a guy who does it and he doesn't do anything special; it seems a lot of it is like the lottery; throwing giveaways in helps a lot; and having blatantly deceiving stuff in your titles
