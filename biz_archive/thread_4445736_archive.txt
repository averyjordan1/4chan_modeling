See you on the moon fegs.
Wanna tell me what this is so I can buy it
Coinsmarkets check there.
It doesn't even tell you what the goal is for that.It's not even listed on cmc
Anon careful with all those new MN coins out there.
Quite a few literally copy&pasted coins have been listed lately, usually on those ultra low vol shitcoin exchanges like stocks.exchange and coinsmarket.Dyor!
Look at their github & if there is any active community with active discussion (telegram / discord or Slack)
I'm on their website.

It's called ALQO and its a copy and paste pajeetcoin
just saying, be careful.
I noticed a huge surge in shitcoins with MN as their one and only selling point .
MN seems to be the new up and coming meme out there, easy to get burned ;^)
