QTUM is so much beter than NEo not sure why it's not getting the recognition.
Asians actually buy this unlike NEO..
Massive amount of dapps coming out and QTUM will be the leader in mobile dapps.
nice try nigger name one reason why anybody would use this shit over ethereum or neo its just a shitty erc20 knockoff token
It's a legit coin, it doesn't need shilling.
The thing shills itself, unlike NEO.
Their mainnet has been up for some time now.
They only used ethereum network and the token for ICO purposes.I had some QTUM a month ago and the wallet and staking process was really simple and painless.
ETP is even better
I wouldnt waste time on something that wants to build a satellite.
all these knockoff wannabe chink coins are pointless.
ethereum will destroy them all other than maybe neo which seems to have gotten government backing based on the 40% moon today.
qtum isnt even chinese its just some asian fagcoin with no purpose.
Let's say LINK would send a satellite.
You really think /biz/ wouldn't go absolutely mental?
I bought it because I like the logo haven't lost any money yet
