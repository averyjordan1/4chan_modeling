But then you donâ€™t know anything about the market
Majority of active traders can't beat holding even on the when they have an index.Yes there is about 30% of active traders that can beat the market, but these people usually have research times and PHD writing algorithms etc etc.If you know nothing about trading, you probably will lose money if you don't just hold because of emotion based trading (buying on hype and selling on lost hope).So...
It works for most people better than day trading.
