Sort of a meh bro.
Preorder 5 min for 16 Th/s @ 1400 watts and they're delivered in March of 18?
You'd be better off buying a December or January ASIC from Bitmain.
k a piece and electrical billsWhat the fuck can you even mine at with those specs that would be profitable?
How much bitcoin,zcash and other junk can I mine?
Good luck beating bitmain with those soon to be obsolete dragon dildos
Zcash on asicm8...Anyway this thing is only worth if you have 3rd world electrical costs or if you can hide the thing at work or some nasty shit
Is this what operation Dragonslayer was?
>Shipping begins in March 2018what did they mean by this?
4510470>shills BCH in other threads>say they do it because they believe in BCH>actually shilling a mining equipment company>also owned by the owner of BCH
Also my first thought.
Would be a bit of a disappointment desu
Just wait till the japs put that ugly chink out of business for good
The free market will make mining decentralized eventually.
Big blocks now pls.
Operation dragonslayer was an attempt to shill BCH before the Dragon Mint chips start coming online.
These chips are being developed by people connected to the Dragon's Den slack group who are connected to Blockstream.So basically, BCH shills are panicking that soon Core will have mining power to stop Bitmain from fucking over the Bitcoin network.
Competition to the chinese miners, which is what all of this FUD storm has been over.
The Mining sector needs some healthy competition.
Spoken like a true short-sighted asshat
The free market will make mining decentralized eventually.>He actually believes this will ever happen with PoWChina plz go
