A JSON PARSER
what does it mean
Chill link is an etherium token, btc crashing only plays a minor role why the coin is down

They're not going to contact exchanges.Doing so could put them in further violation of securities regulations.They're playing it safe at the bagholder's expense.
Jason Parser is the lead dev of FUDcoin and he announced in his Palm Oil Confidential that LINK was going to be $1 billion per token per hour.
so why dont exchanges contact them?
Link is probably the best implementation of JSON.parse() I've seen yet.
