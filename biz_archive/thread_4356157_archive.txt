>"Uber of crypto"No its so much more.
"Uber of crypto" would just be a tiny app on their platform among many others that would have much higher market cap pressure.
This could be used for IOT locations and most importantly, it could be a network that informs AI in driverless vehicles way more efficiently and with much more types and better quality of information than anything that exists today.
This is the REQ of locality information and also information that can be derived from it.It's easily one of the highest marketcap potential tokens that exists right now.
