I like how NEO is just dropping in USD but going up relative to BTC
There is not a more comfy hold than neo
this is what happens to all coins that arent in the middle of a pump and dump when bitcoin drops, because bitcoin is the only thing providing fiat value to all of these coins.
Green id and dubs confirms
Neo and Ark are the comfiest
except bittrex is actually good about having alternative pairings and you can buy NEO with ETH or USDT
what exactly is neo's adoption plan?
does it have any competition in chinkland for smart-contract blockchains?i know of qtum but thats just a copy of bitcoin with the EVM pasted on top of it.
