Is it better to work in a small company or a large one?I like where I work but I feel cucked in a few ways including lack of room to progress, salary and health benefits I'd have at a large company.
When is it time for me to move on?
In a small company, you're more valued as an employee.
In a large company, you're very replaceable and won't be valued as much.
There's also more office politics.
