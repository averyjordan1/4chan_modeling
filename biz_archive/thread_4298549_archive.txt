Has anyone had much success so far with either PoS or dividend issuing coins?
What kind of gains can be expected / thoughts on whether Astro is as good?
Coin should produce about 12.5c/coin per million dollars the company makes every quarter.
So its a decent return on investment.Otherwise, only 4M coins, and small marketcap.
Good buy at the moment.
