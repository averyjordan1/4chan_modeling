LRC shiller at your service ;) Should thank me for the learning experience desu
4493119this is a pure shit coin just like confidoI instantly knew confido was shit, it went to shit, this coin is pure garbage tooI should have went with my gut on powr but people talked me down, fuck yall i'm doing this my way now, i'd be up 3 grand if i followed my instincts..
the feeling when you bought POWR at 5.5 cents and sold at 10 cents to watch it go to .70Would be retired right now...
I got lrc way too late literally lost Â£80 in 2 days which was 1/3 of my total investments
