I don't understand the psychology of bagholdersEmotional attachment?Delusion?You guys are fucked in the head and shouldn't be trading.
A cool unemotional trader would cut his losses and start making money again.
See 
LINK is basically a whitepaper and 2 autistic devs and you think it's worth 32M+?Rory is a brainletSergey is not that good and spending his ICO money getting his dick sucked 2 autists and tech nerds =/= a good business So far they have delivered NOTHING.
LINK is a vaporware dog shit coin

If you want to make a worse one, sell it now.
Perfect opportunity to average down boys heheh
Vapourware dead coin, sell before 1500 sats then 500 then 0

how fast do you expect 2 autistic devs to work?
