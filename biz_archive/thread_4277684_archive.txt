You'll make it back, try not to take the loss so hard it'll only make things worse.
Watch some soothing animes
Sold my BTC at $7700 via JMBullion 10oz gold and spit rest into BCH, LTC, ETH, ARK and bought 1,000 ADA for shits.
Sorry Anon it’s not to late to diversify through the Fork
I know your pain brother.
I went from 5k to 700 dollars.
Dont hold for a coin for more than a month.
tfw i gained 1000 in one weekYou can have a dollar back if you show butthole with timestamp.
MUST BE ANIME HAMSTER.
I know that feel man.
I bagheld ODN from ICO to $.25 cents before finally giving up on it.
Just a few days ago I tried to arbitrage some shitcoin...bought where it was cheap, went to transfer it and by the time the transfer went through (like 3 fucking hours later) the price was back to where I bought at.
If I would have just left it on the exchange I bought it from, I would have made $500-1000 because the price there eventually matched with the other exchange.
I was so fucking pissed I couldn't sleep that night.
who cares?
Try losing your first 100k
Did u not make it back in these last 2 days?
ya I'd probably just kms
Yeah I’m in that club too.
It sucks.
I lost 10k in the last 10 days, including 2k yesterday.Excuse me while I KMS
Try your first million, bubs.
You can make that in 5mins in crypto world.
Went from 3k to 100k now down to 40k.
I’m still up but still could have had more
I lost $40,000 in 3 days in April.
All that really matters is what percentage of your portfolio you lost.
If you had 2k free spending money that you didn't need and you decided to try investing, and lost 1k then yeah pretty sizeable loss.
If you are someone with 200k that's just half a percent.
In what did you lose so much?
