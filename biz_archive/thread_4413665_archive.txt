Overbought
happy birthday!enjoy your free power ledger money :-)
Exactly.
Will dip soon.
But long term this is one of the few projects to hold
no way it is testing previous ATH soooon
Don't think so.
RSI looking good on both 1H and 15M.
Any dip will be minuscule anyway.
Weakhands were let go already
Looks to risky right nowMaybe at the next dip
trueoverbought doesn't logically imply a dip, it could keep going far up or do a: stabilize, rise, stabilize, rise pattern which is what it has been doing now

Buy and set conditional sell order at 0.00003588 behind the 222917.12035882 wall just in case it breaks out.
Limit your exposure.
If it breaks through that wall, set buy order at 0.00003250
No sell orders, we're going up.
What do you expect the price point to be in the next few days/weeks?
-35c until the 20th we'll moon to 50c
It's dumping
