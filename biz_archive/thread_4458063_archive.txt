WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
It means you can now buy NEO with BNB or USDT on Binance.
Not wanting to speculate in a speculative market.
You will fall behind.
Last time they added a USDT pair (BCH) it pumped hard in just a few hours.
Making it more normie friendly is setting it up for a pump n dump.
I'm buying up myself.
finally I can trade these stupid bonobos out of my yard
So you can trade directly for two shitcoins that will eventually be worth 0?
