I've lost 50% since yesterday.
Should i just throw everything in ETH and quit looking at crypto for a year.
Luckily, I'm not swinging form a noose right now because I didn't invest more than I could lose
yes
ETH will benefit massively from all of this
started with 1200 in august, fell to 850, because of the dip, through my own retardation couldn't hang on to my gains from STR.
had multiple chances to break even.
Bitcoin Cash was a blessing from god.
Got back up to 1,200 yesterday.
wake up today, back down to 850. continue to buy high sell low through emotion and panic.
now at 600. i guess ETH can help me sleep tonight.
Luckily I was awake during to bch debacle last night and made a killing, transferred it all to ETH around 5am and finally went to sleep after a very stressful 5 hours of exchange watching...If I had been asleep?
I would be fucking pissed.
The people behind this bitcoin flippening are crooks and they are losing people tons of money.
Not that I care but this has a very negative effect on the market and outside investors' views of crypto which may halt new money from coming in.
newfags and normies ruin everything they touch(ex.
gaming) so i'm actually happy that new money won't come in
