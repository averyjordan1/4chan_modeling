I have $4500 to invest and want to buy bitcoin, when would be a good time to buy though??
Been waiting for the dip but it keeps fucking rising.
I have .115 BTC right now, but would prefer to go up to 1 BTC instead of .72No fork now either.I have 1.7 ETH too, might buy .3 just to have 2.
I remember waiting for the dip when it was 1800, I bought at 6000
fug, still waiting on the bank transfer which is taking ages
BUY it when it's crashing.
well, consider that bitcoin has an average of 800% returns per year, then try to time the market based on that.
Yesterday.
You literally just missed the fork drama shit being over rocket.
Basically everything is up 20%

Not now, we are about to get a correction.
Noobs will panic and they will drive the price down.
