Don't mind me
I'm trying to finish a nicehash minimum payout this month and then go back to ETP.
When will this explode and kill my mining efforts?
I'm hoping next year.
Holy fuck this bag is hurting me
hurting?
pretty comfy desu
Holy shit , you will make it anon.
i have being holding my metaverse bags since they were 4.50. never sold them
What news did i miss, or whales finally got rid of the sell walls?
you need to learn to trade bro
Riding this up right now
how the hell could i know etp was gonna crash from 6 to 3 ??
because the alt market got holocausted, you should have been 90%+ btc during that time
Why.
Just why.>have been holding ETP since 1$>decide to sell half FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER to gain from BTC>literally in two hours ETP rises from 3.02 to 3,3>Buy back like a faggot, PROBABLY IN THE ATH
Will get dumped to 3$...have seen whales do this a few times on ETP now.
It's not it's time to moon yet, especialy with BTC mooning.
But yeah this coin has a bright future.
Literally why..Posting from phone but WHAT THE FUCK
yeah you could be right.
I'm in for longterm so I dont really care
Sell ETP only in two digits
Tug of war between shorts and longs right now, something tells me bulls have the upperhand in this one.
yup, im aiming $3.50 at least tonight
437856610$ or I'll kill myself
When moon
Now, TA says 5,50 in 2,5 hours
$5.50?lol good luck with that, im already starting to deleverage btw

Hello 3.51$.
Binance is coming on November 17th and the whole US can finally get into mvs.
any targets my man?i'd quite like it to hit 0.001 btc, possible?
You really don't understand...you will get dumped.
This is no time for alts to rise.
With light wallet coming out soon, moonshot is definitely brewing.Reminds me of Antshares back in June.
