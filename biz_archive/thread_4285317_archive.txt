Is there any truth to the claim that exchanges require an NDA?
I see a lot of these claims from people defending coins/tokens on small exchanges...'devs are working on getting into a bigger exchange, but nda forbids them to talk about it'
Bittrex 100% requires an NDA (not sure about the others)
A lot of better ones do.
Bittrex and Kraken do.
Not sure about Polo.
I'm betting GDAX does but nothing was getting added until that announcement said they were listing new things.The reason for the NDAs is insider trading.
The exchange buys up a huge amount of said coin or token and then lists it to sell at a much higher price.
