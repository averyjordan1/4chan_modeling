I'd just like to interject for a moment.
What you’re referring to as Bitcoin, is in fact, Blockstream Coin, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, Shitcoin.
Blockstream Coin is not Satoshi's vision, but rather another component of Jewish bankers controlling the monetary system.
america takes over bitcoin with jews>chinese make BCH>BCH says its real coin but it's actually chinese copy even though it's closer to the real coin than the now core coinBTC vs. BCH essentially
