$600 ETH can't wait to be here!
I think eth goes up because people taking profits in bch trading bch/eth pair or selling btc to eth to survive the storm.
Hypothetical question: If BTC and BCH meet at 1:1 in a downwards BTC trend and upwards BCH trend, will you swap your BTC for BCH or will you (((suffer ideologically)))?
That's when you buy XMR.
If BTC goes in 'death chain' spiral people will panick.
Just be prepared for both outcomes just to stay safe - doesn't matter if you're BTC or BCH supporter - stay open-minded.
that is why I hold 100% ETH now, it is so safe
Economically, it is pretty unlikely.
BCH gets most of its value by being a fork of BTC, not from being opposed to it.
This is what BCHeerleaders often miss.
If BTC goes, it lands on top of BCH as it falls.
BCH is squashed first.Don√§t forget there are huge numbers of people invested in BTC who got in early, and to them, losing $100 several years later is no big thing.
They aren't really losing anything.
Mix that in with latecomers who may lose thousands and will grip tight no matter what the loss.
That creates a robust ecosystem where hands will remain held for the long run.Compare with BCH, where most hands were given out free as part of an airdrop.
When it looks like that is starting to slip, the guys who have been speculating will cash out for the last time.
