Is there a decent /biz/ approved guide for getting into cryptos?
Want to into coins but everything I've read is either too nonspecific or talks only about bitcoin when I want to buy more obscure altcoins so I need a comprehensive guide.
Don't want to accidentally send money to scams.Too bad /biz/ doesn't have an ultimate guide or its own wiki in the sticky like /int/.
This is a money oriented board.
Nobody gives a fuck, and would rather spread misinformation since more people taking advantage of something for money = less money to each person taking advantage.

You need the mindset that 9/10 people here are either actually retarded or getting paid to try to fuck you over.

Buy TIO on Etherdelta, yet to be on coinmarketcap.
only 450k in supply, strong project /community with active team, currently trading at $0.1, this will easily get over $1 when it gets to CMC.
their threads on Bitcointalk are jumping with life.
Not like that confido that had only 7 pages of activity on their announcement thread and people were putting money into.
Anyways Do you own research.
Gdluck!
