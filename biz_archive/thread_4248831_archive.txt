Wow, you must listen to this people, i think i found the best way to make money, it's like $7 per HOUR !!
It's just incredibleI just went into this shop, and all i had to do is putting things customers asked on their bags or traysThen you got ~$1000 per month for this shit!!
This is the easiest cash grab system i ever saw, you should definitly try it.I gained more with this than gambling on those scam-currencies
a robot can do that for cheaper than $1000.
why would i invest time in a career, knowing that a $150 tin man made in china would replace me in a period of 5 years time or so?
Then get rich before that robot during the 5 years
nah.
people treat servers like shit.
let the robots handle it.
i hope they come equipped with tasers to fuck some people's shit up.
Maybe some stores will allow customers to bully the robots
well... better robots than people (especially if it's me).
