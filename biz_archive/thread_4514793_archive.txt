so did you guys listen when I posted about buying Bitshares?
My thread was empty as usual.
It got listed on Binance guys this will gain traction.
Bitshares is currenctly the BEST DEX out there and people will look into this.
Think about it, Bittrex delisted and poloniex problems with the wallet maybe because they find Bitshares a competitor.Regards.
The guy who recommended substratum many times already
I'd like it more if it didn't take me 50 tries to get my orders through on the exchange because of unconfirmed transactions or whatever
shhh shhhh just let the thread go empty again.
It always happens because pajeets only want to buy neo and ark
You dont need to shill your shitty dex, cryptoyoda already does that for you
How do I transfer my BTS from Binance to OpenLedger?
I've asked this on the damn BTS forum and can't get an answer
I posted about bitshares alot also :plast post i made LOL they never listen !
ZEPH Zephyr is the better buy right now.
For every 10% BitShares goes up, ZEPH will go up 100%.
They'll both succeed together, but ZEPH has much more room to multiply.
