If your shitcoin hasn't "mooned" yet it means the market doesn't give a shit about it.
You're retarded.We're all gambling on shitcoin futures like that guy who put his BTC on Segwit futures.
Only hype and pnd's dictate what goes up or down.The coins that are actually getting used and already has a function are on top 25.
We put our money on the highest risk which will also give the highest reward if they are successful
The coins that are actually getting used and already has a function are on top 25so why is OMG which has 0 irl function atm number 14?, that measure only applies to shitcoins and pnds my friend.
