how aggressive are these muthafuckers?
req still under ico pricenot aggressive enough apparently
big these coming this Friday.For those that accumulated the last 3 weeks, you will be rewarded.The combined market capitalization of YC companies was over $80 billion.
But do we truly know the level of involvement with the REQ team?They could have simply given them a cheque for a few grand and asked for some tokens..
Their github looks quite shit desu
Very aggressive.
Biggest swinging dicks in crypto
it's not public yet senpai.look at the github of their former company which they pivoted from.https://github.com/Moneytisthese mofo know how to code javascript unlike the LINK solo dev and Sergey with 1 line commit.
They gave them $120k and the network connections.Don't be surprised if in 1-2yrs you see a Request button on AirBnB or Uber...
