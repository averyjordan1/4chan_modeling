>have a authenticator for wallets and various coin market accountsWhat do I do in case my phone craps out on me?
Any precautionary steps?
write down the restore code
if you didn't do that then get another device put authenticator on it and login to coinbase on a computer you can re setup the 2fa and it will give you another code
