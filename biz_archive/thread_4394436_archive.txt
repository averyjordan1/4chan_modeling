Okay, tell us everything, we're all gonna be alright.
How much did you lose when you fell for the XRP meme by chasing a retarded pump?
made 5k in 5 minutes
I'm fucking retarded.... Why the fuck did I buy
It's okay ripples, at least you didn't buy BCH at 0.4
Okay, I only lost $300.
I learned my lesson, but I heard about other guy losing fucking 14k.
Just hold....
The longterm worth of an advance like this is much more than what you would've gotten from the pump.
We are the ripple marines and we’re NOT FUCKING SELLING
what do you mean ?
it's up 17% for me since yesterday
Glad I sold, still dumpin hard.
Might buy back in at 3k
