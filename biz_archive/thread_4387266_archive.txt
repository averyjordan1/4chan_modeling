they already said no
Mmm.
Not good.
Noooot good.
Why is this allowed?
They're just going to keep the BTG and sell it to enrich themselves?
its pretty common knowledge to have your btc off an exchange in order to guarantee you will get the forked coins.
the exchanges also let us know ahead of time in order for us to prepare.
its no ones fault but your own
Yepwhat do you think they do with the Gas your neo is generating?
they sell to poloniex
I dont like what I'm reading right now.
thanks for the 800$ coins goy
why the fuck did they lock our btc then
they sell it on their own exchange that's what they do with their fee coins too they just dump them once a month and the markets take a hit you can even google about that there's proof
Sold my BTG on Binance for $600.
Get fucked trex fags.
wtf, source?
I remember they said they will
allowed?
who is going to stop them?
if you want control of your btc and all its potential forks, keep it in your own wallet.
