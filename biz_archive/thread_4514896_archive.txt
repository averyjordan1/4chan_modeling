Guys.
Ive had enough.The justing never stopped, and I see now It never will.
I went 3 months without a single losing day doing daytrading and in the end I lost 75% in several foul trades spanning a week.Im taking the last 10k out from my saving account and going all in on dividend paying stocks.
Hopefully in 5 years I can leave this Neet hell
Dividend stocks don't even pay for themselves until far longer than 5 years.
this unfortunately.dividend stocks are good for being comfy in retirement or mid life, not moon missions
daytrading cryptooh boy
k on dividend stocks right before the great 2018 recession?
Just wait until things slide for a few months to a year and then go in.
Save up until then.
bro I was seriously making 250 a week, I didnt have to workthen I fucking lost it all margin trading god dammit Im never using leverage again
Noobs should never use margin, leave that for market makers and experienced traders
well I thought I was good because of my fantastic winning streak.
let that be a lesson to everyone
Nope, it won't be a lesson for anyone but you.
