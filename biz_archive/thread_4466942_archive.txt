Chainlink is a scam and doesn't solve the oracle problem, actually a solution to the oracle problem is a paradox and can't exist and if it does then it pretty much guarantees massive fraud.
I read a study about it which was published by the MIT and peer reviewed, also reminds me of the work of Dr. Braun (or whatever he is called)Kinda feel bad for the dumb people holding this coin and thinking the oracle problem was solved by some stuttering fat weed addict who won some special ed price at SIBOS last year.
???
?Is this supposed to be funny
Its the truth actually and the funny part is that people buy into the chainlink scam.Also even if Chainlink would work as they say it woud actually open up MASSIVE fraud opportunities.Thats why its not gonna happen anytime soon.
Link the study of forever know your FUD is useless
published by the MIT>by the MIT>the MIT
the oracle problem was unsolvablethen the blockchain came along.
I love the chain link shitposting as much as the next holder but honestly this post is complete shit tier OP
There's an interesting comparison of Oracle Solutions here: https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/progress_reports/november_2017.md
The price is not low enough, gotta FUD more
