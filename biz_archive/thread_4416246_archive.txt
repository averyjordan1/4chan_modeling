So what happens if the US loses net neutrality next month?
Couldn't that have a huge effect on the cryptomarkets?Is would make it really easy to block privacy coins like XMR and ZEC, as well as Tor and VPNs.Why aren't people freaking out more?
why would comcast give a shit about privacy coins?
much more likely that through the "net neutrality" rules the government would make those things illegal.
How exactly are they going to block something that is encrypted end to end?
All they see is random data.
Brainlet here.
Is there any feasible way of blocking cryptocurrencies and their ecosystems?

Yes, ISPs can easily block crypto traffic.
The loss of net neutrality is a huge threat to the whole system.
