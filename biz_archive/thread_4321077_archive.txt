Got 10k of these fuckers in the airdrop, what do I do with them now?
Can't find shit searching, no mentions at all, any idea when something will happen with it?
Dump them.
Airdrops are a way for pajeets to create a market for shitcoins on etherdelta.
Then they dump their premine and move on.
kek, already dumped at 7x
how much is 1 eark?
where is it listed?
you can send them to me
fuck is eARKwhy should i care i own 2100 ARK
Where did you sell and for what price ?
4321102>dumping for a grand total of like 3 cents Might as well wait and hope it does something.4321205Some guy was airdropping 10k here a pair of days ago, haven't got a fucking clue what it is, but the address is 0xf834faa2b38e807e7cf05e35b799a151c8ccd35f and with that you can trade it on ED (for something like 0.000003ETH/eARK).
Bump.
I also would like to know what this thing is supposed to do.
im not seeing in on Etherdelta, then again that exchange is nightmare.
I never got mine.
I got 100k Eark.
Its ark on the ERC 20 blockchain
it would please me greatly if the value of eARK ever reached the value of ARK lol






It will quickly overtake that of ark.
Soon each Eark will be worth 300 dollars.
