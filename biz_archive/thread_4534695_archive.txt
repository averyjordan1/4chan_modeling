Hello, I am in the process of starting my own business from nothing but a laptop, data connection and living in my car.
I have very little experience in business, but am fairly competent with technology.
I would love any pointers or pushes in the right direction, so far I have been buying food, fuel and paying my phone bill with money generated from mass spamming adult xyz links and adfly links on all fronts of mainstream social media.
Does anyone have any tips to make at least a comfortable living via online self ran methods?
Would love any /biz/ approved guides, tips or layouts on affiliate marketing, dropshipping, SEO or anything really I could do with what I have.
Not looking for anyone to tell me to get a real job, I could easily go back to welding but I am sick of working for people, and want to run my own business.
Any advice relating to business creation or money making methods would be gold.
Better act quick lmao, with NN going away, online startups are no longer going to be viable.
seriously?
well i better look into this then
what about it would make online business no longer viable?
I'm reading now about it, but so far I gather it just prevents service providers from having too much power.
I know that's probably just what they want people to think though.
I'm not too informed at all on law or politics currently.
been living in my vehicle on the road like a vagabond after all
i know im talking to myself now cause everyone here is a cryptocurrency jew, but will big business really kill online entrepreneur opportunities if NN is revoked?
what is NN?
