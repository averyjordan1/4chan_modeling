Why aren't you buying this shit ?
Because I'm buying the non-chink superior exchange coin instead of a shitty scam kuckoin
Because Coss is better
Its good project, but with their exchange current volume, i see this token really overvalued
bought before the pump.
Supercomfy hold
4253202Literally thisSup anons
4253153Man when will you learn about the chinks ?
Wasn't missing Antshares, WTC and ETP enough ?
Wanna miss another china moon shot ?
Whatever I did my part I don't even need to shill this shit my mind is at peace with this thread I made on /biz/ before it join BNB price.
Yeah OK you're still holding onto COSS.
Well, whatever floats your boat but don't pink wojak this board when you realize you're in a big slow PnD.
COSS is a better buy and is an active accumulation mode.
Kucoin is good but I already cashed out $0.90.
COSS has 10x+ to go before Kucoin is attractive again.
Can someone send me a coss slack invite?
I didn't find a working one.
