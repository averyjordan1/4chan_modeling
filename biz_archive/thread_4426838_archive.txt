this meme needs to die already
BOOHOO, only a x2 instead of a x3, you POOR SOULLLL.
Hello newfriend!
There used to be combo-posting when different posters try to each say successive words from "Just fuck my shit up" and which goes back to our Brendan's divorce.The meme IS dying, which is why its now reduced to only "JUST".
It's got new life here on /biz/ because out denizens keep fucking right up by buying low and selling high.
JUST!
That's not the /biz/ way
