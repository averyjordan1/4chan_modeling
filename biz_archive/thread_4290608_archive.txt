What actually stops a person from buying tons of stocks at around 150$ each and just waiting for the next Apple or Bitcoin 2009 early adopters?Find a ton of new companies with a chance of going big and just invest in them.I tried this in some vidya game and got really rich.Shouldn't it work?
you need money, and what if the majority of your investments go to bags?
for every apple or bitcoin you invest in there are literally 100 other failures.if you diversify like that you just end up getting the market rate of return, its a statistical thing
wait, it doesnt make sence.
better invest all in one

Second stocks thread that I saw on /biz/ today.Reported for off topic
Companies making AI and Machine AI learning.Check Two Minute Papers videos if you're interested.I remember just months ago getting interested in AI and the turning point because of a video game so I searched AI news and there was barely any news.
Then Google came with their Deepmind, then the AI by Tesla defeated one of the best players at DOTA.

Just put one bitcoin on any brand new shitcoinWould be the same
