I'm a member of the espers discord.
Every other day someone brings up the shitty devs and the mod team goes crazy.Coins dead

Yobit killed Pajeet coin by refusing to migrate to new chain.
Now it has an even shittier name, "Espers2", which screams shitcoin.
sirs it only 1 satoshiprice can only go up from herebuy now.good investrape u next week
Does yobit have dice?
Maybe someone is gambling with their bags and tobit has to buy in order to pay them?
This is actually a good theory.
Never thought about their reserves for that.
Why do you ask such question?
Espers is best coin now.
Second only to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
You can buy on Yobit cheaper than elsewhere.
Do the needful!
