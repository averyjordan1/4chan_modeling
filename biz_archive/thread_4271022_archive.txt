Lemme shill you something:Perhaps you faggots didnt notice but Raiden got listed on Binance.They did a silent ICO without hype, so the hype is starting now!Yes this is a collective FOMO but isince lots of people dont eaven know about this ICO (or the fact that you can buy it on a normie exchange) the "network FOMO effect" is going to be huge.Why do you think Binance added it the moment it hit Etherdelta?Because they knew the crazy volume it would bring.
93 million market cap its already too late and up 100% I aint buying
bwah 93mil is nothing for this hype-making machine.....do as you want anon....
Fuck it, all in.
volume's increasing quickly.
i'm all in too.
This is a hugely important project, but I feel that there is some drama surrounding it in the Ethereum community, so I would wait for the dust to settle before investing.
