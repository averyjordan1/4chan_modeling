So when do you sleep?
When do we get to sleep?
Sleep comfy as hell every night, since I'm 100% stock
Stocks will continue to rise steadily and safely as they have since 2009, with only minor corrections, and this will never end, reverse, or be upset in any way.
You sleep well sweetie, and dream of those 5% annual gains.
