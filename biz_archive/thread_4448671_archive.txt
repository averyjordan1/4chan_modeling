Are you not using your inflated bitcoin to buy ETH?
That'd be great.
Already sold a bit chunk of my trading stash.
Bring on the sale.
I'm using ETH to hold value while I wait for the pendulum to swing between BTC and BCH.Working like a charm.
I think I'm gonna go straight into BCH if it starts dumping fast enough tho
Yep fuck it I'm doing it now.
