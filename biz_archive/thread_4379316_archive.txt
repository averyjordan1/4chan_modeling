Literally right at the bottom.

I sold 1250 of my ODN for 71 VTC for a buy-in at 60k, am I retarded?
you must be a newfag, any time any crypto asshole goes on camera the currency pops
chainlink
you're retarded for needing to clarify thisyou sold ODN which is a winyou bought VTC which is a win
Implying implications that ODN isn't a long HODL?
i-is it breaking through?
