>/biz/ calls people dumping at 1.5-2x post-ICO "Pajeets">these "Pajeets" are doing steady 2x gains several times a year or even a month>those quick $10k they made from a $5k investment are now free to be invested in the next ICO instead of bagholding for years like /biz/>they'll rinse and repeat this process 10x in the time it takes /biz/'s bags to go 3xHmmm...
ICOs dont do 2x anymore.There are literally multiple ICOs every day all raising 15-30+million, there isn't enough money in the system for them to get pumped anymore like they were in the spring/summer when you could easily flip ICOs
It only really works like that if you have the capital to start with, either an early adopter or old money so that you can weather a few losses.
Pajeets aren't going from rags to riches with their 150 Authorship tokens, and the ones that do are 1:10000.
