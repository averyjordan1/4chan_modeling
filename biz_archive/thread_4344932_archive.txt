A diamond ring is just an apology to your fiance that shes marrying you instead of chad thundercock.Thinkin of telling my girl to just take moissanite for social appearance.
Thoughts?
I bought my cute wife (male) a cock ring for our engagement.
She (he) appreciates it very much and we use it a lot.
It's a pretty ring we can share!
I was thinking on giving a moissanite too, bitch wont even know its not a real diamond, and looks 10x better than a real diamond.
Agree except I think it's just a cashgrab from de Beers and the diamond jews.I told my girl she's not getting one unless I hit billions.
paying thousands for a rock that has 0 valueTry selling that thing the second after you bought it if you don't believe me.
Diamonds are the biggest scam in modern history.
Social appearance?
Who the fuck cares.
You cannot do anything with the money you spend on social appearance.
You might as well dump a load of cash into the river
