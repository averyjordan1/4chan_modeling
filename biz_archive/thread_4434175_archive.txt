I am literally laughing out loud due to the fact that, somehow, my completely fictitious FUD was replied to by Rory.
Original post:My wife's friend's husband knows one of the developers who've been brought onboard by SmartContract.com after the ICO, and he told me something about ChainLink:>it's a scamThey're basically just using the LINK ICO to fund development of a completely different platform using a non-proprietary analogue of that new "hashgraph" scheme (better than traditional "blockchain"), and they intend to dump their "reserved" tokens whenever the market and their situation dictates.
He told me that the LINK tokens were intended to mislead competitors while incidentally sandbagging whales, but that they will be somehow either convertible to or redeemable for the *real* token, but that the value will continue to tank and never go above $0.25.>get out nowHe also says Rory is a useless cunt, very salty in person.
