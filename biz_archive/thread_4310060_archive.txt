It was in my Margin Wallet.Why??
use a trezor
Probably got liquidated without you notice.
Go check your email or trade history
Maybe cus youre a nigger?
why do you keep it on the exchange anywayyou're begging to lose your money
I received that email:"Position nearing liquidationYour position is nearing liquidation.
Your maintenance margin has been reduced to 22.5% or less."WTF???
My iotas is not safe??
Not "my iotas", iotas you borrowed.
That's what margin is.
Did you get a liquidation email or not?
That's nearing liquidation.Of course it's not safe.
If it's in margin wallet, those are your collateral.
The funding wallet is safe?
Yes, i received that email some days ago, but now my wallet has zero iota.
By "funding wallet" I assume you mean the coins you came to the exchange with?
They are collateral on the value of the borrowed coins.
They're sold to prevent a loss for the lender.
check your trade history to see what happen to your iotas.
Should be a force sell if you were longing those iotas.
