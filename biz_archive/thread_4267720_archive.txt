I've no idea what do to now really, I'm expecting BTC to dump more soon enough and most alts seem too high but I'm in the mood for scalping something.
What shitcoin should I pick?Pic unrelated
Buy the ARK dip, buy NEO now.
You're really bad if you didn't buy when the altcoins was low.
You're a bit in a fucky situation because you missed out on that opportunity now that btc WILL dump, trust me it will don't be delusional like other people.
Won't recommend REQ EVX POWR right now unfortunatly because I don't want to be buying into a pump.
Am expecting the same from BTC.
But the markets usually do thing the opposite of what I expct.
Thanks, I haven't been at the top of my game lately.
Change from hourly to daily chart and zoom out.
Buy whatever you want, as long is it is not BTC.
Then go buy Lambo.
Enjoy
