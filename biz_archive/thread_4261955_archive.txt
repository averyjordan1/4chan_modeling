Any anons holding this?
Why is it never spoken about?
Is this kmart?
Anon, I have some news for you...
It's Koreâ€¦ and no one seems to care about it.
I am bag holding it from 0016000 after the first alt crash.
Its been a fucking pain in the ass even after the new wallet has been shipped out the price hasn't been moving.
100% if it rises back up I'm dumping my bags hard.
Seems like a decent coin.
Just never seem to hear anything of it?

Not interested in investing in your shitty store, Fritz.
Go play tractor simulator or something.
