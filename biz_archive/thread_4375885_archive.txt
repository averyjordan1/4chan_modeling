I just found this huge BCH buywall and sent it to a buddy via whatsapp.
Then I wanted to take a screenshot for /biz/ and now it's gone.What the actual fuck is going on guys?A 10.000BTC buywall for BCH?
Which is now hidden?
It's not hidden whoever set it pulled it
it means you have to buy btc.
the buy order is back.
watch it for yourself.
better
you know one can easily cancel a order, didn't you?
It's called being a big dick player and not literal plankton
