>BCH is coming back to normal>BTC mooningI told all of you fucking flippening fags that this was a pump and dump scheme, but none of you listened, I got BTC at a bargain price and now I can hold with comfort.
The king returns.
I was genuinely concerned we wouldn't get any more cheap BTC for a while.
We should be thanking these retards man; I stocked up on 4 more during this shitshow.
Wish I bought more, I just kept my holdings and sat this shitshow out
I'll probably end up stocking up on BCH when it stabilizes so whenever some korean tries this shit again, I can make a fucking fortune.
Same, I was hoping it would dip further so saved some fiat ready, but nevermind.
Good thinking, what price do you have in mind?
Accumulated more at $5500 .
Thanks cashies!
