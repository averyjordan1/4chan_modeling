Does anyone in here do any kind of sales?
What kind of commission do you get?
I work for a small diagnostics company, and I was hired as a business development manager with a relatively high salary (unlike our sales people).
However, my job has evolved into selling a particular product overseas.
I am the only person at our company getting this product sold.
However, when I was hired, I was not offered any kind of commission, because it wasn't foreseen that I would be making sales at this point yet.Now, I have a really large sale that could happen within a few months, and I want to try to negotiate a commission.
Previously, my boss said "well, you have a high base salary, and our sales people are paid a very low salary with their commissions."
Is there any logical way to navigate this situation?
If so, what kind of commission should I ask for?
I've heard that frequent sales of an average of $10,000 usually warrant a ~15% commission, while in the hundreds of thousands of dollars would get around 5%.
Is this true?
I work in software sales, we get an 11% commission with bonus multipliers after meeting quota.
Typical deals are in the 80 - 200K range with potential for deals up to $2M.

What's your salary and what's how much is the potential sale worth?
Currently I only make $11 per hour but I make nearly 50% gross in commission.
You ain't gonna get anywhere near that

my salary is $100k.
The potential sale I'm talking about is $15 million.
