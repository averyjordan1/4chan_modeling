please any amount will be helpful14RT7d7RsArM6U4W5bc1Y8ZcPjEh3iSL5v
And how would they know who's going to blockchain.info?
It's not like the IPs are public or anything.
Only the owners can know that.
Do you know how big the traffic is?
I would be impossible to know who's doing what unless you do a really careful research.
And again, only the owners of the site can have access to that info.That first, second, you can't do jack shit with the IP address of someone unless they're running Windows 98 and connected to the internet directly through a 1997 modem.

Just because you cant figure it out doesnt mean its not MaliciousVery retarded thoughta lot of people larp here and I've seen real people giving money away.
Their reasons?
Who the fuck knowsMy only guess would be expecting a retard to post their private key instead of public key because they are in a hurry to get money and they get fucked up.But you have 0 proof to say this is a scam.
I reckon it's shady but how can you say it's a scam if you literally don't know how "they" are operating?
Going by your logic any thread is a scam because why is people posting?
What's the purpose?
they must be doing something evil.Try to find out WHY they do it before you call it a scam.
That way you won't be a total retard.

I'm not defending them retard.
I already said this is shady as fuck.
But I've also seen people giving money for real here so why the fuck not?
Maybe I'm not a technologically impaired soyboy like you and I know posting my address won't do any harm.
SPECIALLY if it's a wallet where I don't have any money.
Because you know, that's kind of how crypto works.
What you said so far is nonsense ("they get your ip from the blockchain" what the fuck man) and your argument is "I don't understand this, but it must be a scam".
It's stupid.Go ahead and keep thinking you can get hacked through your IP and public key.
At least people who post here understand how the system works and they're not scared like cucks to post their shit.
Is it giveaway day on biz?

If you're just going to spread bullshit lies that someone once told you, then you shouldn't be trying to "help" people in the first place.

You just CAN'T INSTALL A KEYLOGGER if you only have the IP of the target.
You can't.
Period.
It's literally impossible.
Unless you are the NSA/CIA it's just impossible.
And even if you could, which again is impossible, visiting blockchain.info won't give your info to anyone in any way.You don't understand shit about computers.People who get hacked with keyloggers are retarded because they download files or visit weird websites that execute the code.
Here you are saying that you get infected by visiting the cert signed blockchain.info?
Are you saying they're compromised?
They are hacked?
They are the ones stealing money?

There are multiple reasons someone would make these threads.The most logical answer is trolls trying to waste your time.Maybe someone just wants to see how much money a typical /biz/tards has in crypto.And finally, could just be LARP, lots of people LARP on here for different reasons.

These threads are a group of malicious hackersJust look at the wording, and the fact we have 20 of these threads everyday with the exact same shit.
How oblivious do you need to be to think this is your typical "neet larp"
Can't find the the 4btc transaction either that one of the first posters uploaded as proofs.
I'm guess he's hoping to get someone's private key by accident?
They love the attention of getting replies, you underestimate how lonely some are.
Maybe someone just wants to see how much money a typical /biz/tards has in crypto.>LARPingThese are the only reasons that make sense to me.
I posted my address though.
Never underestimate the ability of 4chaners to do things the rest of society would find irrational.

Don't be naiveYou're the one being naive thinking they have the power to hack someone's computer by only having their IP address (assuming they are able to get even that).Exactly, that's why I'm telling this guy there's no way you lose by posting in this thread.
Worst case you gain nothing and lost 10 seconds of your time.
This place actually does have moderators.
Sure they let everything slide but I find it hard to believe they would allow this to become a scam website.
lets hope this day OP is not a faggot15b1z4qGJdcCzk9ru4y2jVDgMe9xdaCDEg
lolso you are saying the biggest blockchain website was hacked and they're getting our IP addresses from there.
Okay.
So what's next?
What's the next step of their master plan?
Go learn IT security.
You can't do anything with the IP of someone.Just look at the wording, and the fact we have 20 of these threads everyday with the exact same shit.
How oblivious do you need to be to think this is your typical "neet larp"You are so retarded man.
Come on.
We already gave you a better alternative.
Not super secret hacker group.
Maybe it's just one guy trying to get private keys posted by mistake.Maybe it's just datamining.
Malicious?
I don't know.
Can they get your money or do YOU any harm?
Nope.Please go learn a little bit about computers and the blockchain, because it seems your only experience lies within "being here since the beginning" and 4chan experience hasn't given you any worthy knowledge.
Good luck putting that get on the IRS listing every trade.
At least E*TRADE you can export easily
lol ok, you are part of OPs group, this is now certain.LOL

4451781The entire reason they are called "public keys" is that you can post them anywhere with no consequencesThere are a variety of blockchain explorer sites and all the common ones are not backdoored by scammers on /biz/, if they were they would be able to take millions from people using them without needing to generate more traffic from 4chan... the only way this works is if you follow a link posted to some phishing site pretending to be a blockchain explorer.
So, as with always, don't click links, and never put information into a site you didn't navigate to yourself
bro its reasonable to wonder why they are posted when very obviously close to zero btc is ever given away but you really don't understand blockchain tech or cryptography in general really if you think these threads give anyone any vector at all into taking money
