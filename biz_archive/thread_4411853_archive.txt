do you think BTC will dip this year, even if just for a short time?
I think bch will flip btc by eoy
btc is mooning because of tether scam.
so as long this scam keeps on going i doubt it
when btc dips, it's game over.
before it had development on going and people thought it's going to be the next peer 2 peer cash system.
Now as Blockstream fucked it up it's only popular because it increases in value.
One more bear market and bitcoin will be replaced.
You better hope it never dips again.
The hodlers are now idiots without ideals.
It's not going to dip.
For the sake of the cryptocurrency market it is too big to fail at this point.
BTC goes down and we all lose our money.
Flipping is going to happen with BTC dipping.
Buy no or buy at $10k.
The decision is yours
Its leading up to its final ath before crashing anf flipping with BCH
