Buy QTUM if you like money.
It has found new levels of support every day for a week now, we're up about ~40% in a week.
This is looking to break out into ATHs any day now.
The trading volume goes higher on bithumb everyday.
QTUM also getting pair listings with NEO and other coins.
At about ~$14.50 now, can realistically expect $20+ within a few days
Is it the next moon mission?
I bought in at $11, sold at $14.40.
Should I be looking to get back in?
I bought around ~$10 and am still holding, have made a few swing trades the last few days but not selling off any of my original positionI sincerely expect $20+ in the coming days, a lot of hype starting to form behind QTUM, way more volume by the koreans (and presumably chinese) on bithumb over the last 7-10 days and there's no sign of slowing down.
Just look at the charts over the week, we went from $10-15 or so, finding strong support all the way.
Volume isn't increasing
