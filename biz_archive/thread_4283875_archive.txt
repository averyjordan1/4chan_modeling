let's be honest biz, all the btc fudders or "wish it to fail" are deep down just want to accumulate more as much as possible.
When you say BCH is replacing BTC you know you are lying and you feel a little bit shame to the KING, right anon?
Fuck off Core shill, and enjoy your $40 transaction fees.

You getting nervous corecuck?
shill bn cap coin>on 4chanchan
When BCH and BTC reach parity they should just merge and continue with BCH code base.
Core devs should obviously be banned from the git repo.
