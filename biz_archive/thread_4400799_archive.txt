EU fag here...So...
Since BTC has mooned and all...
When do you think its gonna dip again?It seems to me that when bitcoin dips... All the altcoins dip too...
There was a big ass dip just a couple of days ago idiot.
I know!!
But they seem to be sistematic, just trying to figure out the next correction faggot
Euro is 1/10 of the market
Just trying to get a grasp of the next correction...Before xmas?
Maybe???
ive got fiat waiting on kraken for the next time jihan and co try one of their megapumps, not sure when exactly but it will happen.
It's not gonna dip again til it hits $10k
Next dip is on Thanksgiving (1 week from now)
