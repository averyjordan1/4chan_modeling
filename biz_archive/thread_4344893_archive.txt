Understand that Bitcoin Cash will reach .3 tonight.
Make Bitcoin great again!
yeah it is awfully /interesting/ that it it's hitting that wall at 2.1, I assumed we're just hitting some people scared the fork would make it crash, causing it to crash.
but that safety net means somethings up.
Soon
FUDDERS BLOW THE FUCK OUT.
Nope, .3 is nothing, we're going to .5 this time.
Bought $1000 more btc today and put it straight into bch, riding the waves for profit, feelsgoodman

Having to buy BCH>Not having it from the fork in August.Comfy
Two months ago it was at .6 and nothing happened.
you mean .5 OP
MINERS ARE SWITCHING BACK TO BCH, I REPEAT, MINERS ARE SWITCHING BACK TO BCHhttps://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions
what the fuck are you talking about?
Satoshi nakamoto gave github access ONLY to gavin andersen and appointed him as the lead dev back in the early days, gavin was so fucking stupid he gave access to blockstream devs and they kicked him out claiming his account was hacked and never let him in again, that's how low those corecucks are, both BTC and BCH are centralized and serve their own perspective agendas.
Its dead jim
Does the hash rate even matter at this point?
Anyone who wanted out of btc is already out, and anyone who wanted in to bch is already holding.Are there any new bch buyers?
If not, the price will stay right where it is.
gajillion unconfirmed transactions for btc.. hard fork incoming.
Jiyyyaahhhhhhaaan always wins baby
