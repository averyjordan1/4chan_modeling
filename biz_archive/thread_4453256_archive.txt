Remember the old times when BTC and Alts went hand-in-hand?
When BTC went horizontal for weeks-months?
Yes.
I remember it like it was yesterday.
I was out in the club going hard with some dime bitches when Bitcoin hit 4k.
I think it was a Saturday.
I ended up buying like 4 bottles to celebrate, even though I didn't even hold any Bitcoin I was still getting fucking rich off my alts.Now, I die inside every time Bitcoin pumps because it's bleeding alts dry.
All I can say is fuck Bitcoin and fuck Bitfinex and Tether for this bogus unnatural pump of this shitcoin.
They killed crypto.
Exchanges need to stop pricing alts against bitcoin, or this will not stop happening.
Also the normie FOMO money
I remember.
I-it was just th-throw away money...
it's bleeding alts dryTotal market cap rises with bitcoin
The only thing that rises is Bitcoin
Remember when the only people fudding BTC were nocoiners?
Now we have cashies.
