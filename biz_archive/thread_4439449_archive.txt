anyone else catch that insider's thread yesterday?
anon gave pretty solid evidence that MOD is collaborating with NEO to enter chinese market tracking shipments.
a MOD board of directors guy is presenting with Da Hongfei in Shanghei.
Partnership to be announced around the 21st.
can't find the thread now if an anon remembers and can link it?
As a holder of over 30k Mod I would love the sauce on this
hope an anon will come forward with link, having trouble finding in archive.
but also hardly anyone responded to the thread and it disappeared quickly.
