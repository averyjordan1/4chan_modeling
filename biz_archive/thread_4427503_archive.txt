I've found a way to get our revenge on the poos, /biz/.
>go to Omegle's chat section>pretend to be female>you will eventually come across an indian male, the site is swarming with them>after chatting and flirting with them for a bit, reveal that you're a semi-famous and rich actress (take your pick - I use Anna Kendrick)>they fall for it, not even kidding>tell them that you'll pay for their ticket to come see them but they need to pay a $30 fee for the plane reservation>collect rakeshbux and move on
>harassing innocent peopleZzzzzZZZzzz
No subhuman is innocent, merely being alive and lowering the world's IQ is a grave sin.

I made all that up, I actually haven't done itBut it could work The post sounded funnier in my head, now I just feel bad
 /hug
What do you think all those bots are doing?
this, they aren't the same people who have turned our board into a designated shitting street.
After all there's like a bazillion Pajeets what are the odds that the one you match on Omegle is also posting discords on /biz/?
Pretty slim to nil.I think our best bet is just continuing the casual racism against them on this board.On the other hand, those thirsty fucks are ruining it for the rest of us.
And I'm not even talking about getting laid, I mean just - there's a great opportunity to speak to someone form a totally different country and have a connected world and they're just shitting it up with their incessant desire to jerk off to a girl on kik.To err is human.
Take that guilt and transmogrify it into the desire and drive to get Lambo rich anon.
