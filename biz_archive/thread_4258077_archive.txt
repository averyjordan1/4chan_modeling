No ripplers are going to be in for a rude shock by 2018 Q1
supply>market capThis piece of shit needs eight BILLION dollars just to double in price.
I can't imagine why anyone with a brain would ever put a cent into this piece of shit.
My favorite is when some clueless /biz/let says that it's only at twenty cents and has a lot of room to grow.
Truly the dumbest of the dumb inhabit this board.
Ripple (the company) keeps dumping the tokens, keeping the price low.
Also, they sell tokens directly to their clients (mostly exchanges), at a lower price.
It is literally the shittiest investment you could possibly make.
If you wanna go to the moon, buy adt.
low price, small amount of tokens, actual product, low volume on bittrex (price will go up no matter what).
ripple has too many tokens... the price will never move and may actually keep going down forever.
What's going to happen Q1?
Not how market cap works.
Because it sucks
We're hitting $2
Nothing

First off, that is NOT how market cap works.
Second, Ripple speaks to an industry that is worth TRILLIONS of dollars.>Truly the dumbest of the dumb inhabit this boardWere you talking about yourself?
