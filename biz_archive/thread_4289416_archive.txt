Is this the opposite of the 10,000 btc transaction?
5.28 USD feeAh..ahahaha.
I dun get it
I withdrew from Gemini and they paid a $9.50 fee to send just so sit could arrive within 30 minutes.This is truly the future.
$1.41 sent dollar sending fee
coinbase are fucking jews.I use it to buy my BTC and send it to Kraken and Binance for my shitcoins.
Are you meming or are you actually a retard.
No-coiner here: why can't you send directly from your address to another and skip the middleman?
Why do you need to use services like coinbase?
Why can't I pound this nail with this screwdriver?
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR NOT BACKING THE SEGWIT SOFT FORK YOU FAGGOTS
And how does one aquire bitcoin without buying from a site such as coinbase?
It's not coinbase that charges the network fee that $5.28 is to the bitcoin network.
To send across the blockchain
Acquire.
Fuck
Holy shit this technology is never going to take off.
Who would pay that fee every time you buy something?
you can support cartel money laundering by sending money to columbia through western unionORyou can use jewbase which will literally steal any money they can.
They've probably stolen over 1m
It's network fees.
Try sending bitcoin to bitcoin and you're going to have to pay that fee as well this was just to put it in perspective Normies would understand.
Got to a Bitcoin atm where you deposit cash for btc.
Fees are around 8-10%
