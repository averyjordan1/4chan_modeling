People always cash out for weekends.

>bought in at 850Well I'm feeling good.
Was debating it, glad I did it.
NOt a shitcoin then...is it
Have you just entered crypto last week?
BTC always dips on weekends faggot, whether the market is bearish or bullish.
welp that was it for bch seems like the top is in hope you sold
it's definitely not going above .15 or $1,000
$900 with no big announcements, what do you think is going to happen when the announcements of full support start occurring tomorrow and over the next 2 weeks.These big bitcoin companies are already quietly telling their staff to go buy BCH before they announce, obviously.Anyone who isn't mildly dyslexic has noticed something big is happening behind the scenes.
You dead nIGGA.
I bought at 353
