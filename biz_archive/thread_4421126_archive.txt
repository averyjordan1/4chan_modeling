Hi, are there any professional blockchain developers here?
I was able to convince a large company that I am an experienced Solidity developer and that they need to hire me.
What is a reasonable salary I should be asking for?
A bitbean.
whatever it is, ask in bitbean
$80-200k yearly salary for any software engineering gig based on years experience.
demand they pay you at least one LINK a month
Probably $60k minimum depending on your location.
How much do you think you deserve and how much does the company require your services?
There are likely few/no other solidity devs in the area so if they need you badly, you can ask for a more.
But they'll likely want to start you off small and you'll be able to work your way up to $80-100k if they still have demand as it's such a unique skill.
I'd ask for $60k.
Not a developer though.
My solidity experience is following the examples on the main ethereum website lol
