Can someone give me the rundown as to why this coin holds value?
is there any kind of dividend, like GAS from NEO?
0 value, they’ll just create more to pay those that produce electricity
*stores your value*
nothing more then chainlink coin 2.0
its absolute shit, but its the fomo flavour of the week
xD this hype is based on AIR not sun :D
SPARKZ is the GAS of POWR
No working product until 2019.
Sell your bags now.
This.
I've seen this kind of behaviour many, many times during the last year.
I would sell now.
chainlink at moment
I’ve studied the coin and not found any point in the token.They even had to address what the point of it was in a blog post because the reason for the token was so obscure, and even in the post the main reason was just capital raising.It’s pumping due to the idea and FOMO.
This is another district0x.
It will tank when people realize that the actual token has no value.
lol.
You're either utterly retarded or that's the worst FUD I've seen on Biz in weeks
Doesn't matter.
Even if the token is completely useless, if google launched one of those it would skyrocket.
This is crypto, everything is about hype.
Powerledger Sell Wall at moment... which to choose... link or ledger..... hmmm
I agree.
I have pointed out all of the reasons that this token has no actual value over the past two weeks.
I decided to ride the hype, bought on a dip yesterday and am counting my profits.
SeeIn a not too distant future you can buy electricity for your home with POWR at a lower cost than what your regular electricity company would charge.
Pun intended
Just wanted to be sure it didn't dump after the PBC hype.
Happy to be a part of this now!
It dumped hard for five minutes after PBC, then it got back up stronger and more consolidated
Yes.
I am now a POWR Ranger!
moron
