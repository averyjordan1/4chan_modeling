BTC going down to $4900 in ETA 6 hours.
After that, buy, it's NOT going to fall lower, it's a support level that has been tested multiple times in the past.
It's impossible to tell how high will it go after that, so buy the dip, anything above it might not come back for a very long time.
buy something that takes forever to transfer
Enjoy those bitcash bags anon
well you're waiting for the rise anyway, so it doesn't really matter if you have it or not, you're still going to be hodling.
crypto dont care about graphs you stupid monkeyits going back down to $1K and then 0
It's Chinese PayPal!
Blockchain will be unclogged in about 8 hours so the window for buying is really small.
After Blockchain regains liquidity, either nothing happens or BTC moons.Your best approach would be buying ETH and then buying BTC on an exchange for it.
ETH is considerably cheap right now.
You won't need to deal with the delays.
BTC literally went through the same pattern multiple times already, always perfectly.>Charts are pointless.Choose one.If anything, crypto is the easiest market to play because there are so many bots that it behaves EXACTLY like TA says.
it's a support levelLiterally words never spoken at business school when describing share trading.... Becuase they were just invented on 4chan.Fucking dipshits.
Literally words never spoken at business school when describing share tradingInteresting, went through business school in 1996 and support and resistance was considered the only reliable way of trading back then (or Ichimoku Cloud, for babies).
What are you on?
A degree in memes will make you more money than most colleges today.
Support levels were invented by 4chan.Ohhh my... throw your degree in the garbage right now, it's literally worthless.
