OH, what do we have here?
“Erc20 Token.”Hmm, let’s take a closer look:https://etherscan.io/token/0x55648de19836338549130b1af587f16bea46f66b?a=0xc892e9036e9a7bd657b65078829be18b6856a7911 PBL, Pebbles, Aka Publica token!Info:====================Publica is a decentralized publishing platform, so there is no censorship, lower costs to consumers, and all the proceeds go straight to the producer.
Producers can even run their own mini-ICOs for future projects.
Right now the focus is on books, and authors can even continue to be paid when books are re-sold since it's in the blockchain record.The ERC20 protocol will be used instead of the typical EULA licensing agreements.This would also allow people to lend and give books to friends, which current ebooks do not allow on platforms like Kindle, because the books are YOUR PROPERTY.CEO is Josef Marc, plenty to Google on him.
He led the launch of DirecTV and Verizon Fios, worked for Sony etc.
Big name.CTO owns Scandiweb (largest ecommerce service provider) with clients like Walmart, Reuters, NYT, Sephora, etc.~Under $5mil mcap~ICO brought in ~$1.4mil (.0002 pbl/eth price)~tokens were created less than 24 hours ago, so still early~17mil tokens in ciruclation, 34mil total"Gutenberg's Press Reinvented on the Blockchain"
