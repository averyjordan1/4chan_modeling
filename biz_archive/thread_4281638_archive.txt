Shut the fuck up if you havent accumulated yet dont fud so others cant get a piece of the pie.
Keep shilling ur retarded NULS and LINK...this is an actualy gem like confido... OP buy quick
How long did it take you to make that?I'll give it a look buddy
buy as much as you can afford of ADA.Leave for literally 2 years, go back to your life outside crypto.
Don't try to ride highs and lows to get more.
Just relax.
Try to get a gf, get a life.Come back and make more money than you will ever following /biz/ pajeet pnd scams.
I started here in June.
I bought about $30 of ANS before it was NEO and daytraded it up to about ~80 ANS/NEO.
When that hit $50 I was fucking stoked.
If i had of gone all in on ANS when I started I would have made 120k though.
Not making the same mistake and missing NULS this time though.
Have swung trade up to 1,120 NULS now.
This time I am making some decent gainz.
I know we are shilling NULS pretty hard m8, but it also happens to be a gem.
You should definitely be holding at least a little.

cheers, you too anon.
we're all gonna make it.
