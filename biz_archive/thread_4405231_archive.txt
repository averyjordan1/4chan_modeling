>muh swift partnership when will you faggots wake up and accept that this is a shitcoin
Never
I've seen so many brainlets defend this shitcoinS
When it's actually revealed to be a shitcoi,
You mean when it dips below ICO, starts a panic sell and gets delisted?
I have woken up, that's why I hold it.
Just bought 3k here, hopefully its enough for a dog by spring semester
more dummies who just don't get itand you know I understand why you don't get it.
most people these days can't even do simple math like percentages.
this coin is not for the brainlets.
it's for people who really understand what is going on in this space.a lot of people like to brag that they make money here without even knowing what a crypto is.
that's fine and dandy, but the downside to that is that you're gonna miss these types of gems.
Sure.
When that happens.
what do you expect it's high end market cap to be?
If it were to hit 1bil, then that's $1 a coin
do you understand the difference between circulating and total supply?
In 2 years time I would be very surprised if LINK's market cap was <$10 billion.
It's eaiser to fud if you don't understand the difference or ignore it.
wait , is it not on bittrex?
where can i buy this shit?
That sounded as bad as the rick and morty copy pasta that plebbit fag wrote.
“Well you see, to fully understand LINK you need a very high IQ...” Fuck you anon seriously... my hands are Iron still!
5k Link and not even stressing.
I am not even swing trading it.
I am just buying more with the profits from flipping my other alts.
HODL!
i accept.
i made a bad investment and lost all my starting cyrpto gains.
I won't sell cuz it's not even worth it to bother rn.
