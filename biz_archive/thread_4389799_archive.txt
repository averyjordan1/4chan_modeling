I refuse to go quietly into that good night.
I will never stop trying to improve my life.
By refreshing blockfolio all day and praying for my coin of choice to moon
By dropping out of college at 22 and put all my life saving in cryptos
did the same and have no living expenses and saved up cash but realise ill need a substation amount of dollars to secure land4390364Fuck brahs hope we make it just need one a few 10x's and were there!
I'm 20.
If I don't have $500k (enough to stop wagecucking) by the time I'm 30 I will kill myself.
I'll literally never work a day in my life.
I'd easily rather hang myself
