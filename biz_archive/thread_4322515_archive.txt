Wait for the difficulty to readjust
.5 hours.
How much are the fees?
I paid like $6 earlier.
Is that 20% of your Pajeet stack or soemthing?
Wait a second Lmfao.
People are complai about paying 600 sat fees?
It peeked around 1100 tho.
Thats like 0.06 cents haha
4322887https://estimatefee.com/Fees are almost 18 dollars for an hour long transaction time
Bitmex only lets me cash out if I pay 0.0089 BTC tx fee, that's 54$ wtf
Miners haven't moved yet.
They will if BCH keeps all the way down where it is
you stupid, it's 1100 sats per byte, for around 225 bytes per average transaction.Transactions with lots of inputs or outputs would cost up to $40But once BCH retargets in a few hours transactions should start to be cleared very quicklya month ago the mempool was basically empty, it will be empty again
