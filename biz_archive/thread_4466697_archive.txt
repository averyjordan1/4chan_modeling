Anyone else noticing how well BCH is holding on its own despite the pump on BTC?
This is the one lads, the bigger BTC gets the harder it will fall and you can bet BCH will be the first to have a wave of money pouring in from the sell off on BTC.
Start fucking accumulating, BCH will break new ATH's and you will want to be a part of it especially with BTC going down.
Meh.
Eth, Ada and Monero are doing the same thing, I don't keep track of other big coins.
It's holding because there are a million bag holders that don't want to sell at a loss.
Once i make it through alts, im going to buy a robot sexbot that looks like this minister satoshi bitch and im going to fuck it in the ass everyday as revenge against BTC.
I'm never going to recharge the minister satoshi sexbot, im just going to fill it with cum all day.
