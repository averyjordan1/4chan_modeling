- Only on Binance and Etherdelta- No marketing whatsoverRaiden actually has the potential to 100x from ICO price which is an investors wet dream.
Will this happen?
Depends on Raiden and who they get to use their product.
But, there is a reason why people are holding this coin atm.
First release into the main net on the 28th.
MicroRaiden -- Should be interesting.
k I will buy your bags tomorrow, is that ok anon?how do u feel about mod or vec, do you have those bags too?
100xBased on fucking what
Raiden has actual use cases right now where it can be used.
Exchanges are one example of this.
If exchanges add api's for Raiden nodes so that people can set up payment channels, it will enable low latency/cheap transfers to/from exchanges.
Obviously this isn't useful for all trading purposes but in the case of arbitrage it is fantastic.There are of course other use cases such as streaming real time payments, etc... which you can see on their site where they demo uRaiden.But hey, you can always put ur money in LINK.
So I can just run a raiden node and then the coin has no purpose.
The token is going to be used when not running full nodes which will probably be for most of the use cases seeing as people like to use wallets like metamask.Because of this, the token should be tied to how used the network is.
So, as the Raiden network is used, the value of the token will go up.
