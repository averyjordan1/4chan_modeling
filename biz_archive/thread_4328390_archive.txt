Is it really over?
How much longer will people continue holding it?
I looks like it could drop thousands at any moment.
I think i might sell everything and move to Bitcoin Cash.
make it happen
lmfao Fucking newfag detected.
This are emotions anon.
Ban them from trading.
They make you fuck things up.
Go watch a movie and drink a beer.
Move to Bitcoin Cash now for the pump up in a few hours.
Just like yesterday, when Asia woke up, Cash shot up.
Bitcoin is bleeding.
Sell Cash for profit in a few hours and exit to fiat until the dust settles
stop holding a dying coin and hop on to the easiest gains you'll ever make
Just get into ETH or fiat until things settle down
