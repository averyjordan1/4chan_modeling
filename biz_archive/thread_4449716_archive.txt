Hey /biz/ have any of you gone through the Keyspire program?
I just came back from a free event these guys put together.
The whole "Wealth Tour" is a shill operation for $1000 of your money to attend a 3-day workshop.
I also figured out there is a membership program you can buy after your take the workshop.
It's all supposed to teach you the tricks of real estate investment.
But when I asked about the membership, I was told I would have to go to the workshop to have that question answered.
It feels like their business model relies on taking advantage of mid-life-crisis boomers desperate for success.
Anyone else have experience with this company?
