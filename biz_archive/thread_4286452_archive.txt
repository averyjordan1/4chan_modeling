shill me your coin with below 4m cap, best case shortly post ico and ill throw xx eth at the winner
zcash gold (ZCG) on etherdeltabelow 1m cap, listing on coinexchange next week
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nolimitcoin/sorry, actually 40m, but still a very nice buy.
They don't want to be on a bigger exchange yet, but the website is ready.It's a fantasy sports coin, with a whole ecosystem.
Working product and shit is working.Soon you can buy directly with credit card from their website.
I believe once they go to bittrex that it will moon.It's also shilled by the crypto daily youtube guy.And if you buy now you can stake it until it's out on a bigger exchange.Long term only though.
COLX, basically PIVX lite.
lol zcash gold sorry but its a completely useless airdropped random coin 400k cap is way overvalued for this
