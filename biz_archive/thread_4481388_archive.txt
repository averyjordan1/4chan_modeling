Crypto is the most fun I've ever had investing.
Fuck the stock market.
i pulled 5% out of my long-term stock investments because they are just so goddamn boring.last few weeks in crypto have been a blast.
the entertainment alone is worth whatever loss I may take.
still up $450 atm
Nah.
Its just where most of biz is.
In 5 years, we'll either still be trading shitcoins, or we'll be back to the stock market once again.
And, we will go back to making memes like AMD (AYYY), NAK (attack), CERU (my n****r), DRYS(>investing in greece), CVM(longterm hodl) like the good ol' days.
dont ever call it investing, you're fooling yourself.It's speculation and nothing more.
Not that anything's wrong with that, but you can't call this shit investing with a straight face.
CERUMy nigga.can't believe i missed this piece of shit going to 10$
all investments are bets on the future, ergo its all gambling and speculationi wouldnt call crypto fun though its crazy shit and doesnt make any sense on top of it
There is a deeper layer of fun, the Chancoin community.
Once you innit, you live it.>#4CHNallday
