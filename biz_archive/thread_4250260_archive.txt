Feeling like a big cuck when I sold my SALT yesterday for BTC at $7000
Why.
Like.
Really.
Why did you buy salt to begin with if you didn't expect this.
I wanted to have the extra BTC coin because I knew salt product would only release in December after the fork.
IT'S HAPPENING
It's a whale.
Careful
i don't think it's possible for downtrends to look 'bullish as fuck'
it just hit 50k you fucking mong
it isn't a whale, it is SALT Lending that makes that huge wall because they are doing buybacks as promised here-https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/comments/6pa601/log_of_ama_with_saltlending_caleb_salt_caleb/They know that the tokens are gonna be worth way more than $3 so just buy them if the market dips that low.
I'm getting all I can at this price.
Negative friendo, that will happen but not until the last minute.
It *was* a whale, a whale known on too.. see what I did there
