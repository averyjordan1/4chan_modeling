Memelines ONLY apply to crypto fym
bullIt' neither bullish or bearish.
The direction it breaks will determine the bias.
ascending triangle isn't bullishAbsolute state of ta on /biz/
I'm sorry, but what are you fucking talking about?
i think its breaking down
the fucking state of biz that this wasnt the first reply
how much does it need to go up or down to confirm anything?
That's actually a coin flip,it's most likely bullish, I expect it to be bullish too.
But crypto is irrational and we're in the middle of a quarrel between devs and miners.
BTFOTFOFTB
LOOOOOLhow bullish is that chart looking now bro
yeah I was right it broke downJust sold everything
nope
like jamal's cock in your wife's rectum gottemim sorry I didn't mean that

hahahaha>lemme just readjust my lines one sec..>brb maintaining my delusionnext time try to use some other indicators alongside ur lines.. volume, macd and volume all indicated an incoming bear
Still in the triangle you dumb fuck.
Watch what happens from here.
Sure,pajeet.
Alright, looks like it's bearish now.
I had no holdings in BCH anyway, so I was actually hoping this would happen.But yea you were right, my bad.
Shit, I've progressed through every stage of that this year.
BTC falling and BCC rising.Have faith.
I don't care, I'm purely in altcoins nowAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÃ€AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
WHO GOT SHOOK OUTSeriously tho.
Btc and Bch have inverse movements.
Btc will go down tonight so guess what that means for bch
It's chink pumping and FOMO that are pushing the divergence between the two.
Fucking kek
That plus btc only reached k because people were buying for free segwit2x.
Now it's correcting and people are throwing their btc at the highest volume pump.
Bch
That's what I thought, I was right.Still in the ascending triangle.
Literally hit the bottom line perfectly and went back up.
This is ridiculously bullish.
