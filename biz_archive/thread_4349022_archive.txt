Did you guys know BCH is only for the aloha traders?
We know it might crash but we fuckin go all in anyways.
Have fuckin ball to take risk while BTC goes only up and down by 1%.
Yes, it stores value but no PROFIT what's different than just putting the money in the stock than BTC now?
Stocks are better than BTC at this point
I meant to say ALPHA*

Yes because trading is about having balls, not managing risk/rewards.
Got it.
