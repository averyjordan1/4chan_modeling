Bitfinex is using the fraudulent tethers to falsely pump BTC so longs aren't margin-called.
Notice how it starts pumping right when the negative news is announced.
After they stop shitting their pants, massive dump will commence.
Why do u think the fork getting cancelled is bad

4249800You guys must be retarded if you think BTC wouldn't dump after a canceled hard fork.
Many people bought in just for the free coins.
There is NO reason for it to pump.
Bitfinex is literally shitting their pants and pumping the price so they don't get margin called.
After they close positions, it will dump.
I didn't know a man can be so retarded, until I saw OP's statement.
Thanks, OP!
