Is this the dude that says "Mastercard processes $300 million in transactions and ChainLink is (for some reason) 1% of Mastercard so $3 million"?To be fair anyone retarded enough to believe this doesn't deserve to make any money, but it will be a funny meme when ChainLink is worth billions.
>I was the only one who knew it would fail...
>thinking a Q4 2017 ICO that is still over 2x failed >thinking something failed two months into inception>thinking something failed before the main net even launched >calling Eth a failure when it dropped from $16 to $7I also love how he tries to use Transaction fees as the comparison when ChainLink is completely different.
Itâ€™s data query fee, not a cut from the smartcontractsOP and YouTuber confirmed beyond retarded
oracle is a real problem
I was listening to the competition, a lot of times I was looking at stuff like ripple, icon, neo.
Any other smart contract, they all seem to be doing exactly the same thing.
