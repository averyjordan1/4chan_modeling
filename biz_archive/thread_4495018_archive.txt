best: at a local ATMmost convenient for americans: coinbase
depends where about in the world you live.
ATM and coinbase - you're gunna hit with a bunch of bullsht fees either way
Better buy link, it'll hit $1 next week and you can buy more Bitcoins
I can use my debit card at a national bitcoin ATM to exchange for bitcoin.I'll probably use it to fund my bittrex buy other currency's that aren't chainlink
