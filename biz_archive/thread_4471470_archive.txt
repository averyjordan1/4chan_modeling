Alright what's your honest opinion on HST?I honestly think the project has potential but the bags I'm holding are getting extremely heavy.
Yeah, me too bro..
Holding heavy bags here as well.
But I've got no options other than to hold, 'cause selling at 50% loss is stupid.We will be listed on livecoin on Wednesday.
Honestly I have no idea about this exchange, but the people in the telegram said this one has bigger volume than kucoin.Don't forget that cryptopia will also list HST before the end of this month.
Cryptopia might be our best hope to break even and stabilize the price, before binance/bittrex comes.Also the team's gonna announce their clients and partnerships in late December.
If these partners are big, we might see people fomoing HST.Iron hands, anon.
The link marines can do this, so can we.
how much u holding
I think big things are going to come.
They've had next to no major marketing, playing it very cool
k
Only 7200 HST.
Bought at 0.0008 ETH.
I thought that was the support, since it once hit 0.0012 ETH days before.You?
In December it will shine sooo goood.
So hodl for now
3100 here.Bought the ATH
Do you regret it?
What are your plans?
how much are you holding?
k, bought at 92
Just HOLD until profit
This is actually a good coin.
Just have patience.
Ignore the exchange news and wait for their announcements regarding partnerships.
Put this coin on a trezor for awhile.
bought @ 0.001250000, im gonna ride this til the bitter end.
this pretty much, had a pump recently if you bought before CMC listing and shit you made short gainsbut its clearly not a short term turn around, could be huge could just flop forget about it and lets seemy main worry is how little they raised $ wise
Apparently Kucoin just added the HST/BTC pairing.
