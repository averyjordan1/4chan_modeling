The absolute state of Biz, all of you chasing PnD like Nuls & OKcash where as all of you ignore absolutely legit projects.
Granted they did an ICO but how many projects out there boast of all these qualities?1.
LN solution and it has a working product which will be released this month.
They Demoed at Devcon3.

Vitalik himself didn't like that they did the ICO but he acknowledged why they did it.3.
Micro Raiden - A payment channel framework for fast & free off-chain ERC20 token transfers is also being released.4.
Other LN projects are years from development, Plasma is expected to come out by 2019.5.
The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution for performing ERC20-compliant token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain.
It is Ethereum's version of Bitcoin's Lightning Network, enabling near-instant, low-fee, scalable, and privacy-preserving payments.The Raiden Network allows secure transfers of tokens between participants without the need for global consensus.
This is achieved using digitally signed and hash-locked transfers, called balance proofs, fully collateralized by previously setup on-chain deposits.
Raiden has GitHub entries as old as 2 years ago and over 100k lines of code.
Why do you think Vitalik god mad at them?
He is not getting mad at any scam ICO.
He got mad because the most advanced LN solution is being released outside the core Ethereum foundation.Review by Crush Crypto - https://crushcrypto.com/analysis-of-raiden-network/Github - https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden/So yeah BIZ whats your excuse for not getting on this?
