With BCH achieving the highest 24h volume of all time, even higher than bitcoin, people are starting to take this pretty seriously.Within the next week or two, 1 group of believers will be crushed.Scary times.
I never really follow the trading volume.
Has other coins taken the #1 spot before?
I just wanna crush the skull of that disgusting ugly motherfucker called Tone vays who's been belitteling Bitcoin Cash and saying "bcash" since day 1.I would like to see his kike face now - although he's a scheming ugly bald jew so he's already knee deep in BCC.
Yeah bch took it before last time we had this "flippening" bullshit back in august and I believe Ether has had it a few times too
Someone said Ethereum and litecoin did it before
Apparently I read this is the first time it's ever happened.
Cant confirm though, read it on reddit.
Why scary?Btc believers are already rich and will just buy bch and be even more rich kek
