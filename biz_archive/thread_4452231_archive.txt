Ok guys, I tried to introduce you to this coin when it was like 3 or 4 dollars, since then it almost constantly rose up to 12$ as we speak.Why is this interesting?
The minex team is trying to create a non volatile method of crypto payment.
They do this with their shortly launched minexbank, where they offer variable interest to make hodling more attractive.
The target value is 20$ per MNX at the end of the year, so if you buy in now you have an almost guaranteed 2x while receiving interest rates of currently 5.9% per week.
Yes, per week, this is one of the best passive gain opportunities right now.After it reaches its target value they adapt interest rates so that it goes up like 40% per year in USD price.
Maybe its non volatility is not great for daytrading once it reaches the target price, but until then the possible gains are still enormous.
Also check it out, MNX is currently at rank 117 on coinmarketcap, while being available only on livecoin the last 2 weeks, bigger exchanges will follow
Okay I guess you could also miss that chance, don't say I didn't tell you
