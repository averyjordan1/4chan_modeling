Who else fell for this shitcoin?Thankfully I only threw an eths worth of btc at it at the time.
what went wrong
its the massive amount of uncirculating supply getting dumped
unironically a great time to put in a small something.
assuming the team pulls out of the bs thats going on and burn 100 mil coins it will see a decent pump
The video presentation on their website looks like it's narrated by a filipino off of fiverr, not sure how you fell for this....
I was drunk and desperate for a pump
