Is this board for discussing other business & finance topics such as jobs in the industry and tips & tricks for people wanting to get business and finance jobs?I work as a forensic accountant and wonder if I can just chat with people and maybe answer questions about business shit or talk with other accountants
The fuck you talkin about old man, this is for flipping shitcoins.
You wanna buy my digibytes?

Thats sad, I wanted to talk shit with people in the business industry.>You wanna buy my digibytes?No I don't wanna buy any of your fucking crypto monies I want to rant about how fucksticks in my workplace can't understand cash flows so when I do a quarterly report on the current financial situation I have to deal with some fuckweed asking me the same 5 questions over and over.
Nothing beats the god forsaken business managers in HR asking me BASIC SHIT.
I was once asked "whats debit and credit mean"
Bump.
Well fuck this
Sorry I was thinking about making a reply but your post bored me to sleep, you wanna buy these digibytes or not old man?
Bitbeans?
Monero?
I got whutchu need homie.
Why can't I just talk shit about working in the business sector?
Everyone in finance seems to be braindead, I don't know how the industry functions.
The things you're bringing up are some of the most generic types of small talk I can possibly imagine though, why would anyone be interested in being on the receiving end of that?
That's the kind of shit a GTA pedestrian says, like I don't even know man.
Being a wagecuck sounds like a real hoot.
