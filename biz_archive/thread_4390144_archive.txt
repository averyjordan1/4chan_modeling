Binance, Poloniex or Bittrex?Or some other exchange?
You can't margin trade on Binance.
Use all three.
Therefore if one ext scams you'll still be okay if you lose some coin
This, but even more than those three.
Not necessarily because exit scams, although it is a valid point, but also because of different coin listings.
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind
