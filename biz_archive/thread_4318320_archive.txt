I just woke up and lost 29% on ETC...I broke one of my rules not to buy ATH in a long time and I deserved it, please laugh at me
we all do it from time to time, but desu I bought bch at an ATH yesterday and made 500 euro in 40 minutes (which is a nice amount of money for me, fugg off)
buying etcThere is your mistakeFuck classic
i forgive you, couldve been worse, you could've bought bcc at ath
I sold BCH when it was ATH and then re-bought when it dropped by 20%...only for it to crash.
bought it at $20.
It's not coming back up is it?
only if bitcoin cash surgues again.
sold mine at a loss, luckly I put only $200 onto it so I lost $58, could of bought some nice tech with that...
Well I would suggest you that you dont sell that ETC, because there is a good chance that there will be some nice pumps in the following weeks.>We have the Hong Kong ETC summit from 13-14 November.>After changing logo of emerald wallet, it needs to come out in the future some time>Monetary Policy blockreward dropps from 5 - Etc Bought my first Etc at 5 dollars still hodling.Some guys on twitter are still quite sure about a nice surge in price .
what is the reason behind the latest rise in price?
I'm not that sure, but maybe because the Parity wallet bug with the stuck ETH coins, but that s only my guess.
buying at ath isn't always bad.
anyone who bought bch @ sub .4 yesterday and sold in time made money.
anyone who bought btc at ath from 3k to 6k and also made money.just be careful when doing so.
>buy 25% max, so that even if your buy halves in price you're still left with almost 90% of your starting stack.
