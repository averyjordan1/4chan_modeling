I haven't been following this coin but I am a developer and noticed the gamecredits partnered with Unity last week.
I don't know why this coin is so cheap.
Unity is the biggest game development engine in the world.
If Gamecredits is partnered with them this is huge!
Anon let me know what you think.
They partnered with Unity?
Cheers for the heads up lad.
