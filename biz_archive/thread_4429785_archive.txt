BUY QTUM
No
any news bro?
Google Qtum satellites
okso they're launching a satelliteand there's talk about them actually being the Asian Ethereum and not that imposter NEO
I've got a decent stake in QTUM as a hedge for NEO.
ink is pretty interesting
The QTUM head is a known scammer.
Look it up
Just check what is coming : ICO will be developed on it.
All asian exchange buy it, it's dirt cheap right now.
If you think NEO will be "CHina Eth" you're dreaming, Amerifats love NEO because it made them rich but don't think china gvt will choose NEO because "trendy"
This is true.
main reason i will never invest in qtum.
NEO is far superior, there is literally no need for QTUM.
This is almost bitconnect tier scam.
Multiple pump and dumps.Do you really think this deserves a higher marketcap than OMG?
it's an actual blockchain with many dapps planned in the near future.
patrick dai might have been implicated in some past shit but, for the most part, it seems the name change/multiple pov stories on it kinda clear him.
plus qtum is a much larger team.
their roadmap looks good and they do work hard.that being said, i am more bullish on neo due to chinese nationalism.
Qtum is an ETH and Bitcoin hybridNeo is a cheap ripoff of ETH
$14 damn
QTUM's mobile wallet is slick as fuck.
Imagine ETH doing the same thing.
Oh wait...
