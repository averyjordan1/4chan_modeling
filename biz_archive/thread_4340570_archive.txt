What's the alternative to coinbase and bittrex if I can't use them in Estonia?
Is bittfinex or kraken good?
Kraken is good if you use eur
And I don't have to use bittrex for it like suggested when storing coins?
Kraken is ok though they're a bit anal with photo ID if you want to get Tier 3 verification.
But otherwise easy enough to use I've had no problems.
Kraken or Bitstamp with sepa transfers.Binance and Bitfinex for alts.
Also, don't daytrade on kraken, it's a laggy piece of shit but reliable for everything else.
What do you mean?You can store your coins on an exchange or on your personal wallet.
