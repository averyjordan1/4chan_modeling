Hello, I'm a certified financial analyst and I'm here to give free investment advice.
Let's get right into it.
Will BCH moon within a few days?
Are we near floor.
you might prevent a few suicides if you can figure out a way to convince some of the people here that putting your life savings into crypto is not a good idea.
jokes on you im killing myself no matter what happens
Try to convince these retards not to buy scamcoins
Crypto is their last shot.
Go all in every time..
But buy in chunks.
Also just be yourself and you'll do fine.
where can i learn?
Fuck your mother.
I lied I'm not a real analyst, I'm a guy who went all in on Guppy.
Please buy my bags.
Can I set up some kind of fund and put my money into that so I can make trades without creating taxable events?
Better yet, can I roll my portfolio into this fund without even going back to cash and lock in my tax rate prior to my latest investments?
Certified or Chartered?and if certified, by what institute?
you mean besides your Roth IRA?
assuming your from the US
I don't think there are tax sheltered accounts for crypto, at least not yet
When ICO sir?
