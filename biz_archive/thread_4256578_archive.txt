Would it be worth it to throw some spare change into doge?
I mean, look at the chart.
the first shit coin
Should come back
Not the first, but the first one that became a meme
grreat team
if you don't have at least $500 worth of this you're clearly not playing to win
$5k in this shitcoin at the bottom of market.
Don't forget LDOGE
The cycle hasn't ended yet We've got a few months of sitting on the floor before we allowed to get back up
I did
I think the fork upset the cycle.
But the fork has been 'canceled' so who knows?
Well either way if you got the spare cash to buy in now, it's a good go
Im holding 97 dogecoin will i make it boys??
