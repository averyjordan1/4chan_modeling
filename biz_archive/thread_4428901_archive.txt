Should I always withdraw my BTC or ETH from exchange onto paper wallet?
I have about 1kâ‚¬ invested, but fees are going to kill me if I trade all the time with that kind of money.
What should I do?
Just trust the exchange and hope funds don't go missing out?
depends on the exchange.
What are trustworthy exchnges?
