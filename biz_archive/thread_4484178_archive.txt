Hello /biz/Yesterday i had the opportunity of talking with Giancarlo Devasini, CFO of Bitfinex and Director of Tether inc. How you will say?
Well i just found his address on the Paradise paper leak and turns out he lives about 600m from my home.https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80056584I was actually surprised to get answered when i ringed on the intercom.
These are my toughts on the "interview" i made him, i only ask you to NOT share it outside of /biz/ since the first thing he said to me was that i couldn't absolutely register or publish the conversation.Basically he's the classic guy who plays with money, and already had some serious trouble with italian taxes in his residence in Piemonte back in the days.He presented himself as a digital entrepeneur and expert of digital currency.
Problem is he couldn't even tell me how a blockchain works from a technical point of view.This was the first red flag to me.Then we talked about the recent evolution of Bitfinex and Tether situation, all he could say was that a "formal announcment was to come" but he was absolutely deceptive when i asked him some proof of solvency for Tether or why an audit was still not present.
I decided to stop asking things when he started looking pretty annoyed by my questions.
Summing up, the conversation was pretty useless, but it helped me making a clear idea of who is running the businesses:The classical stereotype of the tax evader that likes women and lambos and that doesn't lose the occasion of sticking something up your ass just to make some profit.
Unfortunately i couldn't ask him of the hack, since the news come out only this morning (FUCK!
), but my opinion is that more will come, and won't be good for the markets.
Worst case scenario is an exit scam and looking at the kind of guy this is totally possible.Stay vigilant /biz/tl;dr: talked with Bitfinex CFO.
A tax evader that plays with money and legality.
An exit scam is possible and the hack may be a lie.
>NOT share it outside of /biz/We won't share your LARP, we promise.
LOL LARP
You really don't need to larp.
Tether and Bitfinex being fraudulent is becoming obvious.
stereotype of the tax evader that likes women and lambosLOL.
Isn't that like ALL of us here?

Unfortunately i couldn't ask him of the locked ico wallets, since the news come out only this morning (FUCK!

This is quite an advanced LARP

thanx OP
He can be a larp.But the link about the offshore is real, and thats the real deal.Tether being fraudulent is fucking obvious.
Someone post the bitcointalk screenshot for good measure.
