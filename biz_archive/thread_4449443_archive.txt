hey guys tenx is about to breakout
Got me excited for a bit, these bags are heavy
big news are coming.
the devs are some the largest bagholders actually, they just dont care about shortterm.
big news are coming
CEO said so multiple times in his videos.
They just don't feel like it's the right time to announce anything ..
How do you know?
you got a card?
i am holding this one, not hodling, if you know what I mean

Can I get a crypto debit card right now and start paying for products with it at walmart?
Or is this just some whitepaper idea that'll never actually happen.
And why does a middleman between crypto and credit processors need it's own token?
