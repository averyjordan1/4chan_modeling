Your fault for buying a shitcoin PnD.
Consider it a valuable lesson.
well green ID confirms.this has been haunting me ever since
 lmao welcome to the bag holder mentality.
You've invested so much emotionally and financially that you'll never sell.
Meanwhile idgaf about LINK but made 15% and 12% of the past two decent runs.

People like you are the reason even the not so great investors like me can make a profit trading crypto here and there.
Thanks.
