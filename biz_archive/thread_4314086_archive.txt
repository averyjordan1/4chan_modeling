When will you faggots learn.Step 1: Buy BTC, Announce BTC2x forkStep 2: Sell all your 2x futures, announce you're cancelling 2xStep 3: wait a little, buy cheap 2x futures, then announce 2x will continue as planned.
Sell the 2x futures for BTC which is now at an ATL for the month because people are confused about the fork and went back to alts.Step 4: okay, you've now at least turned your $1 billion into $5 billion.
Why not buy a shit ton of BCH, and then attack BTC with thousands and thousands of transactions that will bog everything down, be sure to do this conveniently when the mining difficulty makes BCH more profitable than BTC, to add to the FOMO.Step 5: (this step will be seen in the next few days) Sell all the BCH for BTC when one is at an all time high, and the other is down almost 15-20%.
If you haven't made 10's of billion's off this, you're doing market manipulation wrong.Step 6: (optional) rather than step 5, just do everything you can to keep BCH rising, since your company, which has a monopoly on ASIC miners, would then control cryptocurrency.
