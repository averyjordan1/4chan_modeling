The illegal stuff is generally illegal because it makes the meat unsafe.
You'd also have to get the meat back into a country to distribute and it'd need to be certified.
Purchase meat processing plants as fronts to export the meat, or sell the meat to traders and leave it to them to deal w/ it.
You could also export to countries with lax meat regulations.
As for the unsafe meat bit, I'd take the risk.
