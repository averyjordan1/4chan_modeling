Should I sell my ETH now for a loss?
or will it go up after this hack of the ETH wallets?
sell for the king you will thank me in few months
just sold there at 30% loss.
i believe in the whitepaper but this bitch has gone downhill ever since i bought it so its time to go
for the king you mean BTC?
Buy the dip.
You really think small fry like this is going to take money skelly out?
I wouldn't unless you have no king, fucking pray and hodl to post fork
no, Bongger
I'm thinking no.
what would you buy instead?
dont.
its going up as soon people exits btc for eth before the fork, then run to fiat, wait for the 30% correction in btc, buyback
Bruh, stick to your gut and get away from biz.
This is the reason I can make money.
Thanks anon
