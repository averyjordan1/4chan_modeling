Ok fellas so my laptop crashed.
Seems like the only thing I can do is reset my pc which would keep my personal files.
I was staking a crypto and it wasn't backed up.
By resetting my pc it would "remove apps and settings, but keep your personal files" would I be able to recover the wallet or am I completely fucked
Thats a good question, that pic is horrible though.
You don't have to use that much fat for cooking
Do you just need to back the files up?
Why can't you just use a live distro for that?
Go back to your room, lock the door, pray to every god you know, wait for your wife to come back, tell her you need to burn the house with her sister inside
you have obviously never been to an indians house when there cooking.
Plz help I don't want to lose my coins
I am praising the lord that I can assure you I indeed haven't
Plz help
If you have the wallet file is that enough to recover the wallet
