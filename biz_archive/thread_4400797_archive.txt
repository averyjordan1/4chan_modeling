This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Low market cap, amazing product, team making progress and securing partnerships.Ripple mooned 100 times when they partnered with some shitty banks, what do you think will happen when Swift announces their partnership with the link team?
Don't lose this chance.
I hope so.
The only thing that gets me through the day at work
