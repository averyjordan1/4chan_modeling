just buy stocks.there are tons of stocks that pay 4-5% dividends
get a masternode coin like VIVO.
It's currently around 5k to get enough coins (1000) to run a masternode.
Once you do ROI is around $40 per day.
Easy money in addition to the appreciation in price of the coin.
also, CSNO = bitdice70% of the profits from the casino are paid in ETH dividends every quarter.
the first dividend will be Jan 2018.
It will easily also be a multi dollar coin once they get their fiat license in a month or two.
