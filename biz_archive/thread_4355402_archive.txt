I have noticed that most people in BCH JUST threads have less than 1btc worth of crypto.
They are all noobs!Noobs get JUSTed, that is natural law.
BTC about to be next.The king will fall due to ETH claiming the throne.
hanging out on 4chan>expecting anything of value and virtueThey all want to drive Lambos and live in castles of course they gonna crash hard.
Yup they are coinlets who are desperate about getting a ticket to lamboland since they are late to crypto.
That is the unifying psychological trait of etherfags too looking at the eth subplebbits.
Earlier this year they were drunk on the possibility of a flipping but nowadays they are more modest.
Bcash won't stick around like eth though, holders will be humbled more brutally.
this is what happens when you take meme-ing too far, boys and girls
