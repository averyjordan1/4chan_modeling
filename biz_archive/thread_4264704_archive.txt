The miners only went along with SegWit because they were promised larger blocks.
That promise was broken.
Guess their next move..
No, they won't switch to BCH.
It's not profitable enough after the EDA gets removed.
So far as I know, the difficulty algo will be changed to something that adjust more quickly, rather than once in 2 weeks or so.Have no idea how it is going to play out.
Might be worth to have a little of BCH still.
What a retarded image.
Autistic retard.
They promised hot Asian girls instead?
give me one reason why BCH will "flip" Bitcoinor shut the fuck up with these retarded threads
Hashing power moves permanently to BCH and BTC chain becomes so slow that it's unusable?
BCH is not going to have more than 10% of BTC's hashrate if its value is less than 10%.
The miners were given no choice to accept segwit.
Why don't you go cry a river for them and ride their dick to console them OP.
You understand nothing.
So miners will decide to mine at a loss?Are you one of those that think more miners = more value for the coin?it's quite the opposite, miners go where the value is.
Kewl story bro
The chink miners will fuck off and die.
