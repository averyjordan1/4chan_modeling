/biz owns most of this pice of shit
this pretty much sums it up
Fuck this coin, I bought in at ATH, it's killing me.
it is time for a final solutionperma ban all no LINKers from this forum
i own 0 link because i have 0 faith in sergey & his team over at smartcuntract dot comits almost like he's just the fucking CEO of a website.
it's like he feels smart because he got into crypto slightly earlier than others, and had the foresight to buy a fucking slick domain name.good job sergey, but i'm not buying your gaycoin
Proud to say I just bought my first LINK during this dip.
I'm onboard
welcome aboard, remember, we never sell
He said at Devcon that the price will be where it currently is for the next 10 years but that it’s fine if it’s used

Hail Sergey.
Hail Victory.
i don't plan on selling.
I've been through so many dips/corrections/crashes i'm numb to this shit.
But my strategy makes this easy cause i only buy low
