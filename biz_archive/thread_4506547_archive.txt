I FINALLY DID ITI SOLD MY STUPID LINK BAGS TO CHASE THESE POWR/QSP PUMPSLET'S GOOOO
You are like a week late....
A week like for Power.
He's getting in close to the ground floor on QSP.>tfw sold my QSP yesterday to buy more Link bags and QSP is up another 50% and Link is down another 5%.Really starting to think this coin is dead.
Why the fuck do people think either of these tokens have value?
With POWR I can at least see the hype around the team and their progress but they even admitted the only reason for their token was to raise funds.With QSP it is even worse, you're literally just buying into an insanely inflationary crypto where the devs just hand it out to reward people arbitrarily, no actual use for the token itself.
You're retarded, QSP is a smart contract auditing/security platform with two FB employees, same college as money Skelly, extremely aggressive YCombinator partner, and the only way to pay for their services is with QSP.
It has probably the highest use case out of any coin besides BTC and ETH.
lol, retard.
Try harder next time.In the future you can buy electricity to your home for a lower rate than what your traditional electricity company would have
when stinky linkies sell for your shitcoin you know the bullmarket is over
Buy high, sell low.
OP is taking it a step further.Buy high, sell low to buy high
