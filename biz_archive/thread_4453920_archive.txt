Hey /biz/, It's automated Google sheets portfolio guy again.

Been hodling for around 4 months now, and I'm pretty happy so far.
Portfolio could be more diversified though.
As you can see there have been some pretty clear winners for me.
Tabs at the bottom let you see the graphs and shit.
I use coinmarketcap's API to update coin prices every 5 minutes, and every 1 hour I update the net worth /individual holdings by saving it to the spreadsheet.
Using the historical data, I can track my portfolio over time.
