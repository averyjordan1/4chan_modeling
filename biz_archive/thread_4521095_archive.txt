Great plan.
Sell bags directly to family on thanksgiving.
Come back home with tens of thousands in cash, untraceable.
Family members will need their own pink wojaks tho
Congrats.
I’m sure most anons here aren’t as fortunate as you
Bitcoin Cash will impress them with instant transfers and low fees.
>talking about bitcoin in public or with familytotal cringe, any time people get all uppity and excited about it I just avoid the conversation in embarassment.
I don’t talk about crypto with my family because it is cringe.
I also don’t want to advise they go in to something to where they could lose thousands.
Absolutely not.
The only problem with boomers is that they didn't have a balanced life.
You'd be hurting them further by handing them the millenials' path out of slavery (giving them yet another indulgence they didn't earn).
It's time for the baby boomers to become adults.
Tldr: let them burn with their fiat
