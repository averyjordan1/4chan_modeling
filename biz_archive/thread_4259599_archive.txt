So why hasn't Bitcoin Cash gone up with all the other alts yet?
Maybe people are just confused about which chain was being forked and they'll jump on as soon as they realize that this is actually more valuable now.
because it's not an "alt", it's an imposter.
deserves death.
Stop trolling.
Its over.
You Faggots lost.
Deal with it.
Brainlet, Bitcoin Cash is not Segwit2X.
is this a serious question?
that think is propped up like weekend at bernies.
you're a fucking moron to think it's going to do well
propped upby what exactly?
People simply don't care.
They didn't see BCC as an alternative to B2X.
They saw B2X as free money.
That's it.
Propped up by competent investors and speculators.
I can't even tell the paid shills from the retards anymore but I'm fairly certain of the following;This guy is a paid troll and posts this in every BCH thread with the same retarded image and statementAnother paid trollThis guy is a moron who will get wiped out eventually
Its just another altcoin, move on, nobody can dethrone the real king aka BTC
it was going to win had s2x not been cancelled
it was going to win when it had more competitionI really don't understand how that's the case.
BCH is going to go wild in the next seven days
BTC stops being useful for what got it market adoption in the first place>It's digital gold!
It doesn't matter if you can't transact it!
Total market cap of gold: 2.5 trillionTotal market cap of all money: 30 trillionKeep your fucking "digital gold".
