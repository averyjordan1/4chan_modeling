Q2 maybe.
Don't rush them on the API network.
It's done when it's done & they don't get a 2nd shot at it given their partners.
Reminder this has better devs and is a direct competitor for LINK.
Shills are trying to make you forget that this is the real deal and pulling one over on you trying to get you to buy LINK shitcoins while whales buy this.https://mobius.network/
this is true.
they only got one shot because the businesses they are working with are huge, serious, and absolutely critical to the world.
but I trust Sergey to close the deal.
they will DO this.
and it's on all of us to have Sergey in our prayers.
Stop attacking people like Rory as well.
these people need our support.
I've just about had it with 4chan's weaponized autism.We have a serious shot at making it big here.
We missed BTC.
We missed ETH.
Some of us, including yours truly, made money on NEO.
But it just wasn't the same.
We need another biggie, and this is it.
LINK is what is gonna send us all straight to fucking lambo land.
THIS IS IT.Don't you WANT this?
I know I do.
Get on board.
Stop being stupid n short sighted.
BUY LINK.
This is just sad anon.
Trips and cool pepe have spoken.
Keep Sergey, Steve, and yes even Rory in your nightly prayers.
when ever i see that frog i automatically become in a good mood
I would love that, but this is going to take longer than ETH because old money has to start using it.
Team full of pajeetsLol
I say a prayer for the whole team every night.
Even Rory yep
Checked!
Frog-san everyone needs you in their life, if only for moral support
They are creating something from the ground up and its an original idea that actually solves a problem.
Maybe thats scary for some basement dwellers but its pure genius in my opinion.
Once again.
Its not another wallet.
Another exchange.
Another privacy coin.
Another platform.
Another this.
Another that.
This is Chainlink.
