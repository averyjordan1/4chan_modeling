US Treasury Department Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that his department is conducting an investigation on the illegal applications of the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
He claimed that the probe is intended to ensure that the digital currency is not utilized for “unlawful purposes.”During an interview with Yahoo Finance as of early November 2017, the secretary claimed that the alleged illicit use of Bitcoin should be reviewed “very carefully” to make sure that the dark web is not financed in Bitcoin.
"So we want to make sure that you don't have the dark web funded in Bitcoins.
And that's something that is a concern of ours today."
They just woke up?
It has been going on since 2013...

Banks have been caught redhanded laundering FIAT for cartels.
Maybe we should investigate the use of federal reserve notes for illicit activity.
This is step 1 in the FUD process so Wall Street can buy in cheap.
