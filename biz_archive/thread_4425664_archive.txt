Will this get me to fordfiestaland?
Dump the Rec, leave the NEO If you want to gamble on an ICO try POWR.
If you want a more secure cheaper future go with BQX or ARK
dump rec pick up eth

long term crypto investingfuck you, i made that mistake twice, never again.
different for me.
I tried daytrading and I'm never doing it again.
mid term is the best imo...one two months max.
the longer you hold, the higher the chance bitcoin does a crazy run and fucks your shit beyond repair.
