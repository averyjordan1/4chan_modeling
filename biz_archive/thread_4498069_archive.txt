How can you profit from starting/buying your own town?
I know it can be expensive to run, but what are ways you can profit from it?
Dozens of small towns for sale here cheaper than if you got a house in Toronto.Getting people to live there seems easy enough, make it kind of a niche town, give away free lands etc.pic unrelated
