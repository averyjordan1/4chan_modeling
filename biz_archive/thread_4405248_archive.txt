Holy shit, this 10 minute difficulty adjustment shit is legit.
Even after BTC pumped like hell the gap is still closing in.
november 26, never forget.
Whats on November 26?
WTF, i thought these bcash cucks were kidding about this.
Literally another 10 minutes after and its now flipped.
I'm gonna guess it's next approximate difficulty readjustment for BTC.
in which case the profitability to mine BCH will go above BTC and BCH bagholders are hoping to see another attempt at a BCH bull run.
