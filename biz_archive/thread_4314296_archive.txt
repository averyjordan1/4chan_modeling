So why the fuck has bittrex BTC/BCC pair CRASH FUCKING RIGHT BEFORE A DUMP
(((pure coincidence))) goyimI'm cashing all my fucking coins out and leaving this fucking shitshow forever before I kill myself
sell now if you are on bittrex.
The dump is bound to happen and the server is crashing to delay
Gods I'm fucking going to be sick idk whether to hodl or sell
Rumor was that koreans were planning to dump out when it crossed 2.1k.
Most rumors are bullshit, this one looks like it may not be.
If you are in profit sell.
Don't get greedy
i cant cancel my buy order what the fuck is going on
Buy high, sell low.
Hash rate approx puts appropriate value at 1.8k right now.
For What?
Eth?
At the very least sell enough BCH to even yourself out on BTC and BCH
If you like being poor, keep holding.
hodl you pussy
election night all over again
