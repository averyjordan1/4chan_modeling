Nop.

what kind of scam, tell us a little about it.
then it depends on a viewpointFrom the moral point of view, you are a good guyFrom the profit point, you are dumbfuckFrom the business point of view, you are smart, because people you scam don't wanna continue doing business with you
shill and pumps are detrimental to the long term hodlers.

If you would've gotten away with it, you fucked up.
If there was a risk of getting caught, you did the right thing
You're just fine.
