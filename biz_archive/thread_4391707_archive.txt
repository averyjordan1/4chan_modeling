Where my bitcore crew at from a couple days ago?
I got in at $4.
Is this going north of 1k?
Am I gonna make it?
Why is this mooning?
Because it's being listed on HitBTC todayhttps://twitter.com/Bitcore_BTX/status/929466266741628929?s=17
wow, this coin its gona moon, got listed also on a japanese exchage Bit-z and on Tradesatoshi
% up, why should I even consider to buy it NOW?
Because it's a much better coin than Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcore is faster than Bitcoin Cash and has a larger blocksize 20 MB (Bitcore) vs. 8 MB (Bitcoin Cash).
It has Segwit and Bloom Online and it's only trading at $25.
Why waste $1000 on an inferior coin such as Bitcoin Cash?
In addition, Bitcore has a 3% airdrop every Monday, as long as you own some Bitcore coins in your wallet and register the address on www.Bitcore.cc.
The airdrops will increase to 4% next month, 5% in January, 6% in February and continue to increase by 1% each month until the coins have been fully distributed.
That's free money every Monday.Also, the official circulating supply of $BTX is actually up to 11,419,386 now, but CoinMarketCap hasn't updated this yet.
This makes the actual marketcap around $180,000,000, so as soon as CMC update this, $BTX will jump straight into the Top 100 at around #36.
