/biz/ TLDR = The current Saudi Prince turmoil is causing havoc with Dubai's markets/holdings.
Just like a market crash in the US would cause people to put their money in BTC, expect some people to put money into DBIX.
- In 2012, the corporation that I spent 5 years working for went through an overhaul and I was left with a lot of college loans and literally no money to pay to live in Northern California.
I got a job working for Dubai Nasdaq.
Don't expect anyone to know this, but all of the Middle Eastern Markets have crashed in the last few days - with expectations that it will only get worse.
Many people plan to pull out of the markets Friday and Saturday.
Because banking is complex in the UAE, there is a lot of talk of converting money into Cryptocurrency as well as experimenting in DBIX / the future exchange.
Almost all of NASDAQ DUBAI has had major funding come from the Saudi Princes' shell corporations , and with everything going down the way it has - they might want to put their money into the more anonymous Crypto moving forward.
The epitome of delusion.
