I just lost a bunch of money due to a bittrex error.
I wouldn't mind losing money on a bad trade.
but losing it to a bittrex fuck up, and technical difficulty is just wrong.
I would really appreciate if anyone in a similar situation has made it back and would like to support.

I lost 70% end October cos of going all in on some bullshit and then panicking into another couple of bullshits to try and quickly make back initial losses.
Diversified since then in slow burning growers/coins which aren't total shit while I practice trading with small amounts and educate myself on TA stuff and general discipline so that never happens again.
yeah dude losing 70% of your money because you missed the 20 second window to sell is totally bittrex's fault, not yours for buying into a pnd shitcoin

Probably got rekt buy MTL?
Some anons said it's market on trex went offline during a crazy pump
Not on MTL.
but reading they had outage too
I got this fucking error when i realised the pump for powr had arrived.
Missed the gigantic dick pump and lost out on like 30% extra gainz

This is not a community, this is a place where people meme and predate each other
>using any exchange starting with a bdisgusting
Next time buy WaBi certified products instead of scam.
uh...so you fomo bought and tried to cancel when it dumped, but the order already filled and you think thats bittrex's fault?
lmfao
You've still got plenty of time.
We've got so much room to grow I think almost anything reputable will net you gains in the long run.
I don't think I've ever lost 70% of my portfolio cause I don't go that hard on any one coin.
Went from â‚¬3800 to 1800 at one point.
Panic sold and stayed out for a month.
Then added 2000 and made that 3800 into 7000 now just by holding BTC/ ETH/LTC and trading with 10% in daily shitcoins....
