Is it better to do analyses of alts in terms of btc, or usd?
I have no idea what is quantitative analysis but i keep both shitcoin/BTC and BTC/USD open at all times when daytrading a shitcoin.
Depends what you want to earn, you mongrel.
I'd say BTC since you would have been better of just holding BTC if you loose in BTC value, this all relies on the assumption BTC will remain king.
