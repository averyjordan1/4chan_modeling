BTC is about to pump!
...down.
Bitcoin Cash is the real coin and the true Satoshis Vision.
I don't even know who's trolling who anymore.
PEDO COIN IS TRUE GOD
Ich am confus
SELL ALL ALTS NOWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHamirite?
Yes, you should sell Bitcoin Core.
It will choke on its small blocks even before Blockstream can take complete control over the development.
Look at the BTC chart.
It's due to go up a little.
I'm not saying it's going to pump over 7000 but def to the upper 6000's range.
Every pro BTC post is being hit with a lot of BCH shills.
That's how you know who's trolling.
v. bullish on chuck E. cheese token
BTC clearly won the battle, bound to break free from it's 6000-6500 chains any time soon
I actually think it's a great time to hold 60% BTC 30% ETH and the remaining 10% in whichever 1 or 2 alts you think are worth it.
