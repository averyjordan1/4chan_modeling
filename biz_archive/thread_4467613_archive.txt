James - Confido supportHi everybody, I've been in contact with Joost over the current technical issues and he has assured me that it will be possible to get all of your money back, however the problem has been with our server providers not receiving funding due to our bank suddenly pulling access to our accounts for an unexplained reason.
It is possible that we may have lost access to our main account but your funds are still absolutely safe.What we're advising is that to ensure the best outcome for you that donations are made to our Bitcoin address which we will use to reactivate the servers, thus allowing the refund process to commence.The address is here:16meZMCQDcgskEjTHVq9hn6xjV7o4jzekeThank you for your patience but we really believe in this product and we understand that in the current circumstances that there is some alarm but we can now reassure our investors that we will be proceeding as normal shortly.Thank you.- James
