This is last time im posting about this.Other two times i got insults.Those insulting me missed out on an easy 50% today and 25% the day before, so gj.I'm not a shill, not a bag holder, i bought low.This is going to at least double still.Dont care if you dont believe me, but remember that you read it here and did nothing.
Puh-lease...This is a real company with a future, biz only wants useless shitcoins for pump and dumps.
didn't know it went up so muchI've had a bag of FCT sitting in my polo account untouched for 6 monthsnice little treat
It's all priced in
Great idea; buy the pump once it's already happened.Fuck off.
Up another 15% since you posted this.Fuck off.
This dumb
this is fucking insane!
I'm thinking a target of 500k at this rate
now it's priced in.
Oh, and to clarify the "already pumped" thing:I would never advise anyone (in general) to FOMO into an ACTIVE pump.
Always wait for the pull back if something is going insane!That doesn't mean, however, that you should write off a good coin that is doing well and has a lot of room to grow in a raging bull market for alts just because it already went up.Admittedly, buying yesterday, or the day before, when I posted about this, would have been better.But I bought more today at 282.
