Anyone else noticing that the Korean/Chinese pump of ETC is about to eclipse ETH 24/hr volume?
When BCH did this to BTC, it started to drop from its support at $6,600-$6,700.The fuck is this asian manipulation bullshit.
why ius ethereum classic being pump now by the koreans?
ITS THE SAME SHIT THAT IS HAPPENING TO BUTTCOIN.
ITS RETARDED COUSIN IS GOING FULL RETARD.
That's what I want to know.
I know the Koreans like the coin, but it's either a) a pump and dump b) a chance for chinks to take BCH profit and multiple it further or c) an Ethereum flippening.
a and b are not mutually exclusive and I think c is highly unlikely and meme-tier desu
>Korean/Chineseyou racist fuck, ETC is having a summit in 2 days, price has been rising the last two weeks as it gets closer
I made about 10 threads the last days.
nobody fucking cared.
"Muh etc is eth abortion"fucking losers, go farm -% with your other shitty altsThe reason ist the ETC summit that takes place next week and shows the huge amount of new developments that possibly can outshine ETH in the future.
Thats what everybody is speculating on.
more spoonfeeding, please.
