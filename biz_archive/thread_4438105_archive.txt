I want to talk to you guys about Power Ledger.A year ago I was discussing crypto and dApps, which were the new hotness at the time with a learned friend.
We were just spitballing but he suggested a token that would put electricity on the blockchain, to help facilitate and reward the new decentralised, smart power grids.
You know everyday people are power generators now with solar panels but often they're not home to use the power they're generating and they're getting jewed by the power companies.I was really excited about it and spoke to some of the academics I knew at Murdoch Uni, where I had recently graduated.
They said "yeah, you're not the first to have this idea, I really want to tell you more, have you considered post graduate study?
"But I kinda forgot about it and never pursued postgrad study because my gf and I moved away.Today I saw the Mayor of Fremantle, where I used to live, post this on Facebook.
