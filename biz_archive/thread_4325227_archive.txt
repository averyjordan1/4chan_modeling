Take a knee for this one.
A very close point of contact to me, who is an employee at Omise, confirmed that the launch of the wallet will be December 4th.
It will be announced at the BlockChain World Conference in Bangkok, Thailand along with an update on blockchain progression and staking reward %.We should expect the price to dip this week a little more in correlation to further BTC price correction.
After that, between insider trading and possible subtle hints by the team on social media, the climb will begin.
Good luck.
