So guys, lets lay out some plain sense.Coming up to the fork, BTC will increase.
Who knows by how much, but it probably has a few more points up it's sleeve.That's when you'll have serious buying power.
If you spend that on shitcoins en masse, post fork, BTC will certainly dump, shit will rise, and you're going to trade back for vast BTC revenues, and ride the BTC train all the way to Valhalla.Right?
