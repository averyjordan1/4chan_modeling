I got my start on /biz/ way back when, so i owe you guys a few.
i can tell you for sure bitcoin-cash is about to pump.
sell at 0.4Thank me later.
also transfer BTC into eth or monero for safety.
this will all blow over in a day or two
don't miss it again.
buy right now, it will go down to $1360 at its lowest.
And what do you boys suspect will be left when the dust settles in a day or two?
BTC will hit 8k.This is all a poly to drop the price of btc and get bag holders to finally move and sell their coin.
BCC is done, missed it's 2k target ten minutes ago in order to keep the pump going.
Get out now.
