chinese and koreans are sleeping bch/bcc is stabilizing like yesterday while us westerners are awakeonce theyre awake the trend will continuebch will touch .25 sats today or at least near it before it dipsit most likely will peak past .25-.27
i predicted it will hit .17 and put a sell at .169 but holy crap was not expecting it to shoot to .23in all honesty i wouldnt be surprised if it shot past .30
This BCH volume is unreal.
Do you think BCH will eventually surpass BTC's mcap?
there was an article that the bitcoin core developers put out that said they expect bch to take over in 6 months.
theyre supporting bch to take the mantle
Thank you.
no problem.
I recognize your tripcode and thanks for yesterday's advice post
No problem man i wouldn't post with my name if i didn't believe in it.Don't get me wrong I'm not right 100 percent but no one is in trading.
Only reason why i started trading was that i realized 85% of my calls are generally spot on.
