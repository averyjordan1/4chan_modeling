how do i create a secure wallet without downloading a 25gb copy of the blockchain
mymonero.com is a safe and secure web wallet run by FluffyPony a well known BTC early adopter and lead developer for Monero
can i use mymonero offline
remote node
I do not believe so but I am not 100% surefor more indepth questions go to freenode on mirc and join #monero devs will answer any questions u havelead dev fluffypony is usually in chat
you can just make a wallet without syncing.
you will have to sync or use a remote node when you want to spend those funds though.also the most secure way would be generating a paper wallet on an airgapped computer with this site: https://moneroaddress.org/
I have 250 OMG, I'm thinking of moving some into monero.
Thoughts?
It seems high right now but I'm not as bullish on OMG as I once was...
I previously owned 2500+ OMG and sold as I realized it was little more than a hype machine with few resultsMonero has been around since 2014 with no hype and has consistently made improvements and grown in valueI'd say long term Monero is the best hold in crypto outside of BTC
fucking bump

FluffyPonyWhy would anyone trust him after his little "joke"?
LOLhe did that to make a point about speculation in the crypto sphere and to further emphasize that unlike monero most every coin is riding on hype alone and little elsea point that was well made
