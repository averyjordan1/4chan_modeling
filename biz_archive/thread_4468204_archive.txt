I'm buying the dip.
It is similar situation to Loopring this September, when it was delisted on Binance.
Are u for real?
Have you noticed they deleted all their communication channels and their likedin profiles?
Its confirmed scam you fucktard
I went all in with 2BTC.
My initial investment in crypto was 500EUR.
All my hard work is gone
nice try JOOST
Sorry to hear that, anon.
lol.Loopring wasn't delisted because the team sucked.
Loopring requested to be delisted because of the Chinese government ban.
Its value dropped because of overall market forces, NOT the strength of the product.This shit's down because the Confido team are scam artists.
You people don't read between the lines..They had "Scam" written all over their asses from the get.. Their fucking ANN thread on bitcointalk had only 7 pages, with the dev's barely communicating.
Glad I figured out,when it's the best time to invest..don't ever fucking buy during an ICO.Buy when the token/coin is just being listed on the exchange and before being listed on coinmarketcap.Fuckin works for me.Just bought some TIO..check it out: 
all in on a single shitcoinyou deserved that.
I just bought 100k
