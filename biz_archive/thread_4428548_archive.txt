High risk investment, take a look.6.2m supply$40k market capAvailable on yobithttps://yobit.net/en/trade/ZYD/BTCOpinion;The Middle East is not yet tapped for blockchain tech but this is the next region to blow up.Most of West is in.
East is in.
Down under also.
So the MENA region is left almost entirely.There's a few projects already coming out, namely ArabianChain with DBIX, and Royal Kingdom Enterprises with RKC.But as more and more businesses show interest, I'm sure local money and governments will pour in as well with the first regional exchange recently launched too, PalmEx.So whilst on the surface the projects may look tacky, underdeveloped and not as polished as ICOs and projects we're used to seeing, as interest grows, we'll see an increase in professionalism and communication too.Comes to mind due to recent news but Antshares, first website and wallet didn't look as polished as they're now if you go back and take a look.That in mind, I came across ZYD, looks like the aim is to be the BTC/LTC of the region.Thinking long term, this could be a great opportunity to get in should this be the first main crypto the locals take up.I'm NOT telling /biz to invest, and again, this is a high risk move so DYOR, but I got a feeling about this project to take a flyer.
I mean, I'm down for diamonds in the rough, I like taking on high risk for high reward...
But how can you invest in a coin with $4 daily volume haha

This chart could be explained as.. initial investors found the project going too slow for them and loosing patience and dumping and abandoning.I still think when the region wakes up like in 2018 or even 2019, this could be one of the front runners.DBIX is an eth based platform.ZYD is the BTC or LTCHigh risk.
Long term.
