its all so tiring
Are you autistic?
Why the fuck are you even here?
>making a thread about your hidden threads
awww, triggered?
4257010its literally the same shill threads over and over again.
go through the catalog and you'll realise how bad it actually is.
i take a bit of time out of my day so when i refresh the catalog i can see the new threads that have potential otherwise they disappear into the sea of piss that is currently bizalso using filters can sometimes hide decent threads so i try to avoid thatyes
Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.
I sometimes stop by to see if anything interesting has appeared, but no.
the problem is that you'll have a look a few hours later and most of the filtered threads have disappeared, so i have to do it all over again
