what now
What does this mean?
Now we laugh at the BCH cucks getting dumped on by chinese scammers and exiled jews
Miners flock to BCH because it's more profitable, and BTC suffers from it.
Eventually people get fed up with either ridiculous fees and/or super long transaction times, and just move onto using something that actually works and has bitcoin in the name somewhere so it doesn't look like an alt coin.See what happens in couple days/weeks.
look at the picture again retard
bitcoin cash is bitcoin!
