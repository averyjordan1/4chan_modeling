>all korean exchanges are down>BCC is dropping>accumulate BCC>korean exchanges get back up and price skyrockets back up>sell accumulated BCC for profitsWe are all going to make it
Its almost too obvious.
XDDYou are not going to make it anonyou are getting JUSTed so hard right nowDon't sell though, keep holdingBuy even more if it goes up to 1800$ again
yeah i'm really doubting your step #4but i wouldnt be surprised by anything right now, and Jihan & Co. certainly have enough firepower to continue this for a while...but imagine being an average trader stuck in the middle of this storm and suddenly the site goes down.you're stuck on the sidelines watching other sites show massive red candles, your losing thousands and cant do a thing.first thing most common traders are going to do : exit as soon as possible

>Koreans try to PnD us>their exchange takes a shit right as the dump starts and they cant hit selllike pottery
