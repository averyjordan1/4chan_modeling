Is this shit ever gonna moon again?
I thought they were further ahead on development than Lisk?
Why does it always dump so hard when BTC is moving (more than other alt coins).
stratis doesn't have a product.
What about the breeze wallet?
Which is why you should be stacking up on it now.
There's also masternodes and tumblebit which are working.
Stratis and Lisk are nothing alike.
Better comparison would be to NEO who its behind, not that NEO is good either for that matter.
They still aren't done with that shit?
Goddamn
Scratch that I'm retarded and read 'are working on' in my head.
Do they have official releases or is it still just alpha shit?
Breeze in in beta now and works with Stratis and BTC from what I recall.
Masternodes are in alpha but seem to be working as intended and once t hey go live they will be able to incorporate tumblebit which will enable masternode's to earn BTC (and will make BTC transactions using the wallet completely anonymous).
Is NEO ready to launch ICO's?
Stratis will be by EOY I believe if they meet their targets.
How much for a masternode pls dev whwn air drop tnax
A Stratis masternode requires 250 000 Stratis coins (STRAT) to be regarded as compliant.
These coins should be kept in a single address, and should not be moved once the funding transaction is performed.
Holy fuck why did that half breed nigger make it sooo expensive?
I think they are working on smaller nodes too.
So whats a good amount to own?
1000?
Depends on whether you think it will go up or not, 1000 is not enough to make any meaningful return from staking though.
DYOR, but I feel like Stratis will be a successful project throughout next year.
They are doing an AMA series on reddit in a couple of days that may reveal some positive news.
