Is this dipping back to 16 cents or do I buy NOW
Probably more like 18 cents.
I would wait.
There's no news or any developments coming as far as we know
Buy now and holdOr listen to slick here and get fancy and fomo buy in later
It'll dip again.
It's still a scamcoin but EVERYTHING is up rn.
Even DGB.
as someone who bought at 0.17 and have since sold for profit + gained on other shit, i agree with this.
if it goes back up to fucking .24 or something i'll eat my hat, but i just don't see it until the fork is over.
looking for re-entry at 0.18 myself.
The fork is over.
a scamcoinPls.
buy now
FUCKING IDIOT FORK IS OVER YOU'RE TOO LATE
3000 sats is the new floor, barring some BTC news that makes all alts tank again
it's at 0.23 at the moment of your post... you must have a tasty hat
And yet bitcoin is still above 7k.
What do you think will happen to LINK when it starts picking up again?
LINK has no news or developments coming.
Bitcoin rising or one big LINK sell will easily drop LINK.
That, combined with the fake buy orders (check binance) means that it'll go down.
I'm still waiting on that correction to 5k.
Will probably sell then.
