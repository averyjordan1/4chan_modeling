Any thoughts on SpankChain?
I just hit EtherDelta today, and seems to be a promising concept.
Trying to get a bit more research done here.
Anyone know anything about this coin?
porno coins?x10000
is the coin SPNK or SPANK?
it's SPANK
>erc shitcoin>absolutely no need for existence>buzzwordsThanks joost got 100k
they have quite a bit of support though from the porn industry.
Janice Griffith is supporting them and they are in partnership with District0x.
Additionally they have a working product and staking will be available in Q1 of 2018.Honestly, that's not bad..
I was looking at it.
the name is eye catching for sure among a sea of new coins, otherewise, who knows?
Apparently sites charge 50% fees to performers.
THey just want 5%, plus no risk of chargebacks.
Seems like an improvement to me.
Its a shitcoinTheres a coin that was being shilled by some nice guys here a few days ago that is 100x better than this shit
Seems like a good thing for performers
