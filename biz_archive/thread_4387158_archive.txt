who else here feels physically ill when thinking about missed opportunities with crypto?In 2009/2010 my uncle told me to learn how to mine bitcoin, unfortunately I wrote him off as being a conspiracy theorist nutbag (which he was)Also, I remember when eth was being shilled hard on /biz/ and I thought it was just dipshit shills shilling a shitcoin
Now LINK is being shilled hard on /biz/ and you're probably just shitting on it.
Muh toilet memes.
Oh trust me, because of these missed opportunities I want to go all in on LINK but I know this is the coin that eats shit
>missed gold>missed silver>missed oil>missed aluminium>missed lithium>missed steel>missed dotcom bubble>missed housing bubble>missed stocks rising at ath>missed amazon>missed netflixgolly anon it feels like missed oppurtunities is a meme, at you should have killed yourself for all those missed oppurtunities
LINK>this is the coin that eats shitI see you still havent learned your lesson, kek.
This.

So I'm comfy and shit waiting for the BCHBTC stuff to really kick off.Tell me everything there is to know about IOTA from a hardcore technical perspective that will validate my perception that it's probably the optimal solution for nanotransactions going forward.
Um... no.
Why don't you just go to the foundation's website?!
I just re-bought into Link.
Sold my position at 10k SAT.
Re-buying after a successful short like that feels nice and fucking comfy.
