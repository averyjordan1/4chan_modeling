CORE SHILLS BTFOPAID PAJEET FUDDERS BTFOFLIPPENIIIIIIIIIIIINNNGGGGG

What goes up must come down.
Can't wait till the reversal trend happens and money starts flooding back in BTC, it will be glorious.
>mfw i was gonna go all in at .112 but chickened out
Can't wait for cash to hit near 0.25 again and then putter out like it always does
I bought at 0.08 and sold at 0.03 .
So you feel bad for me?
why would money leave the real bitcoin when it's still so cheap to go back to the bloated corecoin at $6500?
oh wait, $6400 now
>BCHEvery one know they are just trading it to make more BTC.
BitBean is faster and cheaper than bcash or bitcoin, it use proof of stake too.
It's dumping.
Enjoy being chinked.
