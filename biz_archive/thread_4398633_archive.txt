ABSOLUTE
BCH is probably not going to recover much but I think it still has one good solid pump left in it before it dies.
Wouldn't bet heavy on it but it's worth putting something small in just in case.
yes I too have some bags to offload
ok, seriously.
Are you guys just being sarcastic?
You mean... to make a move... downward spiral?!
Is this an invitation to 'BUY BUY BUY' because your bags got really heavy?
No, they're just panicked as fuck that they're going to permarekt if bcash returns to <$500.
You better put your life on it because a blockstream controlled BTC is a very grim future indeed
this.
the BCH pump is gonna hit so fucking fast, youre either on board or eating dust.
That's not how decimals work
