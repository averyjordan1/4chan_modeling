Is this gonna moon to GRS level?

Morale: Biz hates free bitcoins

was in at 1700, sold at 1800 some days ago... now it pumps to jupiter .... FML
The current board culture focuses more on fundamentals and holding rather than trading, hence the lack of signals or late signals.
This, first I'm hearing of it
no its not dumbass this shit was posted here at like 1200 sats when it would randomly moon to 2k+ but the threads got like 2 posts because people are retards
Why is it going up?
confirmed i was the one shilling this coin, it's a shame that i actually sold a day before it mooned
i was the one makin these "Feathercoin ?
Feathercoin !"
Threads with pic related.Everytime almost no one got in these threads and called me pajeet.Now i sold at 1800 before the moon.
sometimes HODL isnt just a meme lol
forgot pic related
I fucking called it when it was still at 0.14.
Nobody listened.
I was weakhanded and sold at 0.23, could've earned a lot more.
Picked up some cheap Vertcoin for it though.
Will move some remaining funds to GRS.
I think this FTC pump will not hold much longer.
i was talking about those 3 days.
