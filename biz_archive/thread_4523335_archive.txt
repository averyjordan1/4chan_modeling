Dont buy this trash
I'm going pretty big into ENJ for the simple fact that it is roughly 5x below the ICO price.
Every half-way decent shitcoin that goes so far below ICO to start always, always rises somewhat over the course of 1-3 months after the dip.
Like clockwork.
Even if this shit only goes back up to 8 cents (20% under ICO price) you're making well over triple returns.
It's not.
