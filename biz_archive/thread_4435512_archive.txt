It seems like most of /biz/'s favorite memecoins have a common feature in that they are not competing with other crypto projects, but instead are offering a service that makes all other crypto ventures better off.
ie:>ARK: Facilitates communication between chains>LINK: Facilitates communication between chains and the outside world>REQ: Sets up payment requests, doesn't actually get involved in payment itself so is fully compatible with OMG etc.What other coins are in this space?
They're not in some particular sector fighting a zero-sum fight against competitors, instead they're trying to make all crypto better for everyone.
> BTC: Goes up, everything goes up.
Actually when it goes up it sucks all the money out of alts usually.
This last bounce from $5500 has been atypical.
