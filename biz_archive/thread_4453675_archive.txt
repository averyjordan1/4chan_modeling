I don't report all the shit coin and ICO scams because I like watching people suffer.
shills have made me a shitton of money tipping me off to news and rumors i never would've found myself.
fuck off
So has just holding, yet I still made the mad gains without listening to scammers.But again... Keep doing that.
I like seeing people lose everything and posting red wojacks.
alright maybe outright shills for shitcoins are bad but its nice to know when something gets listed on binance or the whole neo tweet shit like that
If you're too stupid to get fooled by a scam on /biz/ then you don't deserve your money.
Let shills keep shilling- it's how we make it; sifting through the shit with our own judgement.
