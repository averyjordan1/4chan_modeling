Help, I don't want to sell anything.
But I do want to add fiat, around $500 every two weeks.
How should I go about buying new coins?
All in with every $500 on one coin?
Add to the lower coins?
Or spread out?
Last time I added I put $250 into REQ and then like $50 each into a few coins.
Ahhh
BCHETHLTCGet rid of Link itâ€™s a 4chan fad.
OMG is leveling at 5
Be ready to sell OMG soon and put it into COSS, also sell ebet and ark asap and put into coss or NEO (not even necessarily because they are bad coins but you have too little in them, put it all in a guaranteed good coin instead)
LINK agh, dump that shitcoin for ZAP, they actually have a product and kick ass roadmap for Oracles.
Where do you buy coins friend?
Everywhere Sometimes binanceSometimes etherdelta or bittrex or coss just depends on what I'm buying
I want good gainsI want to find the next eth.
I believe eth will go to 2k+ eventually but something like 0x or req will outpace it from hereWhy is everyone saying to sell omg?
