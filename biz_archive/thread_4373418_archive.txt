lol you showed us
yamero!
It makes me kek too but this board made me rich as fuck
trust me without /biz/ crypto would not have had nearly the boom it did.
you know how many P/D's were coordinated here.
how many slacks assembled.
how many coins we made into what they are.
butterfly effect in action
there are people on this board who believe thisYou're worse than /pol/ thinking they influenced the election
trust me without /biz/ crypto would not have had nearly the boom it did
/biz/ is the epicenter of the cryptoworld, you pleb.
If you browse here, then you are in the upper echelon of society.
How do you think the news spread?
/biz/ is an anime website that aggregates the news of the cryptoworld and from here, it spreads like wildfire to Discords, subreddits, Twitter, etc.
You expect me to believe a bunch of Nazi Neets and filthy indians made you rich?
kek trump only won because of /pol/
You underestimate our power
lol good one op
But it did, vastly, leftists were so sure they had full control on social medias and internet at large that when /pol/ came to shit everywhere and got the cool kids to meme for Trump that made them batshit crazy because their communication was super bland and stale.Just look how reddit had to tweak its algorithm to keep /r/TheDonald (which is basically a /pol/ colony) out of the frontpage because it triggered leftists super hard and how twitter and facebook went full purge on conservative accounts since he got elected.I made x50 already thanks to ANS and WTC, so yes definitely.People who flames the coins /biz/ shilled early are generally the ones too late to the party.At the end of the day you can't research every single project and you have to consult hubs like /biz/ to augment your chances.
Imagine being this retarded
filthy ?
no , but thanks to shit board i made 50k thanks to ETH being shilled
unironically fucking kill yourself
you drink cow urine your opinion doesnt matter
well yes, because pol did influence the election, they spawned t_d and shook the memeosphere to its core
feels>reals
This board is a parodyJust like /pol/Most people are aware of this, some just don't realize it and actually think that the posts are meant serious

Imagine being a bitter leftist poorfag, oh wait you don't because you are.
Im a fascistthe things you said were just retarded
this kills the thread
