Anyone buying/holding right now is out of their mind.
Get out now.
Final warning
Everyone's been saying this for months.
Worst case scenario you'll still profit if you're willing to hold long enough.That said, if anyone has all their savings in crypto they should think about how much risk they're really willing to accept and how long they can lock their cash away for
I ain't fucking selling
Bitcoin is way past this meme now.Media is starting to grow fond of it, and suddenly many of my normie teachers had heard of it
I've got about 5% of my savings in crypto but my butthole still puckers with the ebb and flow of the marketthat said, anyone who sells their stack because of threads like this is a fucking moron
it's what they said at 1kit's what they said at 3kit's what they said at 6kit's what they're gonna say at 8kit's what they're gonna say at 10knot today

that graph is for a traditional stock.
bitcoin is a technology.>lrn2 to technological adoption>exponential growth on S-curve
Yes BTC will always recover but not for a while.
The high has been reached for the fake B2X fork.
We're on our way back to ~$5500
End your life.
that image keeps growing, lol.i wonder why 
I'm not saying BTC won't eventually recover.
It always always will.
Not trying to worry holders, but if you're a trader get out now.
that's why you go into alts.>buy alts at BTC top>sell alts at BTC bottom>wat for BTC to recover>repeateasy accumulation tactic for bitcoin, of course you have to be a bit smart about which altcoin you choose

If you have more than 10% of your net worth in crypto, you deserve all the emotional pain that is assuredly coming in your direction once this shit crashes through the floor.
