Not investing in anything where the github is complete trash, soz
Where is WTC's github?
I'm not investing in WTC either lul.
Besides, I'd rather put money in something that has no github instead of a project whose github is literally an actual joke.
Have you even looked at the NULS github?
Every line just returns "null"
WHO GIVES A SHIT IF THEY FOLLOW REGULATION, THEY ARE NOT GOVERNMENT SUPPORTED PPL WHO BUYING IN FOR THIS ARE GOING TO GET FUCKED HARD
