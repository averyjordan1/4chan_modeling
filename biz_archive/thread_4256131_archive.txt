Norman checking in.Have 4400 USD in Gemini.
Dumped link at 315 a few hours ago (bought at 295).
Feels good, man.Now where do I put this 4400 while waiting for the next buy in?
You guys have told me to get my coins / cash off the exchanges as soon as Im down trading.
I use MEW for ETH and Electrum for my BTC bag, but where do I sent actual USD?The only exchanges Im registered on are Gemini (duh) and Bitstamp.
Is that what this whole 'tether' term means?
Can do this on either of those exchanges and if so, what walled will hold these tether coin things?Thx /biz
