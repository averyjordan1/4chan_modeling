I have a newbie question related to timezones and trading.
Let's take an example of POWR right now.
It's morning in the EU and volume is already high as fuck, will it be even higher when the Americans wake up?
Or will they see it as a missed opportunity and won't bite in?What about Asia?Can someone clear this up for me?

Volume will vary depending on the time in different regions, yes.
However, volume is not indicative of a high or low price.
Please read the question.
I'm not asking about what hour is in America or Asia lol.I see, but given the POWR example where it went up for 100% in last 24h and before nothing for months.. Wouldn't that indicate to people that wake up it is a missed train?
I don't see poeple jumping into 100%, even though the product is good.Is this too big of a jump for a day, or it makes sense after months of nothing, news came out and now it's going to take off.I mean, yes, I'm answering my own questions kind of, but is there anyone with more experience and bigger brains out there to clarify stuff.In terms of daytrading I understand we are looking at patterns and trading them, which influence the price.
But this is more than just a pattern and shilling,I think?
