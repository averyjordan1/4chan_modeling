So essentially they were claiming to do what Chainlink wants to do or am I missing something being the newfag I am.
Its in the fucking name holy shit...
>mfw I was going to put thousands of dollars into this coin a mere HOUR before the news hit, but decided not to at the last minute
but decided not to at the last minuteWhat changed your descision?
They were claiming to use chainlink to do what paypal does.
What annoys me about this is their idea is so simple yet they scammed with it.They were going to let ChainLink parse the APIs from UPS/Fedex/etc.
Then they were going to just have an App that tapped into ChainLink to get the status of a package.
Then once its delivered, release coins held by the App in multi-sig wallet to the seller.Like jesus christ, they could have just spent $5k and had an outsourced dev team create a shitty version of it.
I researched the ICO price and discovered that it was already something like x12 despite not having a working product.
Nope.
Still fairly complicated.#1.
How do you get access to FedEx api?#2.
How do you make/get access to a signature system?#3.
No clue what type of operating system those hand held signature devices use, somehow your app has to run on that.
Then is has to somehow access the blockchain?IDK m8 that sounds like more than 5k to me.
Good job
Isn't this an inferior version of what Modum is doing?
