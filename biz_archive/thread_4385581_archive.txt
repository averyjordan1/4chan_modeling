Buying Monero seems hard, how do I buy it the right way?
If I use shapeshift wouldn't that leave behind a bitcoin paper trail?
Once you're in Monero the trail ends.
If you don't want anyone knowing you bought Monero then use localmonero.co
I just bought it through Bittrex, pretty upset it dropped 10% over night though.
Zencash is going to FUCK monero.
I was all in monero but now I'm all in zencashI made some money with monero but monero is definitely not going to last
Verge is King

Shapeshift tracks users and works with US agencies at request, look at the work they did on catching the randomware guys recently.
Not to be trusted with anything connected to you.
If you use Shapeshift make sure you transfer to a wallet you own, before transferring to a different wallet you own, before transferring anywhere you want to use it.
Then it is truly anon.
government still can use undercover agents to track these transactions.
be careful.
I wish I wasn't a beta cuck and I could bang one of those girls.
Hopefully through crypto I'll be able to hire a hooker that looks like that.
Well it doesn't fucking matter anyway, does it?
The trail ends when you obtain the Monero.
