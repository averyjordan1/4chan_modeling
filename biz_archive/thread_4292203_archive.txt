Just as long as you got 2FA setup.

tfw a fucking secret russian ABC agency is trying to steal your NEET memecoins
and they work all day on it.
My Wordpress website has been under attack ever since I launched it.
I think it's normal.Most of the login bots have a comparable fingerprint.
So I manually blocked them after a couple months.
Just looked up the stats.
I already blocked 36546 hits from that guy alone now.
I used my work e-mail for coinbase.
You need a physical code generator to log onto that e-mail.
They can't get through that, r-right?
I also have a huge problem with bots using Amazon servers trying to find exploits.
Two factor verification should work in most cases.When you enable two factor verification on Yahoo they allow you to recover your password with just a phone number, turning it into a one factor authentication again.
Which is ridiculous.
tfw I've hacked the crypto accounts of about 5 anons from /biz/ and see this thread
