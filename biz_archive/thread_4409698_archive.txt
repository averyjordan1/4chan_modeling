What's the best exchange for UK?
I hear anything actually based in UK is fucked, so I need an exchange which deals with tethered Euros, right?Want to make sure I can pull the trigger and exchange Bitcoin to Euro if things turn tits up (or play around with other alt-coins)
kraken

And then either that or Bittylicious to sell.
Kraken has real bad review score on the first site that popped up for me.You can't sell instantly on those platform though, right?
You have to basically respond to an advert, wait for their response, then enter Escrow, and then the money comes out of the system - I want to be able to keep it in the system, with tethered Euros (since taxes and charges for withdrawing/ purchasing Bitcoins with FIAT, rather than trading between tethered Euros/ USD and cryptocoins).. right?
UK bank->revolut - bank transfer to coinbase - transfer to gdax for no feesReverseGdax - coinbase - eu bank - revolut - UK bank
Coinfloor m8.
You can cash out as £ and avoid foreign exchange fees.
Revolut isn't an EU bank.
But can you use it like that?
I know kraken doesn't accept revolut
4409976Works for sending money to coinbase not getting it back from btcI know you can retrieve through fire app and send it to revolut, or just use localbitcoins
Try binance.
They are actually much better than Kraken, but you also have to be careful because they are in Hong Kong so who knows if you will get justed some down the line.
This, you can open a euro bank account for free and move pounds to euros and then send it to Kraken.
By far the easiest and cheapest option.
Just cashed out £200k via coinfloorI don't get why nobody seems to know about it
