Is anyone else following the breakout, looking like a 10% day today.
Already up 10% from yesterday, not sure about it going higher.
The bullish trend is definitely still intact and with the HF for BCH being a non-event yesterday price wise I think the money is going to slowly flow back into Alts now
Just bought back on this little dip for 100 extra Iota.
Let's see what happens now.
