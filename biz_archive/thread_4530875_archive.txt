Done with crypto here's my private key with a ton of tokens.
My wife's son is making me quit crypto since I don't spend enough time working.049bb603adbd99a8a00aeef83d2ceacc3f2958cd927f7295188ae43cbeb09df9Gotta be fast.
GTFO with this Pajeet scam.
Can anyone figure out how to get the tokens out of it?
It automatically forwards any ETH received so I can't pay the token transaction fees.
If you send him ETH you are an idiot
Buy Cuckoin and your wifes son will not mind if you trade cryptos
