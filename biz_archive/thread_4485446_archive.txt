This is not crypto bubble time.
This is dollar crisis time.
It's the dismantling of the euro-petro-dollar global dominance.
Venezuela collapsed, Saudi Arabia is shooting its own princes out of the sky for money laundering, Zimbabwe is impeaching Mugabe for the same crime.Dirty cash, US dollars, and oil revenues are inextricably linked, and they are all being taken down, all over the globe.
There are no crypto bubbles - the US dollar is dying before our very eyes.And do you know why we aren't recognising it?
Because we are sitting here, waiting for the television news report to show us the revolution.Even when we're smart, we are idiots.Anyway, buy whatever the fuck you like, lads.
Just make sure it's crypto, and I think we're all going to make it.
Don't forget that Russians are now trading with the Chinese in direct Ruble/RMB.It is important to note that Brazil's Oil Market is opening it self to foreign companies.
Not that Brazil's reserves are near as rich as Venezuela's or the kebab's ones, but national capacity to extract it as deep-sea is remarkable and for sale, which means the crude resource can be exploited at ease.
I think it all depends how bad is going to be the upcoming crisis.
If it's gonna be the worst of them all (and there is a chance for that, since there was no crisis in around 8 years while they usually are every 6-7 years).
If the crisis is gonna be really bad, than those which won't have enought fiat money, will retrieve their coins, which will make crypto go down the sewer.
But if it's not gonna be that bad, we might actually have one of the best flights to moon.What do you think about it guys?
God damnit dude tell these goys to buy bitcoin, most of those alts are based in countries who's economies will suffer from TOTAL collapse.
Btc is the only asset besides PM's that will go up during total collapses
