Can this fucking shit stop already?
Every single time I finally see a my alts recovering and my portfolio going up 0.5 BTC in value, some greedy piece of fucking shit with nothing of value to offer the community has to come along and either artificially pump their outdated, lazy-normie-get-rich-quick coin (BTC) or create some pseudo-improvement fork (BCH, BTG).And what to do if you don't trust Tether?
Can't even protect my alt gains with BTC tanking and not trusting this manufactured flippening bullshit one bit either...
WHEN THE FUCK WILL IT STOP?!
HOW IS ANY INNOVATION GONNA HAPPEN IF GOOD COINS HAVE TO EVENTUALLY DIE DUE THIS FUCKING SHIT?!
Thinking about hodling my quality alts for 6 months and deleting my Blockfolio.
IF GOOD COINS HAVE TO EVENTUALLY DIEno good coin is dying just BTC
