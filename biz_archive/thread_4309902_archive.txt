I think it is ironic that people often say ethereum doesn't resemble a currency, because I think it does moreso than BTC.
Currencies are usually issued by banks or government, and most of the time as loans which you have to pay back with interest, though the government also issued them through spending and receives them back as taxes (activity going back to Mesopotamia, where kings would use currency to subjugate people by making them indebted to the king in his token).Ethereum reverses the normal issuance of the currency.
Instead of a central authority, the currency is issued by those in the market to the ICOs, who then turn and sell it for cash.
That latter aspect resides outside the ethereum system itself so it isn't totally self-reliant, but setting that aside.
The bag holders expect a higher return on the ethereum they put in.
Dividends in ethereum could help with strengthening this cycle, but right now that is legally suspect.
As it stands the tokens bought with ethereum often don't promise you anything in return, which really makes them just the speculative dead end.
People are just pumping money into companies for their own funny tokens, which could have no utility at all.
ETH is at its top, there are new smart contracts platform coming in the future with more and better features.I refuse to believe them at will stay at the top just because people like autistic faggots like Vitalik.
That would easily make this the best christmas in a while.
