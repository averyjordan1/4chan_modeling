I've been away from crypto because of work and school but what does the cancelling of Segwit2x mean for BTG?
Is it dead now or does it just mean it's activation is delayed?
Or does it mean it's cancelled all together?
>pic related is me, go easy
Please help
PLEASE
It is still there but irrelevant
So in other words it's just a shit coin now?
i dont believe its up and running yet, its still at testnet stage afaik... you can only trade futures atm
I have 1.5 BTG futures and I only bought them because they were ~$90 when I bought them.
I know absolutely nothing about BTG but I knew that I would probably never see them for that cheap anytime soon.
Up around 120% in one week so I'm not doing too bad.
