What the fuck is Bitcoin Diamond?
Seems to have come out of nowhere, just saw the posting on Binance.
It looks like a legit project, could this be the fork that finally kills Bitcoin?
Anyways is it safe to say we should stay out of alts until the fork block tomorrow?
MORE BLOCKS - PUT EVERYTHING INTO BINANCE
Honestly I agree, I could see this shit mooning and it seems literally nobody knows about it.I'm sure Bittrex will retroactively hand it out if it is big assuming they can get a block snapshot at the time.
I haven't seen an official policy on it...
Bump.
Just sold a lot of of my alts for it, hope the block speeds pick up the pace since I'm gonna have to stay up all night until the fork so I can buy back in.
