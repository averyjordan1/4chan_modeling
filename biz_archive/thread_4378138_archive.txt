Got justd on this
this is just a dumb idea.
Aviation companies will develop blockchain strategies internally if they need them.nobody is ever gonna use this garbage coin, like most the crap on binance
This doesnâ€™t stop the pump.
Just make sure to exit before the dump.
I think this money has a real value and a strong team.
I have bought 0.5btc of ARN and I'm going to hold it till end of december.
Pretty sure the hype will come soon !
What's the problem of private blockchain ?Yes !
Exactly !
You're right !It's not a true decentralized solution and you just have to know servers location to break it !public blockchain is the future and organizations are just waiting ot to be proven
And you don't know anything about other binance coins, that's obviousFUD is FUD
fucking love this one.
$6m market cap... one big announcement/partnership and this will moon again
This is seriously the stupidest idea.
No arguments, nothingOpinion discarded
THIS IS GOING TO FUCKING MOON
