what you think of blockcat ?
Unironically $10 EOY after they release their new website this month and start the beta.
With binance listing coming too this will be huge.
Was gonna buy this, bought xby instead lmao
I like the way they do everything properly, they don't rush to get on exchanges, they go through with the compliance and do it all right.
They won't have any disasters in the near future because of this.Also, the idea has the potential to be absolutely groundbreaking.
I believe in the future there will be contractors working as "BlockCAT consultants" and the like.
Making smart contracts accessible to the masses will genuinely, actually, change the world.
Buying every time it dips below $0.80.
I think this is a $5 or $10 coin in the near future.

Wish I bought that succulent dip a couple weeks ago.
Feel bad for anyone who is still holding since $5 for whatever reason, but I think it still has potential once they finally get all the furniture put together at the office.
Been holding since it was first shilled here.
Still think it has potential to go to $10 if they get it on more exchanges.
I could be wrong though.
Nuls could be the real deal and dump this rotting shitcoin into a ditch.
> new website Lmao
You are not wrong.
Just wait till next month.
