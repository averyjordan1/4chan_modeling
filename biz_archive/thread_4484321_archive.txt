Would you prefer it if bitcoin died, the market went to the gutter for 6 months but ethereum took over?
Hope it all dies so I can pick up some on the lowest dip, and wait 5 years when it roars sky high again just before the next scam ends.
bitcoin died months
Vitalik has too much influence over Ethereum, I don't want something like that to take over.
do you really think vitalik isn't preferable to the clowns that run btc and bch?
/threadif bitcoin and bitcoin cash die we will see another nuclear crypto winter that might never end
Lmao, no.
but ethereum took overFuck no.
Let's have a decentralized coin actually designed around being a currency become the new king
Bitcoin needs to be around and maintaining healthy growth until the late adopters hop in at least you stupid ghost dork.
