WTC about to moon.
DYOR and all that but just check it out.
It's pretty clearly about to go off.
Have you seen ShipChain too?
I think it ICOs next year
wannabe wabi coin
In since $0.80 - most comfy hold.
Average buy price is still only $2.14.Even when it dips to sub $4.50 I'm still up 2x.Can't wait for my favorite chink coin to hit double digits by Jan/Feb.WTC will be $15+ by Q2 mark my nigger words coming out of my huge nigger lips.
Wabi coin has no usage and they are targeting B2C, while Walton targets B2B.
