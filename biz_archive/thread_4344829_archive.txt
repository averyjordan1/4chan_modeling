I shunned this coin for so long...........what a little research does for the mind.
Shhh.
Wallet release by end of 2017
OMFG A WALLET WOWJUST BOUGHT 10000000000000K
everything this coin can ever achieve is already priced in.
there is only the way down for now.
Better get something that does the same for a different target group and which is still undervalued
you will be rewarded anon.
Nice skateboard meme coin, nigger.
FIRST A SKATEBOARD, NOW A WORKING WALLET!
?FUCKKK, THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH AT LEAST 2 BILLION IN MARKET CAP
yeah if you hold this for 2-3 years and the team delivers you might actually see some gainsor you know... you could just buy more BTC and get guaranteed gainsof course thats not autistic enough for biz
yeah if you hold this for 2-3 years and the team delivers you might actually see some gainsNot a chance.
The longer this project takes to deliver anything, they will be devoured by more aggressive players in the same space.REQ is already carving out their market share, and appears to be a more serious team with bigger backing than the 12-restaurant behemoth that is the McDonald's franchise in Thailand.
I'm holding REQ and OMG long term.
Got into both low.
Shhh dont tell them
The price is going up alot right now because it just released on the china marketplace just moments ago
1 billion market cap>Pretending it's some secretLarper please.
This shit is past its expiry date.
Great choice.
I dont really do altcoins, OMG and REQ are my only holdings except BTC and ETH and XMR
HAHAHAYou don't even know shit about OmiseGo.
It is not a coin yet, it is a token on the ETH network.
REQ is literally the biggest joke ever.
Enjoy your bags retard
