Congratulations, there is literally about 100s of sites offering this already.BitwalaWB21CoinsbankXapoUquidAdvcashCryptopayCoinizySpectropayBitpaybitnovoShiftWorldcoreMoneypoloWirexANXRock TradingDSXBitstampWagecanGetonebitBitnationSatoshiTangoBitfinex + Blade paymentsPlutusCryptobuyerShakepayCapitalist.netunichange.... and the list goes on....
TenX had VISA already, it exploded because they got new deal with VISA with better conditions.Top crypto->fiat card atm imho.
TenX can issue their own cards which makes them independent from "issuance services" such as WaveCrest or Prepaid solutions.
Monaco does not have this opportunity since they also use Wave Crest for this.
TenX is one of a kind indeed.
I would call Spectrocoin the leader atm since they also recently started to give customers their own IBAN and now this is challenging
