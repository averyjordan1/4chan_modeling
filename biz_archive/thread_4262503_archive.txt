How does this one compare to SALT?
Doesn't launch till April and only in SA?
great question.SALT lending and the salt token will be used to help crypto investors monetize their holdings (i.e.
borrow against their portfolio) and I think SALT's application will be more geared toward making more speculative based investments in crypto.
it's not p2p consumer credit like RCN.RCN's utility is driven by the democratization of credit markets and their native token is used as a bridge currency that would permit lenders and borrowers to transact indirectly.
RCN's cherry is their co-signer system that would migrate all or partial credit risk (loss from borrower default) from the lender to a local agent that would guarantee the loan.
THIS IS CALLED LOCALIZATION.
as a lender you're interested in a yield that is superior to a certificate of deposit because those are a joke.
imagine being a US resident and enjoying yield from a borrower in an emerging market or a group of borrowers from an emerging market.
it'll most definitely trump any domestic fixed income security because rates in emerging markets are usually higher than developed countries (which assume lower risk premiums).
but hey OMG has Mcdics in thailand.
and they don't even have a working product yet.
maybe i should put my money in that.
