OK if pump's over, why are BOTH Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash bleeding atm?
because they're both shit
theyre both trading sideways not bleeding, also koreans are sleeping
People are losing trust since the shitshow is taking too long.
Move to stable alts and wait till either btc or bch dies.
Can this meme die already?
Traders don't sleep
They're both losing, especially BTC, below 6100 atm on Bitfinex
you forgot alts.
alts are bleeding too.
everything is bleeding.
exit all crypto markets
BBRAAAAAAPPP!!!
Bitcoin is ranging rather safely despite all odds, I don't know what the fuck is happening.
I want to lick her feet
What a stupid question!
bitcoin has actually shown great resilience so far, might get out stronger out of this.
