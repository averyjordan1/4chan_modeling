This feels worse than being dumped on.
You made positive.
Keep making positive trades and your make it.
Don't be greedy.
Also it's your fault for selling your entire position.
Good lesson.
Question: if I sell half or part for profit, does that mean I should increase the size of my initial buy?
NEO IS NOT A PND SHITCOIN LIKE BCH YOU FAGGOT JUST BUY BACK AND HOLD IT FOR A MONTH DONT TRY TO DAYTRADE AND YOU WILL HAVE SICK GAINS
clarify this
Question: if I sell half or part for profit, does that mean I should increase the size of my initial buy?you should buy long term when it's cheap and not mooningand buy short term at the breakout
Yes, ofcourse.
You want to make sure your gains outweigh your losses when you pull out early.
Set a profit stop on the portion you wish to safe and a stop loss on the portion you're willing to risk.
I guess I should stop trading on exchanges that don't offer stop losses.Yes, I used short term trading strategies when I actually got in pretty low.
Good to recognize that.
