Kek, you think that would be a big gain?/biz/ was shilling $3 Ethereum and $.20 Ark a year ago and 6 months ago, respectively
SHOULD I BUY LINK NOW???
TELL ME I DONT WANT TO MISS ANOTHER MOON MISSION AAAAAAAAA
Yes
Don't buy link, dude.
They're retarded bagholders who bought a Yobit-tier shitcoin.
I did then sold to buy nulls one day before it mooned and nulls crashed 40%
so I assume you're now a multimillionaire after having followed all those great /biz/ advices.
the fact of the matter is that every good /biz/ advice, i can tell you at a dozens that are pajeet scams.
sometimes it's easy to spot the good ones, other times it's not
*for every*at least a dozen>tfw just got home half-drunk
Wipe off your tears anon, you think this thing has stopped mooning?Grab my hand and let's ride this shit.
