I have mostly alts under the BTC market on bittrex(BAY, STORJ, RLC, and a few more).
Since these alts sell for BTC, if bitcoin cash becomes the real bitcoin does the value of my alts also decrease substantially?
dude it isint gonna happen.
chinks will dump soon.
you think a shitcoin will just replace what's withstood the test of time?
fucking idiot you are op christ
It's a hypothetical question you fucking brainlet
No you moron because you can transfer your alts to another wallet or another exchange.Just because you bought your ark with bitcoin doesn't mean you have to sell it for bitcoin.
Thank you for clarifying, I just wasn't sure if the BTC value was the actual value.
It makes sense now thanks
the market will decide honestly nobody knows.
if people panic sell all their alts to jump on bch everything is going to be reset.
scary times this is why you diversify into the big boys
If the flippening does occur the exchanges could always create new trading pairs with BCH.
Also most ERC20 tokens can be traded for ETH.
Ah okay so then it's not that big of a deal in the long run if you're alt heavy.
Bitbay holderYou're going to make it my friend.
what a brainless faggot, all alts shits would be added as new trading pairs what ever the top 2-3 boys.
no worries.
Thanks bro.
I believe BAY will be huge in a year or so.
The next ebay IMO.Makes sense now.
I was just unsure as I'm relatively new to this.
