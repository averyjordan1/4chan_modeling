No, you're just autistic.
Go jerk off and don't check blockfolio after.

Weak hands are born of impatientce.
this is pretty much my life except add in that i finally had the courage to approach a girl i've wanted to ask out for a long time, seemed to have a good conversation, exchanged numbers, texted for awhile (over a few days) and now I'm checking my phone every 20 minutes to see if she text me back but nothing in about 10 hours.
i feel autism.
