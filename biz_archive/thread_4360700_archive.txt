Doge is more of a coin than BCH dude.
yeah i guess so
yeah, it has pairings in a lot of exchanges, and transactions are fast and basically free too
Its pretty much free to trade using it, I always use it when liquidating coins
this
Doge is a store of value.
I'm still holding 7 million doge.
It has memetic powers that no other coin will touch likely ever.
Pretty much thisThere's really few 2013 altcoins that have kept so much volume since thenAnd basically none got to second place on market cap Best of it every year there's a pump sometime that you can easily short for gainz so easy even the utmost brainlet can ride
