Guys any Tether Exchanges have 100x leverage?
Look at that chart and the green lines are the USD value and are so predictable that it seems like easy money.
If no exchanges exist for Tether are there any other predictable currencies that have a chart like this?
>allow people to trade tether at 100x>everyone buys at 99 cents at 100x because sure thing>bitcoin dips, tether prints more tether to keep the bitcoin scam going>TETHER DIPS AGAIN>BLOWS THROUGH 95 CENTS AND THE 100XS THAT WERE THERE, CHAIN REACTION PANIC CLOSING>BIGLY LIQUIDATIONS>MARKET WIDE PANIC
Not that much different then it is now.
Whales are probably trading this thing with millions daily for 1-2% daily gains.
the point is that each one is supposed to be backed by actual USD buying power and not USD at leverage...even though they aren't redeemable for USD outside of a specific trading pairit would be interesting to see what USDTs would trade at if there were dozens more fiat gateways opened to trade against it, as it is conceivable that the price is fixed by kraken and bitfinex if you put your tinfoil hat on, but I am not the big money that deals with it so I'm mostly just talking out of my boyhole
So other then Tether are there any other predictable Cryptocurrencies that go up and down in a predictable manner?
the weed related coins seem to be the target of a few pump groups but aside from that you can always make the market for nubits, but also any low volume coin that you can afford to buy up a bunch of + you believe has potential
Seems that nubits is only available on bittrex.
nigga are you high ?
This ain't a forex discussion.
What would be better is something the trades predictably against BTC.
