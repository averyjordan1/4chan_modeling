Reminder to follow this chart unless you want to give some poo man from Indian your money.
90% of /biz/ IPs are from India.
Notice how /biz/ always tells you what altcoins to buy, but they never tell you when to sell your altcoins before its too late?
Thats the same way "stock news" timeslots on news channels work.
They say what to buy for the most part, rarely ever saying to sell.
Agreed.
