Hold out brother, if you've seen the recent announcements and updated roadmap Obsidian is fine.
There was an obvious pump and pressure when this first dropped on an exchange, but it is growing as it needed to grow.
This isn't some NULS bullshit.
DELUDED ODINS

About 1BTC deep in ODN and asking myself the very same question every day.
Even on major altcoin recovery days this shit does not move in the slightest.
over 1.5 btc here at around 11k sats just waiting till the app comes out at this point.
we are either deluded or smart money haha
staking 15k on my computer.

this coin WILL make it.
the problem with u niggers is impatience
you better say this shit to bitshares, eos, icn, siacoin and dgb holders.not every shit is about patience.
