IOC has begun to pump.
Predictions on how far the ultimate Chadcoin will run this time?
Predictions for 2020?When do we break $100?
I say before 2019
 hours a day work for 2 years> Robust and long regression testing>Can't even get the wallet to be working properly, enable staking button still an issue since wallet releaseLook I love IOC and all but this shit can be easily avoided by releasing the wallet on selected member before launching.
Hmm ok so good project but still stumbling potheads at the moment.
I'll keep the faith for now.
Plus their telegram group isnâ€™t open for opinionated discussion.
Its pretty sad.
Fud all you want, this is going to be big.
Agreed.
DIONS is soon isn't it?
The volume has been so low lately.
I'm holding about 300.
I had double that but sold half my stack a couple months ago.
I really don't think DIONS will pump it much higher, the recent pump is pricing in of it.
$5 next year if we're really really lucky.
Team is too tight lip about the future development and plans.
Will pump and then bleed out slowly after DIONS.

It's over guys, this got deleted seconds after being posted but I manage to sell at 36K.
