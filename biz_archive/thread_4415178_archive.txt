>tfw all you had to make were basically 2 trades this year to be as rich as Donald Trump (in terms of BTC)Buy everything in crypto in January of 2017.Short everything in crypto in July of 2017.Who knew it was this easy?
>tfw there's an infinite number of sequences of trades that could have made you rich in no time yet you're still poor even though you've been in the game for almost a full year
>buy some shit>it goes up slightly >dump>it moons 6 months laterI have the weakest hands
Well no shit.But the point is there were just 2 trades, really, that you had to make.My way is easier.
>Buy 10 BTC in January>Buy DGB at 35 satsBoom multimillionaire
Same.
I sold a fuckton of ETH around $40-$50.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
Then I went holy shit bought more at $80 and sold around $105.
Then I FINALLY went and bought a lot more at $390.Just fuck me up I did it backwards.
That 10 BTC was only about $8000 then too.
Shshshut up I sold 2 million dgb for 30 sats, literally weeks before it never came back down.
Its painful to know $500 would of turned to $100k.
Are women the real reptilians?
After this app I feel like I have been living in a deception.
At least you gave me a good laugh dont worry eth will break 400
