yes, these are all wet dreams of neo holders.
at best we'll see bithumb.
And we call the Linkies fucking deluded.
These rumors are 100x more impossible kek.

NEO miningThat's not a thing you idiot.
NEO is used to essentially mine GAS
Anytime anyone mentions 'mining NEO' it automatically discredits anything else they've said.
