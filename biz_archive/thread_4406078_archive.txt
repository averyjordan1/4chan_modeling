Was on the "your id is the crypto u invest in" thread (), and some dude rolled with the ID VLS.
I googled it, turns out this coin just finished it's crowdsale on nov 11th, will be listed on exchanges soon.
enables actual purchases of actual goods and services using their ERC20 token "VLS".
This could be a major competitor for chaintrade, and looks to be a sleeper hit.
I'm waiting for news of new coins on etherdelta or binance, because I sure as hell would like to get my hands on this thing while it's still under $1What does /biz/ think?
