Sup /biz/ any accountants in here?
Just interested what would happen if you were 12 months late to pay taxes?
I've heard that you will be charged extra 5% of the tax you owe as a penalty, anyone can give me more information, studying UK tax laws.
Bank base rate plus 2.5% - so 3% interest.
£100 late filing penalty£10 daily penalty for max of 90 days5% 6 months late5% 12 months lateAll added together You dun goofed
You dun goofedI didn't just wondering how hard you can fuck yourself up by forgetting such things.So in theory it would be 900 pounds + 100 pounds + extra 10% on the tax you owe?
