I hope this clears up all the FUD.
Last time my transfer was Clearex in kess than 12h.
Sens $$$ to Coinbase, buy BTC / ETH, transfer to Binance, exchange for NULSHo≈Çd.
What a post.
I'd use coinbase but it's fees are too high.
Paxful says they have instant wire transfers though and there fees are low for it.
fukcing nuls, the name cracks me up.
if you want a 50% gain then look no further than ETHclassic fag
