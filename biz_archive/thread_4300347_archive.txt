3 months ago I had 4k, and now I have 4k.
Manlets, when will they ever learn?

Damn legitimately how does it feel knowing that if you stopped trading and held that for a couple more years, you'd be very wealthy?

>inb4 some over-sensitive redditor comes in here and starts complaining about /pol/ after seeing OP's pic
Hur dur I could be a fucking trillionaire too if I could predict the future.

People who say things like that make me laugh.
"You could done this and doubled your m money."
I've made like 1k in 3 months, but it's not worth it.
The mission was to get rich investing in altcoins but it always backfired.
I'm thinking about quitting but i'll never forgive myself if btc moons to 50k or something.
Maybe just hodl and forget about it?
I can't though...
/pol/ is a fucking cancer, but what the fuck does this have to do with it?
literally no one willing to frequent 4chan would be butthurt over this pic, faggot
dude .....
Because every time there's a pic that can even be slightly construed as being /pol/-related, some fag comes in here saying "go back to /pol/", and then the thread gets derailed with people arguing with him.
I'm surprised you haven't seen this before.
I see it like twice a week.
A few days ago it was a screenshot of youtube commentors typing in bad english.
I think it's one butthurt fag who does scrolls the catalog looking for shit to be offended by.
