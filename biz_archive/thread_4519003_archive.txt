Will ETH ever get into the $1,000 - $10,000 bracket?
Yeah but not for a while.
The market cap would need to be huge for that to happen, ETH would need to be super well established by that point, and functional dapps that people want to use.
It's reaching 400 before you can even stake it and lots of important services and platforms are launching in 2018 that will massively increase the demand for Ethereum to pay for transactions on all these.Unless casper has a bug that fucks up everything it's going to moon like hell in 2018, maybe even christmas 2017 if casper (proof of stake) comes then.
