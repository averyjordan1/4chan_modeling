Where can I buy liquor for cheap?
I need to buy cheap Alchohol bottles, many at a time in bulk.Issue is, I live in washington.
Alch tax up the ass.Where can I buy super cheap spirits?
Preferably Smirnoff or svedka type type Alchohol at the worst, but if it's less than 14 a bottle after tax and relatively good then that's perfect
Germany.
What company in germany?
Wdym specifically?
How many we talking?
Might be able to buy bulk online somewhere.
Depends on price after tax.
Looking to spend a max of 100 for around 15 bucks a bottle.
Repeating sale tho.
Been looking around and can't find anything better than just going to the store
Youâ€™re pretty fucked, alcohol is heavily regulated by the states.
Unless you know a black market source you have to go through in state distribution channels and pay tax.
Best you can do is buy from a wholesaler, although you may need a license to get wholesale prices.
It's because we took care of the other thing, OP.
Just smoke weed, cheaper than booze here.Love from North bend
