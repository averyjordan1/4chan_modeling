So, having a professional background in FX I've decided to check out what's the fuss about this binary options thing.
In a day, on a demo account, I've made 150% of the "initial" investment following the same core strategies and instincts from my previous job.Why exactly is it considered to be a scam?
Of course there's an element of gamble I assume, since you can't predict some irrational fundamental movements (that's why I have a ticker with upcoming events opened on second screen), but besides that it's extremely easy money making if you know what you're doing.Yes, I know that this is pretty much the same thing as if I opened CFD's on high leverage, but while CFD's are less risky, they wouldn't provide such a big payoff for selecting the proper upcoming market direction.
Also, they're much slower if you're looking forward to making a major profit.
On top of that, the broker I found allows for selling the trade before its finished (although with a margin) which isn't much different from a stop loss, except for the fact that it needs to be triggered manually.Please let me know your thoughts.
Under my skin I feel like there's something fishy going on, because it almost seems too easy, but I can't argue with the results.
The biggest thing IMO is that a website may manipulate actual prices by a pip or two so your call or put will be loss.

Over a large sample size, with real money, you will see that it is a glorified coin flip with no discernible advantage for you to exploit.
They seem to follow the same price sources as TrandingView, so I'd say they're trustworthy in that matter.4362914I'm planning on getting to 1000% before I start trading with real money.
I'm cautious enough, thank you for your concern.
If the difficulty proves to suddenly turn against me at some point I'll definitely write about it here.
