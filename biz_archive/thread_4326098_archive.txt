LITERALLY EVERYTHING BUT DASH CRASHEDWHY??
And Monero.
And CloakCoin.
You're in privacy coin town now, boy.
dash is like bitcoin but structured like a pyramid scheme and has a cabal of insiders propping up the price in an even more cohesive way than the ones that do it for bitcoin so it's a bit more sturdy price wise, believe it not
ssshhhhh...................., pleb.
because Dash always does the opposite of what BTC does.
explain through history anon.
Dash is neutral.
BTC and BCH are trying to kill each other.
You can try to pick a winner or you can stay out of the fight.
It's a choice of risk losing money vs. keep stable money
