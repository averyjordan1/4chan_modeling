When will you fags listen?
I told you at 12 cents, nobody cared and at 20 cents, I was accused of beeing a bagholder.
Now it's at 25 and it's reaching 1$ soon.
It's just beeing discored, trading volume is low but its getting more fast.
Now is still a good time to buy.31 Million total supply, 5 million marketcap, Partnership(copied from their blog):Grupo PRISA—world’s leading Spanish and Portuguese-language media group.OmiseGO—fully public and decentralized payment and exchange platform.TCL/Alcatel/Hawk—top-10 global mobile phone manufacturer selling products in over 160 countries.I don't think what more you could ask for, undervalued as fuck.
1$ per HBT is(31 million marketcap) is very easy to reach and could happen very fast as soon as it reaches a big exchange.
Only on ED right now, accumulate faggots while you can.
Fuck.
I wish I had more time to accumulate.
Knew it would blow up sometime around now though.
Petting my cheap 36k Hubiits.As the first mover with immense partnerships in the decentralized media access sale market, as well as decentralized crowd funding, media investment and more, it will be immense.It also does not require such a high transaction throughput that it will be bottlenecked by ethereum so long as ethereum goes proof of stake first.It launches very soon too.
I would be surprised if this isn't at least 1bn marketcap by end of year.
Did I mention it will be immense?Done accumulating I guess so might as well shill.
Already hit 2x of my initial buy price.It's going to be immense.Also has Telenor behind it and Hubii's non-blockchain business into which the blockchain tech will be inserted already has more than 50 million customers.Immense.
agree.
I knew about this since ICO.
Only got 1k worth of Hubi.
But only paid like 400$ for it so I am happy.
Trying to buy some more tho
*end of year 2018 that isDefinitely going to be a good chunk of money if it takes off.
May we both make it.
i really believe so
