>net worth 4 million>cant afford a La Ferrari 1.2 millionim confused?
why cant he afford the car
>he thinks net worth is entirely liquid assets>he thinks that someone should spend a quarter of their net worth on a caryou'l never make it
Not everyone with 1.2 million can buy the LaFerrari are you stupid
maybe because you don't buy a car worth 1/4 of your net worth
>He thinks all that networth is liquid>He thinks its worth losing a quarter of your networth for a fucking car
