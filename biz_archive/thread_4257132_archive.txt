This kid has made $300k off a pyramid scheme and bought 5000LTC whilst I'm sitting on barely 10LTC.
Fuck I'm so jealous
Is this a black guy?
No he's the 16 year old white kids that shills bitconnect.
Everyone on /biz/ is mad that he got rich because it's "immoral" and he's "scamming his poor innocent subscribers".
I'm just extremely envious.
To sit atop a large pyramid scheme, making thousands for doing nothing, I wish that was me.
