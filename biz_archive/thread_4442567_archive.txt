Omg are releasing a wallet in q1 2018, req are releasing a full product that can be used by the masses.This really isnt a tough choice.Fake stickers on skateboards or a team that knuckles down with progress reports every fortnight and a fully working product with 3 months?

Omg time on the market, 4 monthsREQ time on the market, 4 weeks, during one of the worst time for alts, or did you not notice omg is down from half its all time high.But dont let facts get in the way of your argument.
