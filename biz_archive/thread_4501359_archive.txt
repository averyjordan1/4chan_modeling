Silicon valley type libtard it people work actively against little stuff that really doesn't change all that much like motorsports in the name of environmentalism, but they have absolutely nothing against mining when it can easily be replaced and no one would care except for a couple monopolies.This isn't natural is it?
Or is it only because they are idiots?
