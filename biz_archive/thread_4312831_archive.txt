 It's too risky dude.
You're just gambling at this point.
The bch shills on the biz are retarded and just hate on bitcoin cuz it raped their alts.
>Bitcoin moonsNEW PARADIGM.
1 MILLION PER COIN>Bitcoin dipsSELL SELL.
IT'S GOING TO DIE.
MUH FLIPPENINGlike clockwork
Big if true.
Go all in XMR or ETH and laugh at the bickering faggots.
This.
I sometimes ponder whether the people here are all ironic or just retarded.
look at bch github, they have maybe 2 developers and they dont do shit besides copy and paste a bugfix from bitcoin every couple weeks.
very few exchanges besides chinese list bch and everything is still in bitcoin prices.
kek.
there are multiple wallet implementations of bitcoin cash.
and fucking boss devs are coming back out in support of bch like gavinbch is no longer tied down to the blockstream politics, we can now iterate and improve bitcoin before its too late
with blockstream gone there is nothing left to hold back bitcoin now.
HAHA HE HASN'T STARTED TO TRYING TO DUMP HIS BTC YET
BCH isn't going to go to 7k it will scare normies away from crypto altogether for a few more years eth will be king, they will implement the segewit2x after this shitfest
GO ALL IN BCH, WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE YOU WAITING FOR.
DO IT, HOLY SHIT, these last 24 hours have been incredible.
See you on the moon, bches
