>Buy ARK at 81k because everyone says it's the floor>Buy more ARK at 68k because everyone says it's the floor>Buy even more at 55k because everyone said it was the floor>Buy again at 40k because I thought it'd recover at least a little bit after BTC drops back down>BTC hitting new ATH every day and alts are still bleeding>ARK bouncing between 36-37k FUCK BITCOIN JUST FUCKING CRASH ALREADY YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT
>Implying alts won't crash if bitcoin crashesyou're donzo
Atleast if you look at dollar value its been insanely stable the whole time so fiat wise I doubt you lost much money.I know that's not exactly what you want to hear because we're all here to make more bitcoin.. but its a good sign that it'll pump soon when money finally comes back to alts
he fell for the ark meme
i feel for you fellow arkie
Literally every other time this has happened in the past year the gains from BTC always flooded back into alts Why the fuck isn't it happening this time?
Because BTC keeps hitting new ATH?
>OP keeps cost averaging down>misses the chance to buy at 25k or anything under 30kAlso you want bitcoin to stabilize, not crash.
So what I should just keep buying when I can?I'm deluded and really think it will go back up to ATH again
Basically, it isn't steady like before.
Alts do best with a stable BTC.
I think it will go back up to ATH>Should I keep buying?Why even ask that question?
OP is butthurt cuz his shitcoin is a shitcoin.Hey OP!
But the BTC dip.
Be a winner
