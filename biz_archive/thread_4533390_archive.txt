Freaking the fuck out about this dragonslayer shit, I've got 30 BTC and am willing to change for BCH if it's true.BIZ what the fuck do I do?
I have the BTC on my ledger so i'm guessing by the time I get it to the exchanges I would have missed out if there is a pump?
50-50
what the fuck is this dragonslayer shit
Regardless of if it takes over, the ration of bcc to btc is going to improve.
If you have 30 BTC I'd suggest buying 30 BCH, also buy 30 BTGthere will be many forks in the future
dogecoin has more transactions then bch.
so yes, you should buy bch.
Some chinks trying to fuck over every single BTC holder because they insist that their alt coin is the real Bitcoin.
FUCK China!
when / why did this become dragonslayer

does he end up losing his shit with this fucking guy?
go all in BCH
Yes, he does the sensitive body gestures and gets a little irritated and awkward at one point.
He also says miners will do what's profitable, it's a business.
He also throws in a weird conspiracy that THE MAN HIMSELF is behind BCH, not some random Asian company.
