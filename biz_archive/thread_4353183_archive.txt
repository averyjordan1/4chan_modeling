Game is on, now the competition of hashrate matters almost fully on price.
If bch dips profitability on btc rises &hashrate moves to btc.
If btc gains same happens.
And reverse.
I wonder wich one is more keen for a dip lol.
Soon btc will have 99% hashrate and due to this new difficulty adjustment update on bch cant leech it anymore.
>variable hash rate101 on how to:-destroy the value of your currency -eventually get removed from exchanges that cant get their shit together with the difficulty
Bch was more profitable to mine only for few blocks lol.
Miners will lose interest to swap between networks, that could cause them miss a block on btc network.
What I find interesting is that the prices, when added, have been around 7300 all day.BCH is becoming an inverse BTC.
BTC bear.
That could be a really good thing, fuck a “flippening”,
