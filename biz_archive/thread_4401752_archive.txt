good job, op
That's how I felt when I bought some 'at the top' at 4400 and it immediately dropped.
Man, getting suckered in at the ATH sure was stupid of me!

Reposition yourself on an alt you think will go up that s your only chance to getting some money back now
let me know when you sell it OP

We just fell to 5200 wtf were you doing last weekend?

You'll probably look back next year and think you got it cheap
You could contact your bank and ask them to refund the charge.
But if your a true hodler, you should hold until you dick falls off
