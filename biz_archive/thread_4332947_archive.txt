>OP market buys instead of letting the game come to him
Let's run an experiment.
OP, tell me, where would you buy on this chart?
And be honest!
at consolidation phase
So you buy every coin and wait for the eventual pump?Are you a cryptomillionaire?
Knowing the outcome don't expect real answers
use daily candles and zoom out
fomo in about hereit's the biz way
No just find something that has some hype behind it, news events coming up, and watch for whale activity in the book, check bitcoins movement, then put some cost averaged buy orders on a support level or halfway down to the next on.
Letting the GAY cum to himidiot.I always market buy when it get low enough then market sell when it pumps
