Who else holding SIA bags here?>bought at 600 sats thinking it was a dip (ath was 850 sats)>it's 60 sats now>I'm currently sitting at $1.6k of the roughly $16k I put in back in JuneI literally wake up at night sweating, and started going to the psychiatrist
500 sats here, this is a permanent baga trophy, of sorts
