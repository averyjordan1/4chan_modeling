What happens to the price once that sell pressure is relieved?Once new money learns this and buys while the price is consolidating i.e.
on a level ground, the sell pressure will be relieved right?
Then not only does ETH price go up buy OMG and others too?Once GDAX list tokens I think ETH sell pressure will get decimated by new money and whales creating FOMO.
