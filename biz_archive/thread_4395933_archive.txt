why did you buy BCH?
BUY HIGH SELL LOW.
/biz/ told me to, brought at 2300 just sold at 1200.
Hell i had my sell orders placed at $2900 but instead it crashed.
I bet you are less than 18We don't care about your life faggot.
Nobody is going it fix it for you.
Never buy anything unless you do some research.Also 99% of the posts here are just posted in self-interest.I hope you learned your lesson.For example, do some research on NLC2 and tell me if it's a coin worth investing into or not
I'm fairly new to this and I've lost some money on some stupid impulse trade choices but the thing I've learned that's kept me from getting JUSTed is to simply avoid buying coins on fresh highs.
If the % change in price is green, that means it is NOT time to buy.
Especially if it just jumped 10% or more - it's too late.
Red numbers mean OPPORTUNITY to buy.
Could still tank more, could be a shitcoin.
But buying off of fresh highs is a one way ticket to JUST city.
I almost put 100 bucks on NEOG the other night when it was at 200%, but I talked myself out of it and the next morning it was down 30%.
Bullet dodged.
My life savings turned from $6000 to $3000Must suck being that poor.
Then stop chasing pumps if you keep getting dumped on.
Buy cheap, long term holds and focus on your schooling.
I'd recommend ARK and XLM, but do your own research and figure it out for yourself.
You should never chase pump and dumps with money you needKeep most of your crypto in the big names (BTC, ETH, LTC, etc) and use those profits to chase the others
/biz/ told me to
Sucks to be you.
>Get laid, get a hooker.>Trade: btc / eth ...wouldnt bother with anything else (fyi bch is recovering but eth is going to moon)
/biz/ told me toHahaha fucking idiot.
If you can't be fucked to do your own research then you deserved to lose all of it.
Fucking retard trying to get rich quick but can't even put in the bare minimum effort.AND you sold low, before the next BTC difficulty adjustment?You have a double digit IQ and literally zero clue what you're doing.
Open a Vanguard account and invest in the S&P 500 and come to terms with the fact that you are a brainlet.
This is for your own good.
...why buy NEOG in the first place?
Death sounds like it'd be a sweet relief for you

NLC2Good whitepaper, good idea, good endorsement.
I would say yes, but this coin is already up 200x and 40M marketcap is pretty high already for this kind of sports business.
The news has been sold already.
Probably the price will slowly go downhill for the next half year.
Way to go, you followed the /biz/ technique perfectly.
