Do you use any indicators when you trade crypto?
I've found most use of the Relative Strength Index and sometimes I use the Bollinger bands.
Usually I also throw a volume oscillator on for good measure.I'm not convinced these are anything other than confidence boosters though.
i usually just smash my keyboard til somethin happens
I buy everthing /biz/ shills me.
I'm homeless since 2 days and suck off old guys for money.thanks biz..
What chart do you use RSI on?
(The hourly chart, 15 minutes chart, 5 minutes chart, ...)
