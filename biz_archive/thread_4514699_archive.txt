>IOTA will be on bittrex in the next day or two>it's been over a weekthese devs are fucking SCAMMERS

Why are the devs scammers?When / where did they say they would be listed in Bittrex?

Did you ever see a link or proof?
Or are you just hating the hedge investment to blockchain?

I hope someone else saved it.
Something like that should be easy to find given the amount of FUD around IOTA.
Surely David's comment saying that they would be listed in Bittrex.com would have made rounds here on 4chan and reddit......
I will wait for you to find it....

yeah no, you learnt something today didn't you op?
shills will go to great lengths, eg, faking screens so you buy their bags.
I already sold all my IOTA months ago after they pulled the "lol lets roll our own insecure trinary crypto for no justifiable reason whatsoever" thing.
Yeah, that doesn't look real Anon.
Do you have any other "proof"?
I-I want to b-believe you.... I-Iota sucks.... y-yeah - right g-guys?
