Am I the only one who got burned investing in DNT, thinking it was the pbc pick?

You bought the pump like the little, stupid, broke autist that you are.
Your thought process shouldn't even be considered "thinking".

Yeah I fell for it too man.
Take heart, eventually you will get your money back if your patient.

It has a tiny market cap anyways anything can happen
I guess the team is made up of guys from coinbase, so it canâ€™t be a total shitcoin

I put in 4 ether and cashed out nearly 9. so yeah you are!
DNT was one of my biggest gains
Am I the only one who got burned investing in DNT, thinking it was the pbc pick?Friendly advice for a fellow anon - all the PBC pick stuff is fake.
People are just trying to get you to buy their pumps.
Gullible people who fall for this stuff are the reason this board is filled with shills.
Some get lucky and make a profit, most end up bag-holding.
Try not to fall for it next time, and think more before investing on the advice of an anon.DNT is a great project but a terrible investment.
Dump it and move it, or hold for a few months until it is arbitrarily pumped one day.
DNT has ethlance.com and namebazaar.io, two real projects, unlike other coins that just have vaporware.They are probably going to create the '1Hive Funding Platform', since it's getting the most votes for them to create after meme factory.
It's an alternative to kickstarter, and has a lot of potential.https://github.com/district0x/district-proposals/issues/3I wouldn't dump this coin now.
It has a lot of upside room to grow.
