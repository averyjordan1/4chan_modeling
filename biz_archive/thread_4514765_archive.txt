Fuck CoinbaseI bought back in may.
Bank account is all verified and whatnotNOW I just tried buying bitcoin again and NOW you have to upload a photo id of your greasy face just to deposit fiat.
then after weeks you can buy bitcoin.
what the fuck nigger, did they make new regulations?
fuck coinbaseYeah I agree, I bought 0.07 BTC and 3 ETH on 11/18/17 and it wonâ€™t be delivered until 11/28/17.
I missed out on all the fat POWR gains.
yesover the summer they had some dealings with the IRS
yeah but now there an additonal requirement to fund fiat first so you have to wait an additional week
uhh whats the problem?
Mad you can't avoid taxes?
My coinbase account got emptied out in 2014 I think, I only had like $10 left on it.
But someone from an Android device got past my 2fa somehow.
There were a lot of posts online at the time of it happening to other people.Ever since then though, Ive been banned from buying at all.
Theyll respond to my tickets saying theyll look into it but never follow up with why they wont give me access again.I sent in another ticket asking about it and they wanted my social security number and selfie.
This was an account made since their launch so I never went through any verification.
They got my info then closed the ticket and have never responded since.Coinbase sucks.
im a neet.
the government owes me money
What fiat-to-crypto service other than coinbase does /biz/ recommend?
Kraken is good for worldwide but thats about it, and I remeber it took 2 months to verify... may to julyalso its terrible in every other aspect
