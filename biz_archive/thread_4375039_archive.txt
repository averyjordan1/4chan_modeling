Valuations are high.
I am going to buy a place next year, but I question the logic of taking out a mortgage when I have pretty much what I need to buy the property, already invested in index funds & stocks.What would you do?
My ultimate aim is early retirement.1) Pull money out of the stock market to buy a property outright, start investing again from scratch.2) Pay off the mortgage quickly, don't buy any more stocks, just leave them to compound or go sideways.3) Continue to invest as much as I can into the stock market.
Have a small mortgage payment (10 yr mortgage).
property markets are at a ath because of chinese people trying to get out of china, were at or near 2008 levels I think
property markets are at a ath because of chinese people trying to get out of china, were at or near 2008 levels I thinkThe apartment will cost me approx $125k US in my country.I see more downside to equities than property... in the USA house prices dropped 18% whereas stocks fell more than twice that, 45% or something.
Also, property rebounded quicker.Emotionally/intuitively I prefer stocks to property, because they're liquid and don't require 'maintenance'.I guess I could hedge my bets and go 50-50 stocks/mortgage, get the place paid off in 7 years.
