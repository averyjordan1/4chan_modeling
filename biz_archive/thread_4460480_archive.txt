Bought $15k worth of confido earlier at 15 cents.Thanks for the incredibly cheap bags, faggots.
Easiest 4-6x I've ever made in my lifelmao.
should I still buy now?
you're brave as shit
It will easily recover to 50-60 cents and perhaps go higher, it's actually a very good coin.
What happened really wasn't that bad, but the way JOOST handled it was laughably terrible which caused the 90% price drop.
They had terrible PR advice, but the coin is good.
It's rebounding like crazy right now.
confidolol kill yourself faggot
>Tfw bought at a little over .00023 Got weak hands and sold at around .00037 though and it's like twice that now.
Faith in this scam is much stronger than I figured, oh well
