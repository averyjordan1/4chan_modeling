The asians are about to wake up, realize BTC is down/stale and buy their favorite coin.
This will double in the next 24 hours.
You can stay in your current alt coin and make 15% or buy monacoin and 2x.
Up to you.

The asians aren't stupid and know that BTC didn't dip below $7k and will start crushing alts again in less than 24 hours
