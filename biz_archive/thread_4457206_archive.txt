The right delegate is biz_classic right?Also can I store my ark offline and keep the vote/keep receiving the payout or does it have to be held in ark client wallet?
Will the mobile wallet work?Which hardware wallet would you recommend if it's possible to store there and still receive delegate payout?
Thank youAlso should I change payout settings?
Right now not getting much maybe like .8 of an ark per week.
Will it save me money to just do it monthly or is the regular setup okay?
find an established ARK thread and ask, chances are Chang will come and answer your questions
I'm a biz_classic voter and I have a ledger nano s. I've had no issues.
I'd go with monthly payments in your position.
Biz_classic is very stable, you'll get your payouts.
