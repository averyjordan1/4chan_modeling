Whatâ€™s this things problem?
When moon?
this.
now
Less money invested vs a similar solution like OMG, so people look to the established names>Developers specifically told those shilling to fuck off, so there's less hype outside of /biz/Honestly, I expect a 3-5x return after the first iteration of their product launches this year.
After the next release, it'll go up even more.I'm only hodling 26k and I'd like to bump that up to 50k.
I can see it hitting OMGs market cap around Q3.
this is the weird thing about this marketif this was at a 100m cap you could justify it (team,vision,product) and it would have holders at that level but since it hasnt been shilled by the big boys its still under icolong story short... req wont moon without bittrex
That's the biggest appeal of this coin.
It's not over exposed like the top 20 altcoins with huge, bloated capitalizations and nothing to show for it (OMG).If this product works and is likely to be delivered sooner than OMG, it goes parabolic.
