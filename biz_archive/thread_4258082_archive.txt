thoughts on viral advertising?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiuucxNmY-w
worked in advertising on the web team.
This isn't the most effective strategy, getting a video on a popular sellout channel, most people tune in to see the fight not the product.this is exaggerated by having the advert look very adultish, there is no kids they spend most of their time indoors etc.The most effective viral advertising is interactive advertising, Twitter is a good example of an ideal advertising platform
forgot pic, love ads within ads.
