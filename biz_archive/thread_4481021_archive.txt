They already bought LTC but are worried because they bought it right before China FUD.
How do I tell them I don't care about anything other than crypto?Should I leave those friends behind once on the moon?
You sound autistic as fuck, you aren’t the Joker, you’re just a school shooter in the making.
Enjoy your bags cuck.

Just do your own thing, live your own life.
