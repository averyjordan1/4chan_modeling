GLT, EGOLD & Monaco
Coss, odn, dbix

KIN, ZAP, PIGGY
ETPBCC
IOOOOOTTTAAAAAAA
Mmmm not bad.
I just dont like GLT because the volume is too small but Egold and Monaco are good
heard this, but do you think it can moon within the next month or so, or more long term?
Fuck all these coins, go all in on CFD now
...ZOIN
this and beyond will be big for IOTA.
get in now while it's cheap.
it's next gen tech
not a shitcoin at all but CFD
Why?
What makes it worth it?
DOVU
LINK
Interesting...
IOTA is good tech but an awful toxic foundation
DOVU probably has the highest potential right now...partnership with Jaguar / Land Rover and solid team behind it.
ZcashGold, 60% supply burn soon and CEX listing soon.

Announced yesterday.Already one person tried to invest $1m
REQ
EDO, also keeping a close eye on ODN
It has no tangible application until 2018 why the fuck would it hit 10k SATs before then?
I think it only works in situations where multiple properties share the same meter, specifically townhouses under "strata title".
The system would also work for apartment buildings except they don't tend to have individual solar panels.
Can't believe there is only shit shilled here.
Here are two solid ones:>AST (beta release in Q4, full version in Q1) >BAY (just look at the roadmap)
NULS and BCH
Not even good tech
