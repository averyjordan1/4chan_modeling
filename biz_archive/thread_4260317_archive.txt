if you were to all in on one solid alt right now which would it be?OMG, NEO, WTC, QTUM, or what?
confido or link you dumb fuck
NEO
xmr
CFD
LINK and wait for Q1 2018 until I dump everything
all in?ETH if it's considered an altif not, then OMG or BLOCKinb4 toilet marines
XMR THE KING
NEO - ANY bad or good crypto announcement from china will be moon news
Ark
NEOOMG good project but big dreams will take years to realise by that time neo is 1000$+
Probably nuls this is testing tension so hard.It's about to nut everywhere
ALL in ?Hmm Eth but after this Parity thing TWICE now..Waves and or Ark

hangman on nuls faggot get a rope
Yeah probably NEO.
ETP for similar reasons but NEO feels safer.
how is nuls the most solid alt right now?shitty website and no whitepaper
Stellar Lumens
omg or xmr
NEO.
you can generate passive GAS while the market consolidates.
LINKIES!
OMG.It's mooning solidly right now.
I all in everytime.But my most recent all in was vert coin at 50k and it's doing OK.
NULS bruh
Right now REQ, it's the only solid project that still has to moon.
Req
OMG > NEO the rest are garbage
SIC
Sys
ADA desu
This.
Cannot stress enough NULS is gonna be China's bitcoin.
SpankChain
Ark, no question NEO looks good too
poo coin
REQ not even going to explain why it's going to moon
WTC will have news first that will send it much higher, NEO is a safer hold but still seems likely to break out in the near future.
OMG for the long haul, potentially after gains in WTC and OMG first.
NULS 100%
Salt or Lumens.I think REQ is going to be huge too but not feeling as 100% about it as with Salt and Lumens.
KMD get it cheap now wait till 10 November
Ecc, distributed network services are being tested now.
