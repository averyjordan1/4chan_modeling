With bitcoin going crazy, this won't end good for alts.
When btc crashes (and it will) of course alts get drug down even further.
Will they ever come back?

Newfag detected.Bitcoin is stagnant as fuck ATM so speculators are jumping on alts to make gains.
As long as BTC does not breach the 8K mark alts will continue to go up.Tips:- BTC UP, ALTS DOWN- BTC DOWN, ALTS DOWN- BTC STAGNANT, ALTS STAGNANTwhy?
Because people want more bitcoin, so they sell to tether when it drops (to buy in later for more BTC) They sell their alts when BTC rallies (so they do not loose BTC value) and they trade when BTC is doing nothing to attempt to get more Bitcoin.
Worthless.
