powr pump tonight confirmed by hong kong group (they do this weekly).
i got out at 5k and now im thinking of coming back in just for tonight.
looks like they plan on dumping at 10k sats.
The upward trends look promising, possibly even leaning towards another pump.
After the large dump that finished about 2 hours ago, it's up 20% already.
False-- That's a BTC price projection.
Don't fall for this dumb attempt at a POWR pump.
