Brainlet here.How far in advance are key updates on a project's roadmap priced in before the said updates are released?I like the look of a few projects Q1 2018 updates but unsure if the updates are priced in in the token price right now.
Should I be thinking 3-6 months out, or more shorter term (few weeks to a few months)
Never seen this rare pepe
