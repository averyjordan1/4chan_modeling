Did I miss the BCH train?
Am I about to get JUST'D?
Started at 5k today.
yes
You didn't miss it.
Psychological resistance at $1000 but it will blast through it soon.
I'd go all in, BTC is going nowhere.
yup it's over, don't be a retard and fomo, you'll just be buying bags
why didnt you sell your BTC you fucking retard
DONT LISTEN TO THE FUD, ANON PLEASE PLEASE TRUST THE PROCESS....I AM FUCKING TIRED OF EVERYONE SELLING WHEN THIS SHIT HASNT EVEN STARTED
I didn't fomo, I had to transfer which took a while and also sleep on it.
I sold half my btc.
Prepare to learn a lot of lessons OP.
Only fuck around with a few 100$ until you know what you're at.
told my dad btc was a good investment >btc crashes>have to make sure it's ok to get BCH >buy BCH at ATH>JUST
Just stop FOMO buying.
BTC is always going to end up going up.
Also stop reading /biz/ so much.
It's full of shills begging you to buy their bags.
It'll lead you to making bad decisions.
I didn't think of it as FOMO.
obviously wanted to buy at 700 but had to wait.
As BTC Was crashing I thought of it as leveraging/hedging
I need a fucking drink anons
Invest in an alt, they're bound to rise soon and its possible you'll make gains back.
