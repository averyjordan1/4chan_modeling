Have a good time guys.
Same Chinese friend telling everyone about Nuls summary and news.
This is my last post on Nuls.http://m.jinse.com/news/blockchain/90416.htmlAs a Chinese person this is all the info I need.
Neo will be surpassed.
I knew Binance wouldn't list a scam coin.
They know something.
Sure buddy.
There is no link between Elephant Alliance and this shitcoin Nuls.
Dumb shit it says inchain which is fucking nuls.
Whats the circulating supply?
inchain the failed crypto insurance ICO.
Its a fucking scam team.
Anyone buying now is going to get scalded.
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nuls/Says "?"
for circulating, but total supply is listed as 40,000,000 NULS.That can't be right.
It will increase to 100,000,000 in the following year.
Being held ready to be dumped.
Don't confuse this with something solid like NEO.
There is zero information on this coin around and the whitepaper is utter shit.
If you are going to drop money on this do yourself a favour and at the very least read through the paper and ask yourself if this is worthy of your money.
https://nuls.io/pdf/Nuls_whitepaper_en_V1.0.pdfThe amount of threads here is alarming and you should have all learnt from Link that people are ready to shit all over you.
Wasn't this a dollar last night
Wrong numbers 100mm for total supply and 40mm circulating.
Confirmed by Nuls team.
It was now it's just bag holders shilling trying to dump their bags.
It's funny really.
WTC all over again - same FUD, same price movements
You're a moron!
