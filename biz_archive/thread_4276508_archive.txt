>he doesn't realize that when all alts are doing well, a BTC moon is imminentA good majority of "earnings" from altcoins are pooled back into BTC.
The big green %s for the altcoins draws in the bugs into the spider's trap as they literally buy high like the brainlets they are, then the creator of the coin will suddenly drop the price of the coin harshly, and the money gained will funnel into BTC.
You really think the market controls your alt coins?
The creator of the coin decides how much it sells for.

He can take all the money from the coin whenever he wants.
Now is the time to buy the BTC dip while the altcoin insects are preparing a feast for us.
It will go up to $8K and beyond with this feast.
