Get ready for another BTC ath in the coming weeks...

wishful thinking/delusion
BTC will never go over 1k, its wishful thinking and delusion...>BTC will never go over 2k, its wishful thinking and delusion...>Repeat at 3kkkkk....

I also expect a new ATH in the coming weeks but I can't see the future by drawing random lines into a graph..
but muh bcc and the flippeining HHHAHAHHAHAAH
9k by end of year
Because this is what 70% of TA people predicted.
Everything is happening exactly according to this prediction.
It seems that despite all the shit that's going on, BTC doesn't give a fuck about the fork, people don't give a fuck about the fork, market does its own magical thing any way.
