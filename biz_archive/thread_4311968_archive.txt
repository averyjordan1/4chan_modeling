literally don't know what to do.
All in alts.
Portfolio is dropping fast.
Do I sell all to buy BTC or BCH?
Cash out entirely?
WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT
Same, anon.
My anus is bleeding.. please help
im honestly considering cashing out entirely and waiting for all this nonsense to sort itself out.
was up 100% initial investment months ago, legit today because of this im like 200$ from what i put in.
utterly fucking nuts.
i dont even know what to throw money that is atleast stable everything is fucked.
4312008ETHmake a decision lateror hodl, the alts are down cuz the giants are sparring.
Once it's over (if it ever ends....) the alts will recover.
ETH has been stable for a while, I suspect a lot of the profits from from this BCH fiasco will end up in ETH wallets
BTC, BCH, BTX, BTG, ETH, USDT These are your only options
I bought Tethers.
Come at me bros.
This.
ETH is the safe bet right now.
BCC, RIDE IT TO 3K, THE FLIPPENING IS HEREEEEEEE
Just go into eth, the flippening has failed
BCC, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR???!?!?!?!
