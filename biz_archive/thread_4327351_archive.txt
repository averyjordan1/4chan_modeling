Cashed out of a sportsbook and used btc yesterday.
They said they sent it around 1pm so over 26 hours agoHow much longer do I have to wait?
I want to sell it for more altsI know there's a huge backlog but wtf it's over a day now

It will probably be 48 hours before the mempool gets cleared.... Maybe longer if txes keep happening at a high rate.
I'm sorry anon, you're going to see some more losses while you're stuck in limbo.
Actually ... thinking about it some more, I just realized that txes are going to stay high, and miners are going to move back over to BCH on the next difficulty update.I don't think the mempool will be cleared until 3 weeks from now, when the BTC difficulty update happens.
By that time, BTC could be completely worthless.
Yeah luckily it's only a few hundred bucks.
Sucks though
