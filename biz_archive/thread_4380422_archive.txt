So A friend of mine who owns an insurance group has asked me to start his online (facebook, google pay per click) marketing.
Now I'm pretty much a noob to online marketing, but I figure hey, I'm computer savvy and smart enough to take this on.
My question is, what is the usual rate for someone to run an online marketing campaign for a business?
Is it paid by the hour, a flat rate...?
I just don't even know how to start negotiating the price before I actually put my real effort into it.
Also, any tips are appreciated
