ITT: we laugh at BCH bag holdersBuy my BuCHhi bags /biz/
Canâ€™t believe people fell for this shit
bitcoin3x.orgStay poor.
Kick me, I deserve this.Also, at the moment I'm losing even more due to Bitcoin being unable to stop the bleeding after the failed assassination attempt.
I think I'll pull out to fiat, count my losses, and take a good walk.
If you are in BTC, stay in BTC for the next 2 days.We're about to hit the "return to normal" and might reach 7k+ again before crashing faster and harder.Cash out early, dont get greedy.
Thank me later.Post this spiderweb image when you thank me, so I know you made your money back.
bch just bottomed out, hash power returning, can we just start calling bch bitcoin and bitcoin bitcoin legacy already
bch just bottomed out,It's going back down man
Get your self checked by a mental health professional mateBCH is done.
Hashpower dont matter if no one wants to buy your bags.
Miners will return to BTC, its only a matter of time.
No thanks I will buy the dip at $800 and ride the next wave in a few weeks, it's that simple.
It was so fucking obvious it was a pump n dump.
Yet whenever you tried to talk sense into them they got furious lol.
The retards deserves this
