It's over!

Abandon ship!
lol, sub part of Inchain aka huge china company.far from over.idc i bought at .0009 but i dont want other people feeling like its going to tank and getting fucked.
Really?

Should I sell now or will I regret that?
>Sell Nuls while it's still high>Buy POWR in case any news comes out in the next day or two>Sell POWR after it moons to buy back into Nuls before it gets to $1.50The master plan
When you wake up tomorrow morning this thing will be at fifty cents.
If you bought at the high, dump it.
It's so far from over.
THE PROPHECYYou will regret this.
Congrats on your profit.
Try not to buy again at three dollars.
We don't need you on the moon.
OP sold the dip like dumbass
When I started this thread five minutes ago it was 95 cents.
Now it's 87.
How long before it's 80?
Or 70?
What did you pay for your bags?
.11 bnbBought more at .23 bnb
 cents now.
More like 90 cents dumbass.
We're not done yet buddy.
Fuck will this crash overnight?
This thing has been stable 330-360 for a long time now, chart shows ANOTHER moonshot coming.
75 cents in the next 30 minutes.
I'm calling it.
Do you know this shit is already 30x ICO price?
ICO was for Inchain back then, and tokens were swapped / airdropped 1:1 to NULS.
Dump this shit and go to ADA or some legit shit.
