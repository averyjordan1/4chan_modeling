REQ is going to moon to $1 r-right?
maybe once it breaks the ico walls.
Nah, I'm sure the market cap won't go that low.
$NULS is going to outperform everything within the next 72hours
what's your expectation for Q1 2019, anon?
Q1 2019?
How the fuck would you predict something 1,5 year in the future especially in crypto.
Even Q1 2018 is full of ????????
haha, wait for the fork.
will moon for sure.
then second mooning Q1 2018.
$1 by end of year$5 by mid 2018$10 by end of 2018$25 by mid 2019
don't ever believe someone who gives you values especially in USD.
you can expect gains of about 2x to 3x after fork.
If you hold into Q1 2018 probably 5x to 10x.
Go check the roadmap... and they are ahead of schedule.
With the staking and burning we'll see 100x within a year guaranteed
Dude, I own a lot of REQ because I see the potential.
But saying things like that is not good for the coin.
I always prefer to understate the growth.
worst case scenario with this coin is you double your money.
Best case is probably somewhere around 100x but stay grounded.
