mashallah brotherrefugee cities soon
it's just a long pnd.

the project goals are impossible and the devs are promising things they don't know how to achieve.
get out before it crashes.
remember that this could happen while you're asleep or just not actively watching.
take your gains and put them in something whose future isn't walking off a suddenly appearing cliff.
bought at 30 cents you faggots
goals are impossible, yeah sure *laughing in lambo soon*
Bought at .20 in August.
Have held ever since.The FUD is purely from people scared of this making blockchain obsolete.
The only coin that is unthreatened is BTC because that will always be used as a store of value.Get in now.
Cryptocurrency 3.0 is here.
$20 this time next year.For more information Google "the Tangle"
