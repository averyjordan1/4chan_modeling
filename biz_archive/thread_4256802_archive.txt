"Unfortunately, it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean block size upgrade at this time.
Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoinâ€™s growth.
This was never the goal of Segwit2x.
""Until then, we are suspending our plans for the upcoming 2MB upgrade," he added.> Until then> thenUntil they have accumulated enough coins to become billionaires
You fags are becoming deluded.
So what you're saying is that you want another fork to pump the price right?
I thought you fags loved Bitcoin?
Why do you want Segwit2x to happen?
it really is fucking suspicious.. but how do i know you're not the faggot bag hodling 90 b2x
It was never going to happen, it was market manipulation to create instability so people would sell off, then BTC's (((overseers))) bought the dip.
Great now they'll come back in a couple of months and fuck the alts in the ass all over again.
You dumb goys don't even realise these kikes were busy buying up BCH while FUDDING this segwit2x shit.
BCH literally doubled in anticipation of this announcement, meaning it was insider trading.Segwit2x will never happen, you've been conned.
Buy bitcoin cash.
They deluded themselves into thinking they had the power to meme their forked altcoin into replacing bitcoin, then they realized they didn't have that kind of sway over what is considered bitcoin and so they stopped themselves before losing millions a day by mining B2X over BTC.
They can try again but it again won't work.
B2X is fucking dead.
this is actually correct.
lol
I wouldn't touch anything with the word (((bitcoin))) in its name with a 39.5 foot pole.
I wouldn't be surprised if they do the same scam a few more times though.
They found the perfect way to manipulate the whole market.
