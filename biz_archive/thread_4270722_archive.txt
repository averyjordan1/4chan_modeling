Hi guys,I developed a little tool to track my altcoins and those of my friends and family.
You just have to download the right version for you and put your coins into the csv file and you are good to go.
I hope you can enjoy this little piece of software and if you have improvement suggestions, hints, questions or something else, do not hesitate to write leave me a comment below.
Happy trading, my friends.https://life-sucks.info/818/coinviewer-v2-usdeurbtc-versions/
