So is anyone here into bitconnect?
What do you guys think?
Am I going to get arse fucked in the end if I lend to them?
I invested ~300 a week and a half ago just to see where it takes me.
I'd say throw some money you don't mind losing at it./biz/ spergs out super fucking hard at bitconnect, won't find a single post praising it here.
Pretty typical though, most people here are fomo retard normie tier so they get mad when they think they missed something, see LINK for example.
Throw a few hundred dollars at it and see what happens.
No more, no less.Utter those words I just did though unsolicited, and watch the /biz/ fucking sperg out and get more angry than they should.You can laugh at them next year.
OP here,I put in 1k just for the fuck of it.
I am curious where it will take me, if I get scammed then they are very good at it.I hope to laugh at them next year.
Win big or lose it all senpai.
That's what I concluded with my paltry $300.
I've lost way more on shitcoins, why not bet it on something like bitconnect which could see another year or two of life?Play it smart and you'll be ok.
If bitconnect is around in a year I'll probably cash out half a day.
you can't win with bitconnect.the amount u make in a year is less than if you had just held bitcoin.this is because they price everything in USD.
