Alright fuckers, I plan on claiming the American Opportunity Tax Credit for 2016 and 2017 (2016 via an amended return).Trouble is, all I have to back up the expense claims are bank account transaction history screenshots, my schools account transaction page which says how much I paid out of pocket, and my amazon order history.Should I just say fuck it and claim it or should I only claim things I have receipts for?
