Wtf is happening?
I go on vacation for a week and now my eth is mooning
can you go on vacation forever pls?
this, please!
My theory is that some people are trying toput their holdings in ETH this weekend because of Operation Dragon Slayer, ensuring that they buy the dip of whatever coin wins, at a profit.It is the safest way, and also guarantees some gains.Goddamn, I'm happy I did that.
you dragonfudders are adorable.nope.
this is ethereum.
and it was goddamn time.
