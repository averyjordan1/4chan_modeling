Where is my $100 LTC
Threads showing off some coin only pop up after the price has bumped up a bit.
Whether it continues to go higher is a gamble.
Idk why people bother to shill at this point.
Yeah maybe by 2 dollars.
Still make better gains in bitcoin or maybe even eth.
>BTC dropping>ETH droppingLast warning faggots.
LTC will become a safe haven for many BTC and ETH holders.
567 LTC reporting in.

Yesterdays high.Yeah, nah, but it was $56 last night, and it seams stable since BTC is having a shit fit.My guess is we'll see $62 then it'll move back down again to $55.
