Will I make it?
not with those shitcoins, sorry anon
Depends.
Are you in this for the long term?
GAS, OMG, REQ, VEN I all believe in long term.
No too sure about the rest.
Yeah I plan on holding all these long term.
I tried trading and just kept losing.
I think I'm going to get out of NULS
bro, why are you even thinking about Alt coins when BCC and BTC are in this shitstorm???
lol ur gonna lose all ur money because this bcc vs btc shit will set crypto into another bear market like what happened in 2013 where bitcoin went down to 1/6th of its valueholding through the top is fucking stupid(this is the top), just sell for bcc short term and get out after the whole bcc pump happens, only coming back in a year or so later
I have been holding these before the shitstorm began.
Plus my thought is whichever coin wins eventually the trading pairs with the respective alts will begin making it all go back to "normal".
Seriously.
Gas????
Is that what you're huffing as well?
Fuck you Josh
Add DigiByte and you are good to go..
no because half of them are shitcoins with autistic people developing on them
GAS is a sold alt.
I do believe the China FUD will end eventually and NEO will be back in the game.
GAS is necessary to run apps on NEO...
Orly?
Can you be more specific as to which you think have a shit team?
I know NULS is prob a shitcoin (planning on getting rid of it soon) and LINK doesn't event have a "team".
All others seem to have a good team and backing.
How do I display my holdings by percentage?
Will I make it?
Hit the theee vertical dots on the top right.
The option is there.
XBC IS HAPPENING
That's a pretty average blockfolio my friend.
Why would you hold a majority of GAS?
If you held that much NEO you would get GAS for free - approx 1 per week
True but I'm thinking post China FUD GAS price will outpace NEO's
