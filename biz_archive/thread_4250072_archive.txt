Stay in fuckin btc, chinks will double this pump when they wake up tonight.Strap in for 8.5k u faggots
HAHAHAHAHAAH u scared it will dump once the news spreads brah?
Keep dreaming, there is no reason for a pump anymore
I got Pajeeted into XVG yesterday and just sold it at a loss because I decided to say fuck it and stay in BTC.
This is the only thing that's really gonna be worth a fuck in the long run and it just shows that the average consumer who doesn't know about this shit is just gonna hear "Bitcoin" like they hear "Coke".
It's BTC or nothing.
Fuck everything else.
HAHHHAHA keep dreaming, btc fag.
your time, for now, is over.
ALT SEASON IS BACK
im all profit and unable to acces kraken, but my exper.
trading crypto tells me this is what will happen, sell now and miss those sweet yellowpredictable gains friendo
This cancelled fork is GOOD news.
Less freaking out over "what if" now.
W0w people were freaking out over the fork and not wanting good news?
U-ur right... they were scared of the free coins thats why they were buying BTC in anticipation for the fork.. Deluded bitcoiner.
The average assfuck doesn't care about fucking alt coins and shit.
No one knew what the aftermath of the fork would be like so people stayed away.
Now that it's off, the average person is just buying more BTC.
ajhaahahahaahaha deluded
I think Asian miners will dump their BTC that they were holding for the fork
hahahahaahha check the price now asshat, this shit is going down hard now that shorts have been squeezed.
Ask anyone on the street if they know what Ethereum is/does.
Everyone is peripherally aware of Bitcoin and it's getting around that it's something they should invest in.
Grandma ain't gonna be using Vertcoin in 10 years...
