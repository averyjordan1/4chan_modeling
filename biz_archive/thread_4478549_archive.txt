Serious discussion, what do you think the floor will be before the team releases new news?
Sergey is shaking out the unfaithful right now as they don’t deserve the kind of gains LINK will deliver.
Absolute floor is .13.
 cents or 1300 sats?
I think 1300 sats is more realistic with a great BTC bull run
 in 3 months with no news is possible, but I don’t see it happening.
