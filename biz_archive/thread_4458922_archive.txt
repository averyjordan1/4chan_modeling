Hey guys, I looked at Confido and it seems like a really nice project, should I get in now?
The price drop is making it look like a nice BUY opportunity.No shilling, tell me the truth!
You fucking retard
I was thinking the same thing!
Warren Buffalo always said buy low sell high!
This is a perfect opportunity for us!
Give it a few days and see what happens I'd say.
This project could be dead in the water for all you know.
Not sure if an ass hole or oblivious
Great team, blockbuster product and constant development.
It has a amazing future, buy now and get lambo, it's super cheap.
Honestly if they get this figured out this actually could be a steal price
Honestly it's already up 16%.
I predict a massive rally as many people attempt to buy in etc.
> I'm not very rich but I put everything I had into this.
I don't know what I'm going to do now.
I haven't told my wife or her son yet and I have no idea how I'm going to explain it.
I feel like life is over.> My wifes sonWhich one of you cheeky cunts posted this on reddit?
Go all inLet that 3rd mortgage think into confido
you know you want to.

The people buying now probably have no idea about the news the released.
Even from his statement, he seems VERY DOUBTFUL about this shit getting figured out.
I'd just exit and take it as a loss and not look back.
There's obviously some serious issues that will take time to fix, if fixable.
