So guys, any way to buy crypto today with fiat?
I need it asap because of upcoming moon tomorrow so can't wait for SEPA transfer, have to use paypal, giftcards or whatever
bitpanda has quick verification if you can show ur id and use credit card
Check Google for any local bitcoin atms and you can buy instantly.
If not the only coin I know you can buy with paypal is Lomocoin.
thanks, guess I will go with thissadly no atms around my country.
Where can i buy lomocoin with paypal?
If you have android download the lomostar app off of google play.
(Use my referal code 15FU3L) Once set up you get set up (and get some free airdrops) Go to the (me) tab and hit the plus button to buy.
You need 1000lmc in order to make a transfer though so need around 50usd atleast.
