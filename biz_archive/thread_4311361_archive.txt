segwit2x was killed.
segwit2x was the solution to Bitcoin scaling as determined by the new York agreement.
Without s2x, Bitcoin has hundreds of thousands of unverified transactions.
Bitcoin can't scale as is.
BCH is the solution.

The day before the segwit2x fork was cancelled, I had a dream where BTC crashed down all the way to 2000.When I woke up, I was incredulous, because it was around 7500 at the time.
However, now I'm not so sure.
If I wanted to listen to some faggots dream I'd watch MLK on youtube not browse biz
