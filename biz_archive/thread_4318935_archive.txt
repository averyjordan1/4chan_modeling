It's hard to blame anybody who was trying to make a quick buck, but did people genuinely believe BCH was going to become the dominant chain and destroy BTC?
Did someone wake up and see $50 fees and think well shit everything is going nuclear better sell off all my holdings in the cryptocurrency that's still used to measure the value of every alt ever?
Not sure but I really really really like this picture.
Mind if I save it?In all honesty though, It scared the shit out of me and I panic sold my BTC at 5680, only to re-buy back at 5660.
I'm sorry for doubting you, my liege.
