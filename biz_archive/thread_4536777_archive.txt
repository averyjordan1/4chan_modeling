i watched this movie, Glengarry Glen Ross, and i don't understand how the "leads" thing work, i know it's contact information of potential buyers, but how and where do they find these potential buyers?
do they just research people with money and shit?
if they have shitty leads then why wasting time with them?
just in the case IF they MAYBE want to buy?
is this legal or morally wrong?
Completing more deals makes the company look better unless the deals are literal poo.
Makes it easier to get better leads and deals
