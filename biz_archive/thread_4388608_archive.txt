Anyone else had dreams about crypto before?
I had a dream that BTC crashed to $4k then within literally minutes crashed to $500 and eventually $100.
This filled my limit order of 10 BTC for $100 each, I was really happy but still scared that it would go from $100 to $1 or less per BTC.I don't really have a limit order for $100 per BTC.
I think this just shows how my subconscious knows there's no real ground supporting BTC and it could collapse at the snap of a whale's finger.
I had a dream ARK would get to 76k back during its last bull run when it was around 48k.
Too bad I sold early.
I also had a dream bitcoin crashed hard which is why bch still makes me nervous.
