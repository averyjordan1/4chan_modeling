Is it easier to make your own mining rig or buy one?
Australian here so any local advice would be greatly appreciated too.
Hahahahahahaha don't bother in Australia, mining is only worth it if you move to China.
Mining is worth it in Australia.
Obviously it's easier to buy someone elses rig than to make one yourself, but you'll probably save money by doing it yourself.
I don't pay for electricity for the next year here either which is why I'm wanting to invest.Are there any good tutorials for how to make a rig?
Cryptomined has made some good tutorials.
If you've built a PC before it's pretty straight forward.
Too easy thanks mate.
its not even worth buying a mining rig.
It will take you 3 years of mining to recover the cost of purchasing the mining rig.
I think you're out of luck.Some of the world biggest miners are based in Aus so you'd have to be competing with them.
yeah it's called fuck off and quit ruining the prices of gpus and ram, faggot
What city?
I can't mine in China
