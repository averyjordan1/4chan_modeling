Do you remember the hype associated with Golem?
In late 2016, Golem was one of the most hyped ICOS behind the infamous DAO.
Earlier in 2017, the token appreciated more than 300% only to depreciate in value as investors expectations were not in alignment with the delivery schedule of Golem.
In other words, Golem failed to deliver on their mission and have left a lot of token holders holding the bag.Meanwhile, IEXEC will be launching a major announcement later today.
I invite you to research more related to IEXEC and its promise.
Thank Anon later.
