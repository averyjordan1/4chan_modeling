Any thoughts on the Dropbox IPO?My guess is it will be hard for all of the MIT-cucks who joined in 2015 and 2016 when they find out their options are worthless.No way the company is worth more than $10 billion.
In reality, it's likely worth significantly less.
Any guesses about the real valuation?
Is this why they brought on confirmed sociopath Quentin Clark as CTO, to deal with the ripped-off engineers?
This is great, stocks and actual business talk are coming back to /biz/!All the scammers are pushing it back hooray!!
Thanks.
Any actual ideas about the IPO though?
