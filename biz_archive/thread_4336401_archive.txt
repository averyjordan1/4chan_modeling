Can we at least agree that out of the two shillcoins REQ is a better choice?
Are you fucking stupid?
You cant be bullish for REQ and not for LINK.
At this rate, REQ will end up using LINK.However you can be bullish for LINK but not REQ.
Maybe if I was retarded i'd agree.
Request will use LINK.
Fuck off low IQ pajeet neckbeard.
No.
fuck you buy link
From a market perspective if you just want a flip REQ will move before LINK.
But long term investment wise you should be bullish on both.
i got a fat stack of both
I'm about 90:10 LINK:REQ Mostly keeping the REQ ratio low because of that stupid bullshit line in their white paper about how they want their system to be used for tens to hundreds of years.
Great, thanks for the enthusiasm ya fuckin kid-o's
