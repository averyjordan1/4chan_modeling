https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/confido/Still cheap and only on ED so far.
When this gets on a real exchange.....full moon!
Locked and loaded.
huuuuuuuge buys
this is no more low market cap retard, for their product few bucks is enough you guys giving 10 mill for 100 lines of code.
dont fall for this shitcoin
it's on kucoin too according to cmc
Great!
Asia seems to have an appetite for Comfydo.
This is actually a solid project.Jesus there are so many shitcoins out there with 25-50 million marketcap.Bunch a greedy fucks asking 30million for their ICO.
Just broke the $10m marketcap barrier.
ETH in ICO are now 50 ETH
there are worse projects with higher marketcaps!This is the same argument as to why LINK wouldn't tank when it was over 100 mil.Look how that turned out.
OP you made me check ED just to make sure I wasn't getting JUSTed.Should've known better.
that's the comfydo difference.
yea, 100 million cap is a big difference.this is at 10mil
Comfydo is so comfy, that even people who bought at 10x are in 2x profits.
What a coin.
That's the Comfydo difference biz.
GOAT ICO of the last few Months!
Should be named to rich in just 1 week.
Ill buy in and it will dip, guaranteed
this no more low market cap now retards, now the dump their bags on noobs who try to buy now on.
Got in at 55 cents
Should I buy more now or wait for it to go back to $.95?
i'm literally a fucking millionairex2 now because of this holy FUCKING SHIT post your addresses biz, i'm giving out 10 btc
It's dropping, selling now, buy the dip
I was going to get in at .000625 but shittrex won't let me withdraw my money.
A sweet 5x I missed again.
If you deliver, I'll share / support with the underground punk / arts scenes of Indonesia, Malaysia, and China, send you photos, LP's.
cassettes, whatever.
do it.

thanks man, i'll pay it back in kisses18nz7vucLE1awRNeg4s9RBT9cdNC8Tpuku
KILL ME NOWi had a whitelist and ignored it
Same here... sucks
I was going to buy last minute, but it would have been 1-2 ETH like everyone, and sold at 8x max like almost everyone.Still sucks but I know myself I would have been mad not buying more on ED and selling at 20x.
I'm new to this.
My first investment was link for 0.25 which I sold at 0.16 to buy BCC for 1.600 just to sell it for 1200, all I did was listen to biz pls help me1HUJtZ4qt4Rs13YNkCpfrWgQZbYyQePRzm
I was stage 2 and went to sleep.
Ive never done an ICO before so I imagine it would have taken me too long and I would have missed it.
Thats what I will keep telling myself.
It sold out in like 30 seconds bro.
High chance you would have.
Don't worry too much about it and ignore every Confido thread you see.
Don't ever check the price either.
Just move on.
#Congrats!1MUS4nZaTmjfqzLwimtKeK8Vs1sgNfEBKaThx
You can go long on Confido like I am or just move on.
