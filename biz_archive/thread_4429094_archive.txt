Poor ass student with 500 bucks, invested 150 in Powr and 300 in Neo kinda bevore the big bumps started, wanted to ask where to invest the rest, i know 50 bucks worth a shit for you guys, but for me its 10% of all I have so far^^, and dont want to throw it out of the window.
Also what does "Fomo" and "shill" mean exactly.
Thx mates
The rest on Bitcoin itself
FOMO = Fear of missing outShilling= Advertising a project beneficial to your own agenda and not in the interest of others.
Or being paid to discuss a project.
you're fucking retarded.
have you ever considered that if you're poor (only have $500) maybe investing in a market as volatile as crypto isn't a smart idea?
get your shit together first, save a little money, do the research and then invest
Depends on how much risk you're willing to take and to be fair, NEO and POWR are solid coins this anon bought into.
POWR is on a steady rise to $2 by EOY
I have 1000 dollars, should I go all in on powr?
what is powr why is it otw to 2 dollars
