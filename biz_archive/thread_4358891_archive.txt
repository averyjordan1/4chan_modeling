Newfag here.I'm kind of struggling economically so I would like to know more about internet currency.
What are your thoughts apo bitcoin-like currency and how do you see it moving forward the next 10years.
Also, can someone actually get bitcoin for free without any dangers?
Nice bait, saged.
If not, learn to google before u ask.
Without any dangersCryptocurrency is still in the "wild west" days - it is very volatile by nature and investment is always risky.
If you're struggling economically, you should work on budgeting and where you can make savings before you think about investments.
Investing should only be done with money that you can afford to lose.
I just wanted your opinions I already made a research and I got different answers, dude.
Calm down.
Made over 200% last week on shitcoins on binance this market is a joke, people just buy up some new listed coin and you get easy instant gains just like that
Nice b8, go back to *reddit.
Crypto is dead.
Fuck off.
