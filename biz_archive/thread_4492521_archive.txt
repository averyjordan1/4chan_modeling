Did I do good ?
I sold all my Litecoin and Ether, kept what I had in alts though and BTC.
Should I convert the alts too ?I feel like we are heading for a crash sooner or later, we haven't had a good one since September
I cashed out 20% onto gdax, but coinbase "temporarily disabled" my account
why cash out?
crashHa you stupid idiot dummy crypto never will crash again.
I should know I've been here at least 3 months
Cash out yesterday at 8280 or something while all the newfag money was being bullish retards bragging about buying at 8100 ectIf you're not atleast taking some profits while btc is flying this high you're a fucking moron.. desu i'm just looking forward to alts coming back to life, i really hate random btc bull runs for nearly 2 fucking months

Dunno, the whole FUD is getting to me, but there are other reasonsLike I said, we haven't had a good crash in some time.
I don't feel confident buying anything nowSecondly, I got quite a few profits during the past 2 weeks, and I want to cash out a little bitThat's the gist of it mostly, I may be wrong but at least I've consolidated my profits.
