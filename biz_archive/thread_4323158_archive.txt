Infinite supply.
It does literally nothing.

The Ripple Foundation owns most of the supply.
They're selling batches of 1 billion coins to banks and financial institutions, but they'll always be in control.Don't buy unless you want to be their slave.

Xrp is being used, and more and more banks are interested.

No, it will make the banks rich.
Anything good for the banks is bad for people.
So do not buy jewish scams.
Replace btc?
You are truly a retard

This is extremely old.
It predates bitcoin by a number of years.
Has been around since mid-2000s.
They very quickly recognized the good and bad points of BTC when they first learned of it.
Integrated the good and discarded the bad.
Same with ETH.
They are going to keep doing this as the coin evolves.
Basically it's the apex predator of digital money.
fidget spinners are not cool anymore
