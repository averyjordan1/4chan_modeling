imagine someone would have to pay for your funeral, no matter what, you are a weight on societies shouldersif you end yourself, do it somewhere nobody can find you body and leave a letter that you go explore the world so nobody tries to find you.
dont jump in front of a train, thats a mess to clean up and delays worthy people in getting to their job in time.
Go somewhere deep into a forest and take a rope with you
Bought COSS at $0.20Same here anon.
Hopefully the ui update stops the price from crashing with no survivors.
