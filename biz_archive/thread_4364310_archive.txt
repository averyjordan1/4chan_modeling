What should I do after I graduate college?
I still live with my parents and I was considering what I should do after graduating this December.
Life has been tough for me bros.
I've been commuting to school for the past 4 years.
My major was in computer engineering and it's been a grind throughout my entire college career.
I'm barely scraping by with a 2.5 and I'll be graduating this semester.
I was still able to pull 3 internships over three summers and put them on my resume.
I'm pretty sure I can easily get a job but I've been struggling to figure out what I want to do so I've held off applying.
I want to desperately leave my parents and find a place to live in my own.
I love my parents and respect them dearly but I just feel the urge to be independent.
I'm still a lossless virgin and I'm turning 22 next year.
I want to rebuild my life from the ground up but I'm not sure where to go from here.
I also don't have many friends.
Any ideas bros?

Start looking for jobs, search for appartement renting, move out, not that hard
similar state as you except no internships and a math / stat degree instead.either I learn to trade or I apply to every bottom of the barrel programming / analyst job because I'm not working in fucking retail after graduating.
I moved to Florida and put $5k into crypto.
Here I Am, 5 months later still trading and not even thinking about getting a job.
