I haven't seen much talk of this one anywhereIs this a shitcoin?
All signs from what I can tell point to it not being a total piece of shit, but I very well could also be retarded.Is it worth adding to the portfolio?
i been watching it, but meh
How I'm feeling, but wanted to see if I was missing something.Outside of the info on the site, which is well put together I'll give them that, nobody seems that interested in it.
Found a bunch of leddit threads either calling it a scam, or jerking themselves off about how it's going to be the next ETH.
Other than that, I could only find is supposedly popular in Japan, but that doesn't mean shit to me.
I think the price will go up eventually.
I just like it because the transaction fee was literally less than penny.
And their wallet can generate a new address.
Just read up about this and am really tempted to go all in.
I'm going to wait a month and see if the price has lowered.
Q2 2018 is the release date for the reward phase so that's when I think it will moon.
Until then it's most likely going to keep dipping.
Yeah, I downloaded the wallet, it looks really nice.
I also did really like the per tx addresses as well.Glad I wasn't the only one that found it tempting.I figure unless /biz/ has any juicy info to redpill the fuck out of me, I'm going to just keep it on the radar.
Will probably pick up some in a few months as it just looks too good to not pump a little.
