>its another episode of btc goes up $700 in a hour killing alts again
Well that was quick.
You're still bitter?
Mona WILL 2x in the next 24 hours.
BTC will not.
Screencap this.
b-b-b-b-b-b-but the fork is cancelled
hahaha, I was about to buy MONA yesterday before the fork was cancelled but ended up not.
I am afraid it will go back to $2.60 until the next big news.
Yeah this for rumor really fucked alt holders and now all the BTC holders don't get free money from the fork which they would put into alts so we got fucked TWICE!!!
They are trying to liquidate shorts you fucking mongs.
Too many people shorted bitcoin the moment the fork was cancelled.
It will drop hard in a few days.
u idiots need to think like the chinese"ruh roh furk cancil wrut???
""damn american pigs already got into alts but LOLdumb americans are selling their btc cheap"* gets on phone"hero Yang?
get min, lee, yin tu, tai, lee2 , sanPark, AI, aiguo, Bai, BO, Boha, Lee3,Aigu, and 5 orders of kimchi we are pumping BTC"
Alts will rise with Buttcoin this time.
Just a small pullback right now.
Nope BTC will definitely go down but not straight away.
Give it a week.
My Alts are up as well.
pump bitcoin by printing more tethers>alts crash due to fomo, pumping the price even harder>new dumb money flows in, permanently increasing the market cap>money flows back into alts, btc crashes>repeatis this what is happening?

I hope so.
I'm excited for every single alt dip because it means big gains in the future
Do you know what the fuck shorting is?
My favorite game
This is some Family Guy-tier humor
