what are some subtle ways we can destroy the Link project?
perhaps we can dox sergey and ellis's family and harass them for scamming us all.
Perhaps we can report them to the SEC as they are US based, and give them legal problems.
I don't really have a skin in the game but I want to see linkies bleed to 2-3 cents just for my own personal recreation.
That would be very pleasing to me.
Don't do it just yet, senpai.
I gotta dump my fucking bags at a fucking ~20% loss.
WAAHHHH MY CHOSEN COIN DIDNT MAKE ME RICH!!!!
ITS OBVIOUSLY THE CEOS FAULT FOR NOT SETTING ME UP WITH A PROPER PND
linkies have been reduced to thisHahahahahahaha.
I saw this coming way before SIBOS.
Your shitcoin is nothing.
I have reported this thread to the proper authorities.
I am an impartial outsider, but I seek to spread maximum pain.
Right now Linkies hopes are crushed.
But now it's time we crush your very soul.
we must destroy the Link project.
