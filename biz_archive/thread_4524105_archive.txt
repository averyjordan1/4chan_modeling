Is now a bad time to buy anything?
Im only really able to spend 1k ATM and don't want to buy at the top really... my options are ETH, XMR and BTG as well as BCH.
I also have some LTC that I'm not sure if I should trade or not.
LTC won't go over 100$, on the other hand, ETH will be 1k$ at the end of the week cap thissss
Stupid fag, this-ing your own post.
wait till the BTC correction.
Just sit on the sideline for now.
XMR already too late
how?

you should be buying shitcoins now.
Thank me later
