But I just bought in an hour ago
Back to 10000 sats now.Can you cucks stop panicking?
Go play a videogame, watch a movie and come back tomorrow pls.
god damn you guys are fucking pathetic, how hard is it to just HODL and ride the wave?
Cheer up anon, its the fun you had on the ride that matters.
this post is fucked up man wtf...
Get in on GVT now guys.
FUCK you have the opportunity to get in something before it MEGA pumps.
How many times are you guys gonna miss something.I, like many others, already took profit.
Heh.
I did the same.
It's the point of stagnation, anon.Many people have cashed out and moved into HST because they believe it will be the next moon mission.Plus, HST is also Australian.
Aussies love and support their coins.I personally will only cash out of POWR after it hits $1 and probably will jump into HST as well.
Sorry I will delete it rn
/Biz/ is filled with nothing but clueless 14 yo faggots raised in the age of instant gratification.
You think all you have to do is put $10 of your allowance on a coin and it will turn into $10,000 in one pump.
for fucks sake, stop trying to get rich instantly and invest in shit that will moon over time.
And by time, I mean several years.
Pro tip: expecting instant gratification in life will set you up to be a depressed emo fag that's ready to eat a bullet after his first girlfriend dumps him.
Learn to practice patience
Fuck this is the most truthful statement I've ever seen in this cesspool.
