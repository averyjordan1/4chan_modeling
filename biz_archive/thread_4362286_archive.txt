Will this get another pump, or is it dead?
Thinking of taking a sizable position at .04.
when the fuck will it be airdropped in bittrex
still using shitrexNobody to blame but yourself dude, they're so 3 months ago.So when it does get airdropped whales should pump it pretty nice to dump their bags, right?
This seems like a safe bet.
Do you know of an exchange that takes BTG deposits?
No Binance is the only one I k ow that even trades it.Anyone think this will pump again?
