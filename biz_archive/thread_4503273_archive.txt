BOUGHT BCH AT ALL TIME HIGH AGAIN!
Don't worry, did the same with NEO.
All time highwhat are you smoking?
whoopsie
Bcorers just coping
Relinquish yourself of greed.
This isn't the ATH lolWhat do you think will happen once BitStamp accepts USD for BCH in December?What do you think will happen when GDAX launches USd for BCH in January?If you hodl you'll be grateful in a few months and think you got in low.
Buy and hold
When will you people learn that you don't buy at resistance levels, you buy when price BREAKS resistance.
When there's no tested resistance, just leave it, there's literally no way of telling what's going to happen then, chasing ATH's is ridiculous.
y tho
Gdax isn't launching anythingThey're just letting you withdraw
i am pretty sure the real reason it went down again is not because of resistance.
but because bithumb went down again.if i tried their website 10 min before it chagned to a simplified version because of high traffic.
It's behaving exactly as s/r predicts.
Those are psychological levels, derived from fundamentals.
Please respond in my other thread so I can collect all the BCH shills/bagholders delusions.
Which is a leg up on all the other shit-coins
 ATH> I don't anything and I just repeat words I read here
