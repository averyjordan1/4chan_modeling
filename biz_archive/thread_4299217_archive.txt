So Comfy If you know what I mean ;)Not much to say atm, only real trade is to go long on some BCHsI am planning to move some profits into MONA, or VTC in the coming weeks... imo the market is looking for the next REAL bitcoin and it may have found it in BCH but there is a chance that some of these smaller cap currencies with some form of adoption already will have greater % gains than BCH.kakakakakaka
