Do you really believe that your shitcoins like ARK, REQ or LINK will be here in 3 years?
I highly doubt it.
There is only one king and always will be - Bitcoin.
Ignoring the hard truth, huh?
$ 823.07
You sure about that buddy?
This is the first year that bitcoin had to face its own hard fork kek.
What makes you so sure its going to survive the BCH threat?
What about monero, litecoin, xrp, ETH?
Hold the good shit and get rich.REQ, LINK, etc will be the next generation of successful alts
Monero, Litecoin & ETH are safe holds.REQ/LINK are 50:50.And don't even get me started on Ripple.ARK could also work out, I would say like 75% success chance
