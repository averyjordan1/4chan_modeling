hey bois, i wasnt sure if i should post this, but i just moved a measly 200 bucks out of bittrex and it seems to have gotten bundled with a MUCH larger transaction than i'm used to.
80 million bucks?
what's going on boys.

According to their ticker, they dealt 62337.1019 BTC volume in the last 24 hours.
That's over 511 million, having a portion of that in a withdrawal shouldn't be too concerning unless it's in Tether.
Congrats anon, help a brother out rich boy.

it's a change address.
to make the exact amount of btc you wanted to withdraw, it had to "break up" a larger bitcoin into 2 pieces - the amount you wanted and the rest.you didn't really own a bitcoin worth $200, since it's an online exchange you basically are just given that much "Credit" of bitcoin in your account out of bittrex's stash.
this isn't an ELI5 thread motherfucker, i get that.
jesus christ.just bittrex moving a fat stash when it's gonna come out in the next few days that tether is insolvent is troubling.
get with the times my dude
