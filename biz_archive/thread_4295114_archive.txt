>scam somebody out of their knife on csgo ($120)>immediately feel guilty - and then after an hour of having it, send it back, apologizing profusely and then blocking him immediately afterwhen did you realize you werent cut out for the /biz/ness world?
Scams are not business, they border on theft.
The exchange is fraudulent - you cheated.And it really tarnishes your reputation in business if you do this.
You did the right thing OP.
Maybe prevented your mark from scamming someone else to recoup the money
Explain Trump University thenAnd many of his other scams
Did this when I was like 10 with a runescape account.
I got this kid to change his password by lying to him about some bonus he'd get by doing it, and later got a message from his older brother asking why I'd done something like that.
I felt really bad and gave it back to him.
Felt good.

Real business is an exchange between willing parties.
Capitalism.
Buying and selling.
As far as trump uni, they didn't deliver the product they were obligated to and deserve the consequences that come with that.
They got sued and they should get sued!
tfw not a goody two-shoes but not really a villain either
Until I found this place I used to be like that, the heart of man is naturally good.But in a capitalist society you become /biz/ naturally.
I thought that until I realized that people strap down and brutally genitally mutilate their own babies.
Then I realized that people are ultimately mostly just dumb sheep with no empathy.
Business is made of mutually beneficial transactions Anon.

I guess so, I don't do that anymore, still feel bad about the people I scammed (except for the chinks).
Just needed to kickstart my crypto thing.

That just proves you're white.
You can still be good at business and not enjoy blatantly stealing from people under false pretense.
