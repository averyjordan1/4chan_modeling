You do realize you're putting your money into companies that have random ass people running them trying to make gains?
I understand holding btc and eth long term but daily trading is essentially gambling with more rake.
If any of you actually used your time wisely you would put your time into learning a sport and capitalizing on the DFS industry.
Tons of idiots making random lineups not knowing what to do just throwing money away.
A lot of you just want to throw money in random alts and shoot for the moon without doing any research though.

sportsball is the future fools
tell me your winning strategies ;)
It's fine anon I'm seriously trying to help you.
I don't even like sports.
But st least you have historical data in different matchups that you can exploit against an average player.
You are literally investing in lottery tickets if you day trade crypto.
Which is also fine but don't pretend it's anything more.

You play mostly cash or tournaments?
