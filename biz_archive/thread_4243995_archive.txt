This was the most shilled coin on biz since January and talk of it's gone utterly silent on here the last 2 weeks.

Erc20 tokens=junk ponzi scheme

It retraced 50% now is when you buy not when the dumb fucks on this board start shilling.

Nothing happening with this for about 4 months.

They've got nothing of substance to release until sometime late next year.
I think the only thing that will pump the price will be confirmed partnerships.
it pumped huge and had a big correction.
it will go up again, but only when big developments happen, which are months off
>This was the most shilled coin on bizFar from it dude.
Take a look at digibyte pre citi award or chainlink pre sibos if you want shilling.They announced partnership with a japanese bank and received 30m in funding for omisego.
Didnt even make the price budge.It went from like 30c to $14 in two months.
Blood for the blood god.
exactly, its dead until next year jim
I sold at 45x ico price
EVX about to slay this bitch
