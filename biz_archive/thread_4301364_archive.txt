With BCHâ€™s price rise, the miners will move away from Legacy Bitcoin, taking away hash power and making block times longer.
Unconfirmed transactions will stack up, and the problems will cascade further from there.
With miners leaving legacy Bitcoin, the profitability will increase for those that remain.
At some point, an equilibrium will be reached, but once legacy Bitcoin has lost its dominant position, the coins will be evaluated on their merit.
BTC will only have inertia on its side and nothing more.
Satoshis true vision shall prevail
Until BCH has their stupid difficulty adjustment is 1 day and 14 hours.
Then legacy bitcoin is 2x more profitable to mine again, and then everyone will realize what a scam this has been.
