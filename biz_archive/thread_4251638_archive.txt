WHY ISN'T THIS SHIT MOONING LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE REEEEEE
Because it went below ICO and bag holders are dumping into the buy pressure.
It'll moon eventually.
It has great use potential and 2018 should see it fly.
It isn't fotm yet
Give it time, more resistance by people looking to get rid at ICO price.
I bought at $0.045, so yea, it mooned pretty good
It went up over 25% already
In a year from now I'm just gonna pretend it never went below ICO
