How do you find altcoins worth investing into?I know technical analysis quite well and was working with it for a living (can share tips), but forall I know after going through Binance's list, there's too many alts to count and most of them are dead.Where do you find coins which are actually swinging or doing something in the long run?
Technical Analysis is meaningless for alts.
To invest in low market cap alts you have to understand the technology, algorithms, and protocols behind the coins.
That and you need to know an intelligent development team when you see one.
Thank you, where do I find this information?
2017 and still falling for the technical analyst meme
Well it worked while I was doing my job.Protip: Timespan - never smaller than 1D.
