Just like most I got Justed by BCHThe difficulty adjustment will be at 706p, GMTOur last hope is to minimize our loses when it surges then.
dont dump early be patient
the flippening, it's happening !!
!bch meme.jpegoh wait
Why would the BCH surge again when difficulty adjust.
Only a little hash will return to BCH with this fork, not as much as before.
Even with all the hash BCH was already falling.
Just like most I got Justed by BCHYou are assuming, boy.I gained massively with BCH.
Tripled my BTC thanks to BCH.
Easy gainz

Just like most I got Justed by BCHLol no, most people weren't stupid enough.Most of the volume was just 2 whales, and most people knew that this was market manipulation and stayed out.Some retards didn't know there was manipulationSome knew, and risked, some gained, some lost.But only a few retards thought this was genuine price rise.I doubt you're one of them
