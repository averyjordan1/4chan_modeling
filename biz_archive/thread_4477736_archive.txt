This, i dont understand why anyone is freaking out... Am I missing something??
Just sold everything at a profit... in fiat now
dunno.
tethers aren't meant to be like bitcoins that are irreversible.
it's under there complete control so they'll freeze and reverse the transaction.
Those tethers are brand new.
Minted yesterday.
Now tether is claiming that they have all been stolen?
Yeah right.
Shady shit is going down at Bitfinex.
> like 50 0 post threads saying TETHER HACK SELL SELL SELL appear on the front page all at once> every one of them starts filling proportionally with id's posting ITS OVER GET OUT RIGHT NOW in caps and the same writing styleYou guya are so fucking transparent.
They think this is the culmination of the grand tether conspiracy, not realizing they "printed" about $30m a few days ago.
Who were those brave anons posting about the tether crash before they could possibly have known the scope of the issue?Anyone have a link to bread?
I think its just this, gonna buy more while its on sale i guess
BCH

DO IT NOW.
MARKET IS DYING OMFG!!!!!
its an excuse to print more tether
SELL YOU FAGGOTS SELL THIS IS THE TOP FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS
Question, Is there ANY way to verify what these kikes are claiming?Could they be stealing 30 million?
nope.
lol I love the last bit - these will not be redeemable for USD.
Umm when was the last time you let people redeem for USD???
https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/WEBSITE IS NOW DOWNTHIS IS A GLOBALIST SMOKESCREENABANDON CRYPTO IMMEDIATELY!!!!
Is this really that bad?
30 million is less than 1% of the total 24 hour volume of BTC.
I really am asking because I don't know much about Tether.
That's what the investigation will prove.Anyhow, it looks like its been flagged and 'frozen' as to speak
Market is dropping not because of this 30M that has been stolen.But because this starts to make a lot of the Tether conspiracy theories look a lot more realistic.
This has nothing to do with the claims of Bitfinex'd.
This is them dealing with stolen Tether, not with problems with the legitimacy of USD reserve funds for USDT created.
a hack is sitll a hack.MTGox made a crash into a bear market for 4 years
If the solution is to print more tethers because the funds can't be reclaimed they are most certainly related.
Go look at Finex hack you moron
Trips?!
The prophecy is true!
Holy fuck ABORT ABORT!!!!
GET THE FUCK OUT WHILE YOU CAN!
How would printing more Tethers to replace what have effectively been destroyed by this attack be related to USD reserve legitimacy?
10 minus 3 plus 3 equals 3.
10 being alleged USD equity of tether.to.
Just print another 30m to compensate the 30m that was supposedly "destroyed"
Looks like they pumped it back in?Tether back at $1 and market seems to be picking back upIs this a trick or are we going downnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn?
Itâ€™s a shill raid
We're at the crest of a of a wave that is about to break and roll back.
Do we all change to FIAT now
They don't need an excuse to print 30m, pal.
And we can observe whether or not they're being used, and if they're not, then they're still sealed.
Honestly, is ETH even a good option now that this thing is out?
I'm thinking that Bitcoin will drop $1,000 in the next few days unless i'm mistaken
