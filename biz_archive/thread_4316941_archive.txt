Welp this whole week has been a fucking fuckaround.My account on Bittrex frozen DESPITE VERIFICATION, and now either Coinbase or my fuckin bank are refusing purchases with my card.On top of all that, last week I sold my BCH.
For a slight profit, but... ugh.The amount of lost opportunity here is sickening me.
I'm usually very level-headed but this has been a nightmare for me.Who else has had their asshole violated by this bull recently?
Me.I hate cryptos
We warned you about Bittrex bro...but they said we were Binance shills
everything is 20/20 in hindsight
