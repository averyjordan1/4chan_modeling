I have a private key leading to a Bitcoin account.
I live in switzerland.
The private key is written on a piece of paper together with a message saying "If don't know what this code means, throw this piece of paper away".
I will hide this piece of paper somewhere in Zürich, Winterthur.1LniSPAWe7usEWuV8qsPGeBC4rv31AnbaLI will put the coordinates to this piece of paper on an App called "Geocache".
Some guy, maybe one of you, will find this treasure.
If it isn't someone of you, I will keep those 2.5 Bitcoins.I'll check it everyday 'til it's found.
Fake and gay
Ok, I'm buying plane ticket to ZurichAre the coordinates up yet?
Not yet.
Putting them on in the next 24 hours.The paper is already hidden.
Well I am going to take a small road trip from Lausanne.
Is it in Winterthour or Zurich ?
I live in Germany.If I go there and find nothing, I'm gonna blitzkrieg your Swiss ass.
and why would you do that?
btw i live 1 hour away from zurich so i'll prob have a look at it.promise you won't stab me while looking for it?
really considering if i should go there.but i have the strange feeling that op will stab me to death if i find it.
found already?
if you're the lucky one who found it, would you maaay consider giving a small portion away to a fellow Swiss guy?
