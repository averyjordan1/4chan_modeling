You have 10 seconds to give me ONE good reason why you aren't investing in this man.
he looks like a fag
le electricity man
monthly burn rate
POWR
he's not me.invest in yourself.buy bcash and link
He threw a crybaby tantrum over a climate deal that made no fucking sense even if you believe in that "settled science".
He doesn't try to make profit Good investment for rich vegans
is there an actual proof that POWR is connected to him?
I will invest in him when I'm ready.
>doesn't make money>keeps going over on cost estimates>keeps delaying>keeps increasing his debtbecause i can read a balance sheet?
Because I'm investing in Bitcoin, so I can buy one of his cars
Lol What the fuck does that mean?
mafia frontmanplebs
this weekly post sucks dude
This dude would be better off lighting a fire and throwing bank notes into it.
He'd lose less money that way than he's losing now.
The guy doesn't even plan to make money.
Owning TSLA stock is equivalent to paying rent for the illusion of living in a sci-fi movie.
It sure is a trendy stocks and good for speculators.
For an investor tho, it's a money pit.
This really turned me off of him.
Complete lack of forethought and logic.
Anon, I am investing.
My taxes are going into this mother fuckerâ€™s pocket!!
his eyes are not equal size thats why
