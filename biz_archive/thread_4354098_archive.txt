BCH has had a stable price for 24 hours now.
This proves it isn't a P&D, the market currently values BCH at around 1200USD, or about 0.2BTC.
We might or may not see the flippening, or perhaps there is enough room on the market for them.
It's not over, core fundamentalists call it a dead P&D shitcoin but that's not correct, if they were right BCH would have returned to its previous price below 500USD.There is heavy price manipulation, bithumb was DDOSed when the price rose, and now bitcoin.com, a pro BCH site run by Roger Ver is being DDOSed.Thread theme song: https://vocaroo.com/i/s0t7Aaa07vAY
BumpIt's been really stable after the panic sell off when all the exchanges started fucking up.
Who knows what would of happened too if the exchanges stayed up.
This shows that its not over for BCC
Remember that Shitcoin Core is the Hillary Clinton of crypto.
Bitcoin Cash will reign supreme in the end.
