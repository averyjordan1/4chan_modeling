Is it really that bad?
Wouldn't it reasonable to buy now while the price is low and wait until it gets higher or is it a (((trap)))?
No once its so low it never recovers, never has a crypto ever recovered in any way shape or form.
buying low?
you trippin bro.
the best strat is to buy high, because at that point a coin has already proven its worth and will only rise higher.
This.
It's like buying ETH for half a dollar when it was just being developed by some autistic Russian meth head.
Are you really going to risk your money on that?
You wait until it's established and you know it's being developed by a Russian genius named Vitalik and is s safe and cheap $300.
You avoid any risk and ensure a profit.
That's how you invest.
If you had bought earlier you could have lost $600 bucks on a meme and been stuck with 1200 worthless ETH.
Hello newfriend
It's probably a trap.
If you buy now you have no proof that it is any good.
Wait a few weeks/months and check now and then if it really holds its outrageous promises.
If it is established you should start buying slowly but remember to dollar cost average over a time frame of a month.
Stop lying and spreading FUD.
Vitalik sounds so good on paper, when you read about him....but then you see him and you can't help but think "I'm investing in a young autist"
why would you want to buy low?
