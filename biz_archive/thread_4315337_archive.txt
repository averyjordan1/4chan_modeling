Korean cryptocurrency communities are now talking about suing the exchange right now.
People lost millions because of this.

this is beyond fucked up
whats funny is that they are the ones manipulating the markets aka scamming others and now look who is getting scammed LUL

Just a possibility.
They're probably manipulating the market to profit this.
where did you read that?, i thought it was just a run of the mill ddos?
Not hacked, just down
Imagine yourself in their shoes, when you see graph and you can do nothing, because your exchange got shut.
No matter how they manipulate, you guys were making money too, by following their actions.
So guess who looses?You too.
there are ~$2500 trades that occurred so some people are clearly that dumb
im sorry but if you bought fucking bch more than 500 dollars above an hourly candles opening price then you deserve to be fucked so you can learn for the future
except i know what they were doing bc im in their fucking chats u idiot i've already sold and made my money and had buy orders at 1100 for the previous dump and ready to dump again
nice larp faggot
Wtf happened?
I fall asleep?
BCH went up to 2.5k then down and the korean exchanged stopped all transactions?!
WTF?
