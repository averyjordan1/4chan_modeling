>tried to profit from something that isn't happening before in 13 hours.The salt of the uninformed fomoers is of infinite supply.
I can understand the people who FOMO'd in during that first "flippening" up to 0.4, for a few hours there it really felt like it was happening.
But can people fall for it again and again and again.
4535721btc is ath and bcc is going down.. imo they are getting ready for the flippering
its not about flipping idiots.
every round they pump floor to +500$, if it happened few times+January coinbase , bch may be around 4000-5000$, then parity.
it seems this universe shares my kind of humour.
My free advice, sub+rdn hold till January.
It's just a joke you fags
I made .7, it's a good coin if you get in and out first.
Believing in it is stupid
it wont happen they wont make any profit this way
BCH will be 4k and then BTC will be 20k.
But also don't forget Bitmex is going to market dump a lot of BCH.
"Bitcoin Cash is not 'losing'""Then what is it doing now?
""Decreasing in value."
They already did.
BCH = 1 BCH
