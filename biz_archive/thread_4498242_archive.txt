whats going on with lrc, should i buy a bunch while its in this dip or avoid
it pumped on expectation of explicit announcement from NEO
avoid NEX will not be using loopring protocoland if NEO is starting NEX what's the point of having LRC?
should have sold as soon as the nex whitepaper dropped.
you got bags bruh
its about to be put on bittrex, would that make it worth buying nowhttps://coindar.org/event/en/Loopring-LRC-Listing-On-Bittrex-218
