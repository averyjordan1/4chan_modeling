I'll buy the dip.
It can't go up like that forever.
I sold right after the ICO LOL
Thanks now I feel better.
I bought at the first ATH (5200 or some shit) then sold at 3800 because I thought it was a chink pnd and it would only get worse.
you deserved to get fucked for not researching into the coin yourself
I did, but it still seemed like it would take a very long time to reach that ATH again and the money would be better spent elsewhere in the meantime.
L0l0l0l as it starts pumping again fucking retarded buy in now youve still got time
If you sold for 2+x profit don't worry about it, yeah you could have made more but 2+x is a crazy return on investment.
Sold 10 minutes ago, took my 150% gains and got out.
Now I wait and see if I was too quick to sell or just in time.
sold at 6k.. fuckit's going to go back down right?
No fucking way dude, not with those candles.
Trying to stay away from FOMO ATH.

Anyone wanna help a poorfag out with a few POWR?0xd4550d4265ae160a1822507f3f3a2bf75e4d9dddWould appreciate one so I can have energy in australia.
Risk just isn't worth the gains at this point.
Might get in if it crashes down by 50%.
I doubt it.
It will fall to 8.5k give or take 1k.
This is the second of a few small pumps leading to a large pump.
This pattern has repeated for days
Dont want BTC, POWR instead?
