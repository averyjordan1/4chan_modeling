I lost $10k on this BCH pump and dump shit but have crafted the perfect plan:>go all in on LINK with what I have left (around $7k)>in two years either I own a lambo or LINK does down and I'll have killed myselfhow is this not the perfect plan?
fuck me, this is it.
well played OP.
this is exactly what i did,
sergey will save us
seriously LInk is the way to go during this entire fuckery with btctrash dramashow all the shitcoins a middle finger by buying LINKSee you on the Neet Lambo meet-up in 2019 OP
I just hope 35 thousand LINK is enough to make it
whats the ticker, don't see it,
LINK plus REQ you god damn foolLiterally youre best options right now
LINK; most user friendly/high volume exchange for it is Binance, though if you have to transfer crypto there use their Ethereum market for the time being.
have 120k link and 130k req.
will i make it?
Nice to see my little stoned doodle getting reposted
its nice
nice work
Is it on the bittrex exchange?
I've only got 2500 LINK and 10k REQI'm probably not gonna make it
k here.
We're all going to make it.
It isn't on Bittrex, Binance is the most high profile exchange it is on.
You're gonna have $200,000 in 2 years anon.
Pretty close to making it.
Just make sure to upgrade your LINK rank every time you make some more money.
LolLook a siacoinIt vas a working product, it's an useful coinIt is worth shitLinkies keep double downing your losses.
You bought the hype.
Deal with it.
Whoever had the big buywall at 2.5 moved it up to 2770, looks like the big money is thinking this won't come down.
We are going to make it right?
This torture will end one day right?
I wont need to rot my life in this 10 hour a day wagecucking job right?
Right?
I plan on using REQ gains to get a new PC to dedicate to a LINK nodenot sure it's a good idea but whatever
siacoinNormie wants to store files on a blockchain.
Normie needs to buy BTC first.
Normie then needs to deposit BTC to an exchange and convert to siacoin.
Normie then needs to withdraw siacoin to his siacoin wallet and pay for file hosting.
Normie can then host files on the siacoin blockchain.Most retarded system ever.
Blockchain storage in general will never take off.
I have placed around $50K on Chainlink at $.20 after I recently sold my business.
I'm willing to wait a few years and see where this takes me.
Because the second option will be the result.
lost 6k on BCH bullshit.I went all in with student loans and now have literally 1.4$ to spend for the whole month.
Cant even pay for food or transport and i need to repay 6k in fucking dept.Ill just kill myself.
Gentlemen,Here is the circulating LINK Marine RANK structure.- General of ChainLink: General Sergey Nazarov- General: 500001+ LINK- Lieutenant General: 250001-500000 LINK- Major General: 175001-250000 LINK- Brigadier General: 125001-175000 LINK- Colonel: 75001-125000 LINK- Lieutenant Colonel: 50001-75000 LINK- Major: 35001-50000 LINK- Captain: 25001-35000 LINK- First Lieutenant: 20001-25000 LINK- Second Lieutenant: 15001-20000 LINKX<><><>X<><><>X- Sergeant Major: 10001-15000 LINK- Master Sergeant: 9001-10000 LINK- Sergeant First Class: 7501-9000 LINK- Staff Sergeant: 5001-7500 LINK- Sergeant: 3501-5000 LINK- Corporal: 1501-3500 LINK- Specialist: 501-1500 LINK- Private: 1-500 LINKWith some daytrading i've increased my stack from 2700 to 5500.
That makes me a Staff Sergeant!
no1 to blame but yourself.
get a job and make it back, it's not too late to make it.
I guess this puts me and a lot of us in very privileged positions.
One of the reasons, I sold my business is that I realize I can actually make more money in a few years in crypto than I can busting my ass and dealing with asshole investors.
You forgot to add Sergei at the top as Supreme Cuck maker, Commander Gerneral MIA

It will take you into a Mental Asylum
If I'm a low volume noob, is this a good coin to invest like $300 in and hodl for a couple of years?Please don't meme to me, I am a poorfag and $300 is a good chunk of money, I can afford to invest long-term but it would suck to outright lose it.
Should I stick to BTC, ETH, XMR or is link actually a good buy in my situation?
All the coins you just listed are good holds, but the only one you're gonna make real money with is Link.
so you get burned in pump and dumpsand decide to go all in on another pump and dump magic box erc20 token.I guess the saying is true after all... a fool and his wealth will soon be departed

So how about 0.1BTC (which I'm already holding), 1XMR, 500LINK How much $ will I have in 3 years?
Yeah, sure Jacopo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enOx5YZ-Uco

>shilling harder as the market action gets hardersuch is the life of salesmen
Call me crazy but expecting a token with 35% current supply and 35% reserved for "other" (e.g.
giving them away to the institutions that will trial them) is not a recipe for mooning.
I'm literally all in REQ and LINK400K LINK950K REQI'm either gonna become an aristocrat or you can find me on the corner sucking dicks.
our rocketship is more a star destroyer than some bullshit passenger craft
Holy shit anon.
I hope you're gonna save some lambos for the rest of us.
expecting to make money by holding LINKJUST
Just hold BCH, you fuck.
I feel sad when I see posts like this and know that I will never be that rich.
fuck off.
that's what, around $50k?
not like both of those coins can go any lower that much anyway.
you'll only miss out on other moon mission but youre still good.
also high chance that you can eventually buy a third world shithole
$120k*
Zap already has a platform up to create your own oracles.
Link is finished.
it has a working productu fokin wot m8dropbox is a working producticloud is a working productskydrive is a working productgoogledrive is a working productyou can't even store 10gb using sia because all your files get corrupted

Thats todays price, how much did the cuck put in originally.Link 400K * $0.17613REQt 900K * $0.05188=$117.1KNoone can be this stupid.
if youre still holding that shit.
He's rich and you are not.
It's clear that he knows what he's doing.
LINK will be the biggest winner we have ever seen since bitcoin and ethereum.
We're gonna win so much we're gonna get tired of winning.
newfag here, is there a platform like Kraken to buy/sell altcoins?
Literally all of them kek.
Bought presale for both coins.
Picked up more REQ when it was down to DCA to .000158 ETH.
Sold and rebought LINK a few times to increase stack slightly, but majority is from presale.
Everyone was making posts about Bitcoin Cashand nobody listened.
Do you remember all those threads warning us Bitcoin Cash will make it?It's just like these Link threads.
I can't find LINK on Bittrex or Kraken, at least not on mobile
This guys the real Picasso ^
I have a few grand in some other shitcoins that I think are promising.
I'm a bad day trader and I'm more comfortable investing long term in projects that I believe in.
You shoudl have asked where to buy shitcoins, not altcoins, big difference.
Ah, where do I buy shitcoins?
LINK is the way to go
your lambo's rear tires are flat anonand your womenz have no hips...are they traps?
I made 6K on the BCH pump and dump, but just like Link, I knew it was a scam.
I knew when to get in, and when to get out.
I posted fud about it for two weeks, but last night I jumped in and made ^k in 2 hours.
Fuck it.
If you idiots wont listen to me, I don't feel bad about taking your money.
Binance, but you said what exchanges are like kraken, my point is all exchanges.
What you asked is sort of like 'what chickens are similar to birds?'
they're all birds.
Link is not a shitcoin, but it is listed on Coss.io
*6k

4321541I think it's YOU who's going to an heroWhen you realise you ignored the deal of the century for weeks on end and wait in vain for a dip that never comes
you're gonna lose it all
as a link holder, this bullshit has been fucking me over for weeks.
dunno how this is heroic.
