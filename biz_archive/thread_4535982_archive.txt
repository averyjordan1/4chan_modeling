So hear me out biz.
First privacy tokens were big, then it was big circ supply like xrp/dgb, then it was smart contracts, then chinese tokens, and the next one I have here, is aussie coins.
There are only two currentyly in EXISTENCE both promising projects.
One is valued over 200 million dollars and the other is under 20 million dollars.
Are you catching on yet?
Mfw all in hst
I missed POWR because apparently my Ausbros didn't shill it hard enough.
But I'm in on HST.
Oi oi oi.
I only made 2x gains on POWR, but 3x (and counting) on HST.
Lets see where these ships go
it's not even an aussie thing i dont think.
it's just people wanting to invest in coins that have an actual use w/ real partnerships and high potential.
simple, easy, no bullshit
Got my best gains from powr, now have a good chunk in HST, all seems good right now
Where to buy HST dard?
Etherdelta, Kucoin, Cryptopia
You forgot about the mightiest aussie coin of them all:ClearPoll
I'm balls deep in this bitch.
Already up more than 100% but I WILL NOT SELL BELOW $2.This is a coin which will suddenly skyrocket.>AMA with cryptonigger on 1 Dec>Partnerships and United Nations-related announcements next week>BINANCE listing soonYou're literally retarded if your portfolio is not at least 75% HST.
What are your expectations for short and long term?
Back to the telegram retards.This shit is a scam.
I always try to keep a conservative expectation with any coin.I used to expect HST to hit at least $1 before EOY, but last night the admin on telegram said that "they are working on Binance".
So now my expectation with HST is at least $2 before EOY.Join the telegram and ask him yourself, if you don't believe me: t.me/horizonstate
Fuck off pajeet
You salty 'cause you missed this at $0.10 last week?Don't worry, rakesh.
You're not too late.
Get in now.
This coin will go bananas next month.
