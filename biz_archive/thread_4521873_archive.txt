My fellow /biz/ anons, there has been some news about HUSH being soon listed on Bittrex at the end of this month, and the price is up 20%.
How do you feel about this?
Anybody looking into this?
What is the strength and potentia of this so-called privacy coin?
It's less than 10M market cap, so huge potential?
Do you have any insights?
Thank you!
its yet another fork of zcash
So you mean, unlikely to go anywhere really satisfying in terms of price appreciation?
Yes.
It is another fork of Zcash.
Just like ZEN.
One of the members of the Zcash dev team, David Mercer, is now the lead dev for Hush.https://bittox.com/2017/11/23/leaked-hush-coin-listed-bittrex-end-november/
;;;but are yyyou bullish for this coin?
To me the 20% increase just because it will be listed on bittrex seem to be a bit overpriced.
Does price increase that much after listing on bittrex?
Any idea?
