It'll moon, but first it has to drop to like 1k sat.
it's literally mooned twice in the last three weeks.
are you dumb?
Uh, XRP already had its moon mission.Check charts and Zoom out.
it 40xed and made people millionairesWhat made you think it would have another one so soon?Dump if you're trying to get rich fast.
No the fuck it didn't.
You guys need to raise your standards.
Going up XX for 1 hour is not "mooning."
dont do this, XRP is a pure scam, its made so that the modern day banking can enter the crypto world and try to maintain the power grasp they already have.
if any part of you thinks that crypto is worthless internet coins that that have zero value then you should be thinking of ripple
dump, invest in XLM+Link - aka the only public assets that will be part of IBMs enterprise hyperledger, future industry standard
4487262the one time it ever mooned it went straight back down, compared to the rest of the market this year you would have made fuck all if you brought and HODL'd ripple
waiting for XRP to moon
