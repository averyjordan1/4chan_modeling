This faggot game hasn't been fun since August, when neo gave me some life changing money thanks to you guys.
Since then, /biz has been a piece of shit and full of faggot scammers instead of helping /bizros out of wagecucking.
BTC is the only one that matters long term and telegrams are where the real info is now.
Too much new faggotry has invaded what was once a good /biz.

I also made money on NEO and went into LINK.

this is the play to make.
Wish I had put $200 bucks on ANS instead of $20.
Oh well.
Haha yes I completely agree it's a shilling board nowadays.
Mostly filled with LINK and other shitico bagholders trying to sell their heavy heavy bags.
biz has always been shitLink will make us filthy rich though
