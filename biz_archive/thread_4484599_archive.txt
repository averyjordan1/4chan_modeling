Hey /b/iz/I got buttfucked by SOLR yesterday, and I have the flu so I'll be alone for Thanksgiving.
Can someone tell me some portfolio recovery stories?
I don't want to hold this bag
>listening to shillstsk tsk
I bought a while back on advice of someone IRL because of coming news from them along with PBC clues.
It was well founded, researched, and wrongI guess I should've stuck to buying rumors and selling news
A story of how I recovered, I bought POWR early and didn't listen to the SLR shills, the end.
One thing to note is your decision to gamble on still holding SLR coin when the PBC comes out is a stupid idea.
You sell before the PBC comes out.
I profited on powr and moved more into SOLR from that.
I still have some POWR but whatever.
chasing pump and dumpsI love seeing you kiddos getting burned.
tough luck to still be holding slr then, just cut your losses and call it a stupid move to keep holding it
