Alright guys,I've made 125% in the last month or so mostly just trading between BTC and other main cryptos but I just missed a big spike in BCH and XRP so looking to put about $300 into an alt coin to make 10%< in the next day or so.
Just to keep me entertained.
Suggest me a coin /biz/ and don't shill me LINK you fucks
ETH.
Try again plz
Swingtrade powr
you're gonna miss out on $800 eth
It's never going to 800.
Don't buy at the ATH because of FOMO
Have I missed powr, I saw the hype a few days ago but it looks gone now
Screenshot it and look at it by march 2018
