After many memes and hype I've finally been shilled into buying Link what should I expect?
pic related it's my expectations.
You chose a good time to get it unironically.
It's been at this ~16 cent floor for a while and hasn't really moved as much as it should have considering BTC's concurrent bull run.
It's likely to naturally correct in response to the current bear tone of BTC (it already has corrected somewhat, 1.5x ico USD price https://icodrops.com/chainlink/), and getting into a coin as well recieved as this one (lots of people saying it has potential, Sergey has actually been one of the more active devs in terms of attending talks even though he's now looking like a human trashbag) before it's listen on The Big Two exchanges is almost certainly a good thing.
Buy.
Put on Ledger.
Check back in two years.
