I think tomorrow but Idk I refreshed it and then it was deleted.Doesn't sound like much at first sight, but it actually is.
Buy my bags the musical, staring OP
Mbah.
I do want it to go up but it's not because of that.
Average entry is 30-31.
I saw it too and just bought in.
not leak official Kucoin announcement artard moon time boys !!!!
Idiot here, why is this important?
Is Kucoin that big?
go to it its niiiceee
Dosen't matter that much, would be big if they were added to some non-gook exchange, i.e.
trex/polo/kraken.
The overlap between users between binance/kucoin is probably very big.STILL, good news.
live meme better than a dead meme imr??
It's official!
more exchanges is always good i guess to an extent but why people are posting threads because of fucking kucoin is beyond mealso fuck white people and i love seeing my wife get fucked by black bulls

Underrated exchange imo,
I've never used KuCoin, is it any good?
4391225Pic related.Yeah Kucoin is actually pretty decent.
I used it when RPX came out, and I would use it over Binance except that it has less choice.
Sort of.
It will be a lot better once it has some more coins on it.
