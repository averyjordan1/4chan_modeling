Looking to do some rebalancing.

all in LINK

Dont take advice frm these fkn retards they have 50 bucks to their name
yeah I do feel like I have too many coins.
I'm thinking BTC, ETH, NEO, ARK, SALTBut I do like having ~10% in possible moonshots.
I definitely fell for the BNT and ICN hype.
Majority in Neo, Ark, Monero and BTC
Thats almost mine Porto hehe, only i got some ETP with it for the moonshot you described Do some research on ETP dude will be huge
More OMG
 No KNC
says the moron who couldn't give any advice himself
This is the portfolio for non retard spergs.
Just forget and come back to money in a year
