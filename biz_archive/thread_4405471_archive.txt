Don't forget to buy the dip

someone post the picture of this girl but pregnant with an ark baby
should I sell my ETC / ETH and buy up ARK?
I have about $1,000 in those two and they haven't been doing much lately
the chance of ETH going 5-10x to 50x in 1 month is almost zero, with ARK it's almost gdt.
what does gdt stand for
guaranteed ^_^
guaranteed okay I'll sell off my ETH and get more ARK
don't forget to stake a delegate, 10% annual earning, payouts daily/weekly/monthly, depending of your choice of delegate and setting if they offer it
DON'T RUSH ARKEIS.
ALL THIS COIN DOES IS DIP SO YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME
already 5% up since i posted
Yeah biz_classic if you have any loyalty.
Only have 3250, how fucked am I in Q1 2019?
Where to buy?
EXODUS exchange does not work.
Bittrex with BTC, on binance you can buy it with ETH and BTC, just check coinmarketcap, click on coin and then market... those are fundamentals son..
I can't afford to buy morewhen the hell is the moon
I have 100 ark.
Is dat enough?
do you see dinosaurs on the earth?
they've missed the ark too, and so will you
BCH FTW
People think this is going to be a 100+ coin by EOY 2018, but there's also people who think 1 ETH will be worth 100,000 in 5 years (Forbes writers)
