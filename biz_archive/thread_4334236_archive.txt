The sold the bitcoin I bought at $7400 for bitcoin cash yesterday at $2200.
What the FUCK.
These are my life savings you assholes are playing with.WHY did everyone say it's going to $3000?
WHY the fuck did everyone say there was going to be a flippening??
I just wanna be rich so I'm throwing tens of thousands around, for this BULLSHIT.
I THOUGHT I HAD A BREAK.
what's what you get for being greedy and not working hard for your money
K 100 Justd bought.
Nice.
Thanks for the free money bro
You have to be retarded to believe in the flippening.
Crypto isn't for you.
It took me YEARS to save up the money that I put into this.
I also put 2 bitcoin into BAT when you guys were shilling the fuck outta it back in early October.
Not to mention my fucking heavy Sia bags.
This place is a prison and these people aren't your friends.
Nobody said the flippening was going to happen today, bud....Keep holding :DDDD
You did it all wrong.First don't listen to anybody, don't rely on anything (even less on /biz/)Don't fucking play with your life savings, only play with what you can afford to loose.But in the end it's well done for you, greedy bastard.
Thanks for your money btw
HAHAHAHAHA YOU FUCKING RETARD
You own fault for forsaking the King.Bend the knee, faggot.
REMEMBER WHEN SIGT WAS BEING SHILLED TO NO END WHEN IT WAS 12-14 CENTS?
Now it's less than a penny!Why do you do this to me?
AHHHH
throws 10s of gs at what people shill on biz>surprised it didnt work out>after so many examples of things being shilled here not working outYou honestly deserve this.
You're the one playing with your life savings dumbass.
>left over bch from fork sold 500 bch at 2000>sold the 490 for 1200-1500 range.when bch bottoms im buying 400ish back into it.
Fuck me bch is such a good hodl coin.

stop being so naive and trusting an anonymous anime board.
everyone has an agenda, including me its up to u to figure out what that is and how to use it for your benefit
Post your address, I'll donate some coin to ease your pains
Good time to buy more!!!
It can only go up from here bud!
/thread.just hold btc man, don't buy alts or any other shilled shitcoin and don't chase pumps.
BTC will eventually stabilize and the volatility will fade.
you will make back what you lost but it will take a while.
BTC address: 1Gs3Ldf19LKxvVMvRBThF6kezfs4f4wVVSThanks Anon.
I'll need to use this board for entertainment purposes rather than actual investment advice.
Somehow you guys were right about Confido going up, yet I didn't put money into that.
Scalp the hype, hold the king.
never ever buy coins that went up 50% + in a day.
thats called buying the top, or also called buying the pump and then getting dumped.
if you see a coin mooning.
chances are you already missed out.
the best is to buy the dip.
always buy the dip.
and when u see ppl start to shill about mooning then its time to sell atleast half,
Top fucking kek
...I was joking.
Did you see my pic?SighI lost like 50% on BCH too.
You're not alone in this, anon.
We'll make it back, don't worry.
heavy Sia bagsThe bags aren't heavy anymore when the value is gone.
Open the bag---NOTHING INSIDE AHAHAHAHA
I'm sorry op, but how can you be so fucking stupid?Do you just do everything biz says?
Because the track record is pretty fucked...
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH........ AAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAH "i'll need to use this board for entertainment purposes" tfw you are the entertainment AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
I know that feel bro, traded my BTC I bought at 7100 for BCH at .27 sats, got rekt and sold at a loss at .20At least 3k down the drain.
WHY DO YOU GUYS SHILL COINS ONLY AFTER THEY'VE MOONED??
4334236HAHAHA, you're retarded.
You gambled, you lost, now you rest.
top fucking kek
WHY DO YOU BUY COINS AFTER THEY MOON.
LITERALLY 95% OF COINS THAT ARE SHILLED HERE ARE USELESS.
THE PAIN
I WENT ALL IN AT 2300...
I CANT PAY MY RENT HOLY FUCK.
IM GONNA BE HOMELESS HOLY MOTHER FUCKER

You played with fire when you bought in to BCH, didn't know what was going on and HELD....
man you deserve this.
buy a low cap coin and reap the gains over 2-3 months.
fuck were you listening to biz on BTC/BCH drama??
Literally a recipe for disaster unless you were in at the beginning of the pump.
You either:a.)
buy ICO.
b.)
buy sub ICO or c.) buy something with FUCKING FUNDEMENTALS WHICH NEITHER BTC OR BCH HAS.
low cap coin> buy something with FUCKING FUNDEMENTALSOkay, I'm gonna go all in with Ark.

 read You're welcome
ONE NOTHING WRONG WITH ME
oy vey goy that's not how you make money
i've been seeing ark shilled hard on biz a lot lately.
stay the fuck away from that.
ALL IN HST thank me later.
Ark is being shilled because a lot of people here already own it.
I think I'd wanna get it because it has fundamentals and is no where close to it's ATH.
rip
BTC just had a double bottom.
I think we're about to moon.
I already sold for ARK, and am downloading the web wallet.
Screenshot this so you guys can laugh if it crashes.
