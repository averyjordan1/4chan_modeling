Post your bags, those coins which are dead and buried but not sold.For me: 1000 ZRX 15000 DNT 500 LINK 50 STRAT 200 UBQ
Holding ARN, feeling like a retard
SIGT from 12 cents.
Are you me?
I literally hold all of these in close amounts, except for DNT.We are so JUST'd by the way.
I for one lost more than half of my entry BTC in each.
No way all of these 2x.
That's at least half by the way.
My average entry point in STRAT, for instance, is 140k.
I don't even care anymore, it's just money gone to me.
TNT from 15 cents
