I'm trying to start accumulating some Chainlink, I'm going to try to buy maybe 1000, whatever my left over student aid can get me.
If any one is in a good mood, can you help me out getting started?

No.
If you're going to beg, have the decency of posting a time-stamped pic of a spoon in your butt first.
You want a wooden spoon?
That's the best I can do
