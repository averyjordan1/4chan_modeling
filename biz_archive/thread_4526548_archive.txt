Anyone else?
I feel like this is going to 100$ sooner or later.
it's called delusion and you should seek psychiatric help.
Don’t know bout that 100 bucks but I think something between 10-30$ may occur in 2018
Feel the same way anon, I’m genuinely excited about the mobile wallet release due to how high the bar has been set with arks desktop wallet.I’ve literally never held any altcoin more than a month apart from ark..
>i feel like this is going to $100 sooner or laterno, i will be happy if it ever reaches $20
yeah same, I'm still mad that I sold my 20k ark at 0.65$ just before the pump lmao.
I'm never selling again
why is smartbridge and ‘push-button’ blockchains better than Lisk’s sidechains?Obviously I sold all my Lsk after The Stuttering a few days ago..Why should I pick up Ark?
Lisk is about sidechains and decentralized apps.
ARK is about a smartbridge between other existing blockchains.Key personalities of Lisk and Crypti are now working for ark.
