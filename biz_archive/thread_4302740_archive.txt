Ya, that's because btc is crashing, not because LTC is going up.BTC pairs are stupid
thisjust convert to your countries currencyits the only way to truly know what you're holding
that is true, but it rising faster than btc is falling
people are starting to realize how shit btc has become in terms of transactions so they'd rather hold litecoin
