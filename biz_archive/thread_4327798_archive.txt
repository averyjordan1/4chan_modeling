The great thing about bitcoin is that it's free from government interference.OOHH GOVERNMENT HELPPPPPP
On /r/bitcoin they were asking if they could sue Bitcoin Cash or Roger Ver for their losses.
it already mysteriously shutdown yesterday just as BCH hit .5 BTC lmao

BCC is the Trump coin its supporters are russiansTop kek, the corecuck coin really is the hillary clinton of crypto, and corecucks are the mindless brainwashed hillary supporters

Some Corecucks on reddit were asking for SEC intervention.
Talking about market manipulation.
Wasn't that the tard who boasted about getting out just under $700?
This dude is corecuck alphaoh god please link, I hate those fucking shit sucking fags
What are you going to do if we find out the pump really was fraudulent?
are these the same people who were right about the election?HOLY SHIT JUST BOUGHT 100K!
High BTC tx fees and normies getting stuck in unconfirmed limbo are the grand redpills.BTC is just another globalist institution like the International Monetary Fund.
BCH is the true coin of Satoshi's vision.We're going to see massive salt explosions and pink wojacks everywhere, it will be like Trump's election all over again.
Feels good man.
BCH is the true coin of Satoshi's vision.Not if they're willing to fork it to make the thing more attractive to miners just a day after a difficulty adjustment.
Both are centralized
the pump was fraudulentI don't think you know what you're saying.
For those of us who cashed out 1900$+ we're gonna sit here /comfy/ and watch the world burn

What are you going to do if we find out the pump really was fraudulent?Was it Russian hackers?
Sweetie, it's time to stop posting...
This reminds me of The DAO, when all the "code is law" redditors suddenly wanted the gov to step in.
What losses?Lots of reddit bitcucks hold +1000s of btc.They received 1 free BCH for each bitcoin...Do the math
Almost all of them sold them.
Guaranteed.
People who have been on /bitcoin for awhile, yeah.
But their userbase and subcount has increased a lot and its not people who have been in for more than a couple months that were trying to jump in.
Someone was buying at the top.
Since August a lot of these spergs sold off their 'joke' BCH and smugly bragged about how they got free money.
It's going to be hilarious to watch them drown.
OMG people actually thinking that Bitcoin should be a state regulated institution.
Jesus christ guys, invest in some stocks instead of trying to kike up cryptocurrency.
4328151Yep.
You can see the dump the moment some exchanges have BCH.
A lot of people dumped.
/r/bitcoin is a mix of delusion and a salt mine right now.
Oh boy, here we go.
