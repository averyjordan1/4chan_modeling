Lets say LINK moons, just how much mooning is likely my fellow Linkies.
Are we talking about LTC and NEO levels?
Ripple?
ETH?Timeframe is EOY 2019.
What is a serious valuation if everything goes well?
So many brokefags are holding LINK that the sell pressure can't let it moon more than 2x before it gets slammed back down.
Until the bags are distributed to more people, the sell pressure will cockblock LINK forever.
Are you fucking stupid?
The assumption is that everything goes well by 2019.
Without new exchanges, it's gonna sit <=.001 forever.
if swift and other big names start using link, it WILL moon to $20
EOY 2019 should have the network up and running to a substantial degree.
If it's not working on at least some serious level by then, we're probably fucked.
But say it is working, it will be the premier Oracle service.
There is zero reason why a business would use a centralised oracle service in place of a trustless one, and considering LINKs FMA, its existing industry connections and its level of development, there's no reason to think that LINK won't have a HUGE proportion of the oracle market.Smart contracts will be massive, ChainLink will be the #1 way to move data to and from Blockchains, and the valuation of the billion tokens will incorporate not just the transactional value of the tokens, but wider speculation as well.EOY 2019 could potentially see LINKs market cap as half of ETHs current one.
Which is around $15 billion.
Divide between a billion tokens and that gives you $15 a token, or around 45x gains.Factor in, however, that a single announcement from a single major player could shoot it far higher.
If LINK is the default solution for, say, BNP Paribas, who hold assets of $2 trillion and who supplied banking data to ChainLink for the SIBOS demo, then the sky is really the limit.$100 a token is not impossible within 10-15 years.
