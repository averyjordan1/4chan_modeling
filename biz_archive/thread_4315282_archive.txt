This is the safest place to park your money right now.
actually no.
unironically its tether lmao
This is probably the only time one can appreciate the stability of this coin, this looks very good for Ether right now
falsetether is sketchy as fuck
yah it just dropped from 314 to 297much safe.
very stable
Already moved to ETH
I took the gains I got from BCH and stored them in LINK.
Itâ€™s not going any higher than 3k sats and any lower than 2.5k.
Tether pairs tend to be lower value than the actual real rate
Ya it does that once a week
Ethereum has unironically literally made bitcoin and bitcoin cash obsolete
If u want to store your money and gain money go for the ltc xmr neo split
