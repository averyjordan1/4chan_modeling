explain to me why is this shitcoin still above $10?
Why must ETH suffer because of some shitty wallet?
If you stick with KING MEW, all will be fine.
im eth newbie....still learning
Solidity is shitty and this is a symptom of that.
Hopefully this will make them speed up development of a replacement.
So tell me if this is correct:Until master Vitalik hardforks eth or applies some kind of fix, some peoples money got locked forever in some crappy wallet?WTF is this shit?
smart contracts
Yup.
Someone coded a shitty contract for multisig, money is lost forever (except in case of hardfork which I really hope does not happen).The shitty contract is at least in part because of the language it was written in, several replacements are being developed (which is what I hope they speed up).
To be clear there was no Ethereum bug, the contract is the problem.
kek, so it's true, that's beyond retarded
Gavin really dropped the ball with Parity wallet... and all because he doesnt develop himself anylonger.
He just grabbed the money and gtfoed opening ethereum related companies.
Vitalik still spends a shitload of time coding.
I dont believe in that.
Ethereum allows this kind of shit and it needs a hard-fork to fix, totally at fault
So 1 shitty dev locked other peoples money.And we are talking about millions of dollars here.Maybe he did this on purpose or just for the lulz, who knows?I'm just glad that I don't hold any ETH right now.
