Reminder than Digibyte is going to pump this Friday with the launch of the DigiByte Foundation website.
You have been warned.
>telling /biz/ to buy lowthey will never learn OP
nice just bought 100k
This will be the 4th time I say this now.
Ahem... it will not pump, and if it does, it'll rise a little bit and then be dumped lower than the price it started.
I have been right everytime considering this coin, and a measly website has never caused a massive pump for any coin.
You should have got out when you had the chance.
I made 500% on this piece of shit, by knowing when to hold and when to fold.
I hope for your sake that you don't get trapped.
