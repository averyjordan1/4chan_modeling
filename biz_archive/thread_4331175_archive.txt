I'm quitting crypto.
I've chased pump after pump after pump for the past two weeks and am down from 8 BTC mid October to 2 BTC right now.I split my meager BTC left between Link and Req, 40k Link and 100k Req.
I'll be back next summer while I work on improving myself as a person.
I will miss you guys, and the memes.
How rich will I be in June 2018?
It's very easy to lose money chasing pumps.
You have to be ahead of the whales, not behind them.
good luck anon.Hold REQ and you will make it.
All top 10 coins went over 10X compared to November 2016.
If you believe LINK and REQ are good coins with actual value, and if a little luck is on your side, I don't see why they couldn't repeat that performance or even more.
So you'll probably have anywhere between 1000% and 3000% ROI by November 2018.
Good luck OP.Look up Jordan Peterson for some self-improvement stuff.
How rich will I be in June 2018?You'd be richer with stocks.
The bubble is popping.
The end is near.
Stocks are the biggest bubble on the planet but I'm already maxing out my 401k.
I'll probably just start saving money now to finally move out of my parents house instead of being a degenerate gambler.
The field is more competitive.
Chasing pump is stupid, more and more players are happy with 10% before they sell.
Plus these last two months are pretty bad for Alt.
