Adding trades to Blockfolio is a real pain in the ass>buy ARK with ETH>previously bought ARK with BTC>have to convert the current ARK/ETH price into ARK/BTC>this shit is annoyingI'm a brainlet, am I just using the app wrong?
You can just add different pairs... you don't need to convert it manually, blockfolio automatically shows your B and $ balance.
Oh it does?
Sweet lord.
My life just changed.
I can put the shotgun back into the corner again.
It will then show the currencies twice in your overview.
Would be nice if you could merge them together...
Yeah, that is kinda annoying.
