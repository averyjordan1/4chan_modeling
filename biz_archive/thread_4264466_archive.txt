$ in medical bills from taking a tainted fish oil pill for 6 months and no one could figure out what was wrong with me.
kept going to all different doctors and shit and eventually figured it out myself.

i sort of gave up on paying it.

Got in at 0.00095, out at 0.0022, wish I woke earlier to get in at 0.00013 like some people
Got in at ICO, sold 3.8k tokens at 0.0024, the rest I'm still holding at the moment
