One reason not to dump?
dions bro
literally two weeks for DIONS.
Why sell now?
I got nothing... this shit is literally worthless, nobody will ever user it in the real world.
Nigga, I have been hearing about dions bro since October and all they was slide lower.
dions bro dions!
!the real reason is nobody is going to buy your shitcoin so you can't dump it
This is the shittest of the coins I've ever bought, the dev team is very incompetent.
Sell it while you can.
