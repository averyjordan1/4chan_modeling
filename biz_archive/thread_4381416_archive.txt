I want to put some swing trading gains away into a time capsule.
$4,000 - will not touch for exactly 1 year.
btc $2000eth $1000 link $250 xlm $250xmr $250 ark $250 Thoughts?
Remove link, xlm and xmr and get some xrp and syscoin.
Not sure about Ark ..
keep link.
get rid of xlm.
take 500 -1000 out of btc or eth.
put that into neo.
get some xrp and syscoinBeing this retarded
Sell me on syscoin.
I don't believe it has any more room to grow as it has been slow to gain any traction in use.
Ripple... just no.
Drop the Link, 100$ on XLM, no more.400 left over add to XMR position or get some IOTA once it drops a bit again.
