I can't seem to make any money- I am not a day trader but I do like to make intra-day swings occasionally.
However, I keep messing up.
If I cut losses, the coin usually recovers.
If I get some profit and sell, the shit moons.
(Sold BCH at 0.9, Dash at .05, XMR at 0.015 and Antshares before it became NEO) If I take losses and hold, BTC rallies and get left holding bags forever.
I don't understand what I am doing wrong.
I choose the right coins but I can't make proper trade if my life depended on it.
Please help.
do the opposite of what you want to do and you'll be rich
You can't choose them all.
You see on biz shill so many coins, you think they're all winners?
HA they're only winner for some time, its your timing thats wrong, you buy and sell at the right time.
whats so hard about buy low sell high?
Too diversified.
Concentrate on 5-6 max and work on your entry/exit timing+FOMO/greed.
