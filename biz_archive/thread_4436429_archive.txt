>when you almost begin to AAAAA but you remember that you use bittrex, not bitfinex
Bittrex is gonna be in the shit too.
It might not die, but it'll be hit.
Many exchanges are going affected since many use Tether.
It'll be a domino effect when this shit implodes.Keep your shit in private wallets.
What exchanges do you use?
where else?
What are thosetell me more
Oh shit, Bch' gonna pump then
Mainly Bittrex binance but I buy on all of them except bitfinex
I've been on bitfinex all day long zero problems What are you autists carrying on about
bittrex although i don't like it much.binance, hitbtc sometimes, etherdelta when i musti hate bitfinex, poloniex, and bittrex quite a bit though
I'm referring to wallets which you own the private keys to.
For example, from a wallet generator or a lite wallet.
Or if you want to be extreme but absolute certain only YOU know your private key, use the Core wallet.
>Mt Gox>Cryptsy>that Mint one (fuck me.
Lost $500 there and can't even remember the name)>BTCebitfinex can't be going down.I have no coin on it.and have never used it.Only exchanges where I have money can fail.
