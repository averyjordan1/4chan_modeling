Im a stock broker who just found out about this crypto stuff a few weeks ago.the group im with have been buying up BCC, WAVES, LSK, and YOB2X (this one is fun)we are going to try and drop prices down by about 20-30% more before they get pumped the fuck up (have been spreading disinfo at exchanges, especially yobit, where we've been manipulating whales) to buy up as much as we can>why you might askCME not only will be doing futures for BTC, but about 15 major coins...also a whale at yobit (placebo1977) is the competing holder of yob2x, he has hundreds if not thousands in their investbox, and is selling the daily interest to lower price to get ready for this future trading.after seeing his and their bots in action (even though we can manipulate even that kek) i thought id help some regular peopleyoure welcome and take this as you may
