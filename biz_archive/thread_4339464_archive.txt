BTH found a bottom at $1000, now it is climbing and the gooks are about to go to sleep.
Just wait until they wake up.
Also, look at that hash rate.....
You mean this pic?
Bch got btfo hard mode

Hi Hedge fund manager here from the other thread I made.My predictions between now and fork in 5 hours is bitcoin ATH 6800, maybe two more times to get BCH close to 1000 - won't go below 1000.
Can't believe the amount of shit on /biz/ right now.
BCH will reign superior in the next 24 hours.
bost broof
Are you sure?
You might want to check pic related faggot
fuckwhit ive been explaining this shit all day, go look up what forks doing, chinese temp mining to bring btc unconfirmed transactions 100K+ down so ppl can liquidate, blah, blah, blah, im done trying to help ppl on /biz/
That site doesn't take into account the upcoming fork to remove the EDA from BCH, it's just a raw measurement of hashrate.
That pic only shows how the market is being manipulated.
In 4 hours BTH will get it's mining difficulty update and the miners might as well swing back just as hard.
