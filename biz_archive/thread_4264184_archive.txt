Several of my sources within the banking sector shared their expressed interest within crypto-currency and have shared that many banks are secretly buying altcoins as a way to capture the mixed gains on bitcoin.
They have also informed me that altcoins that have passed the Howey Test will be the projects yielding the highest returns beginning before the year ends.
Brace yourselves brethren.
Praise Kek!

I've been told Ethereum could rise to a few thousand sometime 2018.
But I have direct knowledge that several family offices are beginning to make otc purchases in iexec, loopring, qtum, and santiment.
some are in further talks w/ financing soon-to-be announced consortiums.
only altcoins I can see someone serious investing are dash, monero, eth, maybe neothose shitcoins biz shills tho
Can confirm.
I work for a Rothschild owned family firm and they have bought HUGE amounts to promising altcoins.
The cycle continues.
The best time to become rich is upon us.
