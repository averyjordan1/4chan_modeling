Okay everyone's distracted by this fomo bch rally and a lot of retards are dumping alts to chase the pump and a lot of alts seem to be bottoming out nicely due to thisWhat alts are you buying anon and do you have any recommendations?

But India already has a coin
Tons of shitcoins will die horrible deaths but not every alt.
If you think OMG, XRP, NEM, LINK, ARK etc.
are just gonna go away you're obviously a faggot and have no business being in crypto in the first place.
If the established companies where the big money will end up fail, we all fail.
Shit I hold that I think will do well:NEO, XLM, RPX, UBIQ, MCOShit I don't hold that I think will do well:OMG, LSK, XRP I think at these prices, you'll make money in any good shitcoin.
who else buying up all the china coins in light of the chink takeover
i'm a noob who just bought XRP with 200$, is this bad?
Not if you're looking to hold long term.
Idiots, you're supposed to buy BEFORE the price goes down so you can get in before everyone else.
XVG man, how the fuck is this not more popular on here?Community is active, DEVs are pricks, but that's not uncommon.
Better than piece of shit Monero that's for sure.Just IMO but whatever
Other than LINK: MTH, CAG, MOD, NEO & WTC (chink takeover hedge).
