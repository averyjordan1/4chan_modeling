Why is this board just crypto talk
If there was a better way to make money, we would be talking about it
Because it's a crypto board and crypto is the most profitable biz rn.
Its the new wave, kiddo.
The biggest redistribution of wealth in our lifetimes.
Gee maybe because it's FREE MONEY!!

Why do people complain about /biz/ being /crypto/?
It was a shithole before, no one made money and most threads were either wagecucks complaining about their employment, or future wagecucks asking about which wagecuck career is better
Cryptoboard
because fuck the forex market.

It's moneymaking that doesn't require us the leave the computer.It also makes it really easy to LARP and pretend we're better than normies.
He actually believes this.
it already happenedretards from /g/ who left their shitty $200 used thinkpads on overnight and then kept the proceeds are easily worth millionsa single block which was easy back in 2010 is worth 400k todayat least one person posted proof of his lambo purchasetl;dr it already happened fuck off normie
because the cat's nose looks like ethereum's logo LMAO
this board was created as a containment board to prevent crypto from taking over /g/
This board wasn't always crypto talk, but before crypto this board was just boring and repetitive.
I've been here since it began in 2014 (When there were like 80 of us and we played that shitty stock exchange simulation game on marketwatch) and it just ended up being the same threads every day, a few stock threads, "rate my resume", entrepreneurship bullshit, social media marketing and drop shipping.
That's literally all the board was.
Then all the Ethereum shills came along and flooded the board with threads back when ETH was like $5 and made a bunch of us rich as fuck, and ever since then /biz/ has been /crypto/
You might be better suited to this forum --> https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/
I got into crypto in june, was looking for info about shitthen i remembered i was on /b/ like 2010-2011, there must be a board about internetmoney on there too,thanks for that, now i'm hooked on /biz/ even if i don't daytrade anymore.
you guys have the info first; don't know how you do it but you guys got it
/biz/ gets the info first because there’s no moderation and no upvote/downvote stuff, when something big happens you find out instantly because you refresh the front page and there’s 6 threads about it, as opposed to a place like Reddit where big news takes 30 minutes to hit the front page because of the upvote/downvote system
millionsFucko you think the big money isn't already involved?
The whole reason for the BTC surge is the Chinese billionaires waking up that they can use it to flood money out of the country.
They don't give a fuck about some fatass hacker being able to buy a lambo when they owned hundreds of lambos before this and are now going to use it to get even richer.
who cares nigger faggot?
the original poster was talking about redistribution and that is trueneckbears, people who LITERALLY had nothing to look forward to but inevitable suicide after obsessing over waifus well into their 30's, are making moneygo fuck yourself
Good for you.
But don't go around thinking you're some big super-hackers who are going to be the next gods of the world.
that's what it was created for
This
Mom I posted it again!
Its just surreal, I saw the countless threads on ETH back in feb/march when it was around $14-20 and it really has gone to the moon.
People slave away in first world countries, 12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week for minimum wage.
Devote a year of their life for £11.5k, a year of hell.
Why didn't they invest?
Why didn't they invest?But I did
Ethereum basically single-handedly made a lot of people on here at least 6-digit-rich and turned this board from /biz/ into /crypto/ in a matter of months
I bought on may 9th for $80 a coin and exchanged on polo for SHITCOINS may 11th.
>May 16th ETH MOONS.
>Contemplated suicide >will never escape fiat slavery
4529205I was late and bought at $32.
Wish I'd put more than $1200 in, still up to $98k though.
I actually thought about maxing my credit cards on ETH back then, really wish I had, if I'd had a similar percentage gain in crypto with that much initial capital in now I'd be a millionaire at this point.
