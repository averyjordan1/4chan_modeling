What's to prevent people from buying in troughs and selling at peaks?
Most coins seem really predictable on small time scales.
Give it a try and see why.
Yeah have fun with that..
because sometimes the "trough" is a cliff and the "peak" is only the base.that's why buy high, sell low works so well.
I've only been in for a day; I would appreciate advice that doesn't involve me losing money.
