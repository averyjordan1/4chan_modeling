What's going on here ETP fags.
Spotted a C&H forming.
What's been going on?
Looks healthy, lots of good news coming from ETP (partnerships, developments) I also expect new listings this month, and the release of the beta wallet soon.
Great investment.
Theres nothing to see here and your analysis in incorrect.
Seems like someone accumulating...
Very strange indeed.
It just randomly started to pump out of nowhere.
I suspect Bitfinex and the whole USDT mess to be responsible.
Kek.
Probably idiots on bitfinex realising cashing out to tether is worthless and putting their money in a bitfinex coin most likely to pump.
what if someone buys big, immediately sells and causes chaos selling, buys at the lower price?
