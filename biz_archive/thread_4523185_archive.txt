I am thinking of going 50% REQ and 50% MOD with 100k.Am I fucking retarded?
Nobody knows.
Could be a millionaire in 12 months or A broke nigger.
No guts no glory faggot
I would go all in on MOD desu.
They are ahead of the game.
You'll make gains, but maybe not in BTC.
Atleast ycombinator fleshed out REQ so you can rest assured it isn't a confido.
Also it can't go much lower
I am 80% REQ and 20% MOD.
Am I fucking retarded?Kinda but there are worse choices to not-diversity in.MOD seems like a super low risk choice and Req seems like a mild risk super high reward choice.You'll probably end up 10x on average within 6 months from these, worst realistic case 4X.
0X if jupiter crosses venus in mars' snatch during a solar maximum.
Am I fucking retarded?no, you are just average, everyone else is dumb and greedy too so they buy shitcoins not realising they'll hold bags for years or fomo and sell at a loss.
