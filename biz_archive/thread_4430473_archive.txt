All the hype and FUD of Link reminds me of Ethereum in 2016.
You people dont know how high this can go, so you're probably going to sell at the first milestone of $1 or $10 to move into some shitcoin or something.
I will tell you the truth, never sell.
CL will still be around five yrs from now and growing, expanding.
Crypto has not even got mainstream yet.
I know you cant see beyond the present but you'll see.
Nigga were gonna make it.
$300 per LINK in 3 years.FUD ME SENPAI.
You can't shake these Mythril Hands.
