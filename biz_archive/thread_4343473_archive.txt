I told you BCH is going back up in 5 hours at about 4 hours ago.
I didn't call the crash because I didn't know bithumb was going to crash.Anyways expect it to past .29 today because of the hashrate upgrade.but expect multiple multiple resistance because of people worried it might crash againkeep in mind bitcoin classic developers have stated they expect bch to take over in 6 monthsminers plan on doing it sooner than that.
bithumb market is going batshit crazy again.chinese miners flooding bithumb.
but for sure expect fucking major resistance at .30
Thank you for continuing these updates.
Your predictions have been pretty accurate so far.
What's your suggestion Great King?
May we never doubt you again.
i really don't know how far this is going to go.
Get your profit when the dust settles find a new train.or it might actually flip and bch might approach .75 .8 btcno problem
we're already seeing the first round of resistance at .23 stabilizing at .22about to shoot up or... if the upgrade isn't as profitable or whatever unexpected turn of eventit'll probably bleed off
