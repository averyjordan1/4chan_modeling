What do you think about Substratum.Pretty nice idea and still quite low cap (around $30 mil).
They have had sucessful private beta tests and I hear they have a public beta soon.They are pretty good at marketing/social media and give updates pretty often.
Been holding since ~$0.12.
It's been steadily gaining over the past few weeks.
We'll see what happens come December, but it seems like this could be a worthwhile investment
People don't relize its value, should be at least 50 million marketcap with their beta out.
