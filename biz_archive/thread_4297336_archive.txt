SC will be 0.00000100 to 0.00000150+ by December 15-20, you heard it from me first.
And also last
You will jump into the boat, you'll see.
Based on?
Sia broke my heart, oy vey it was like another digibyte
If you still have SC, hold it.
I cannot say the reason SC will reach 0.00000100, otherwise they'll find me.
That's bullshit but I wasn't going to sell anyway
Tfw I bought at 850
If you insist, solve the hash and you will get your answer.

Be fair to yourself at least, when sia was 850, bitcoin was what, 3k?
So sia at 200sats now would be worth the same as 600 sat on the day you bought it.
Not great, but not worth wojacking over
Yeah, but to get to 200 it would have to 3x and I would still be at a loss.
Not that I have a huge bag or anything, but I like to keep it as a reminder to cut my losses in time - things can keep dropping even if they're low.

Why do you have SYS shown?
I've only been told 0.00000100+ unsure about 400.
