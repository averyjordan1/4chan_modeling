Wall is gone, it might come and go but, take a look at the spread.If they place the 1000 BTC wall at 0,2, then 0,3 (it was at 0,1 few days ago) etc it means that they actually want to flip it OR they're acting of of the the biggest exit scam of the history.PS: Now is back at 0,2 that wall is fishy as fuck.
I have never seen a whale signal to other whales before
so it was down for like 5-10 seconds?
mightve just been a glitch.
>,get this euroshit out of here and use periods like a manly american faggot
>it means that they actually want to flip itare you retarded?
of course they want to flip it, this is not a pump and dump, they have invested too much money
They have invested too much moneyAnd they'll pull it right back out fucking every opitmistic newcomer that thinks it'll pump like last pump.
TA has shown this pump has far less momentum and all the volume is coming from Bithumb(Koreans).
They were responsible for xmrs pump weeks ago and bch and when they dump they dump HARD.
Don't get burned chasing Korean pumps, they end very violently.
They create fomo, force a buy price at 140% over real value, then whip away their wall Nd sell their bch for 0.2btc.They have been making bagholders this way for over three fucking weeks now, and still find a fresh supply of dupes every time.
This has been happening for so long that I do not feel any sympathy for those who lose money to these schemes.
You have to be literally mentally challenged to fall for this shit more than once
Being a bagholder is alpha.
Get shaken you cuck.
