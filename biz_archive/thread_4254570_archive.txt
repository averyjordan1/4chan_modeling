Hey /biz/I've avoided making this thread for a little while and just lurked when I've had some spare time but I'm interested in buying some crypt and joining you guys on the adventure to the moon.
The problem is I don't know how to start, do you guys use some sort of website or program to buy?
I'm new and really just looking at getting started the right way but I keep getting lost when trying to find the right information.
Can you point me in the right direction
if you actually lurked you'd know the answers to all these things
Google is your friend
sauce for the pic?
I've seen this one, was hot af seeing amazonian dominate the leprechaun
Its not difficult.
Plenty of noob friendly YouTube videos.
There are youtube videos on this do some research and stop trying to be spoonfed
I've tried google but all I seem to find is ads for coinbase app.
I don't think that's how many people trade on here.
Correct me if I'm wrong
I never even thought of trying YouTube.
At least I have that to go on.
Thanks
it's a shitty porn

Reddit cryptocurrencies can offer you way more material for newfags.
However know this: you need a wallet to store your crypto.
Try MyEtherWallet, Jaxx or MetaMask.
