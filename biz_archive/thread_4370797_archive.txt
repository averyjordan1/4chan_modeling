Hey anon programmer here, most people in the field are smart till it comes to politics if they have any respect for their co-workers and the projects they work on they won't bring politics into the workplace.
Sure everyone I work with I think are liberals but that doesn't matter really as we are working towards one common goal and deadline.
If you can't put aside your ego and try redpilling a bunch of antisocial programmers then your not really being project oriented and should consider another field.
Also people in coding bootcamps are usually not ever going to get anywheres other then web design pick a more focused field in programming and you'll realize that people are only focused on that topic and everything else is light gossip.
No, I'm a liberal /biz/poster who has to deal with whinefags like you making threads all day
