Why the FUCK is breadwallet telling me it will be $20 to transfer my bitcoin?
WTF is with bitcoin fees being so high?
Lowest I've had recently was $12.
I'm not a BCH cultist by any means but come the fuck on $20?!
Normies barely joining are going to be pissed at these bullshit fees.

Network is getting spammed by bcash fags
>$20>money???
I moved $90k for a $2 fee three days ago.Mempool is even smaller now, your client sucks.
Only reason I want to transfer to an exchange is in case those fags succeed in their operation dragonwhatthefuckever and I don't want it trapped on breadwallet
Lubosh explains it very well here.
He's a right wing theoretical physicist so you know his analysis is going to be spot on:https://motls.blogspot.com/2017/11/huge-fees-and-related-shocking-bitcoin.html
its your fault for not using Doge, or even Ethereum
We're not all neckbeard programmers who can use clients with shitty UIs that only autists can use.
The majority of us need something simple like Breadwallet and besides that I have heard nightmare scenarios of people having their funds stuck in limbo when they set custom fees.
Brainlet.
t.pseudo-intellectual faggot
Huh?
You insulted for pointing out that your client sucks.
If you can't adjust the fee, then don't cry about paying a premium.

Switch to a wallet that has the segwit update and let's you set the txfee.
Eg: greenaddress.it, electrum
