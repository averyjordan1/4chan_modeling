So how does this prove Obsidian is a scam and not this new thing that just copied Obsidian?
It doesn't, this is just a low effort troll.
eChat can't even proofread the English on their website.
The team has 4 employees listed on linkedIn and none of them are devs so I don't even know where they bought this shit
