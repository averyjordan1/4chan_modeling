SO CLOSE TO ICO PRICE COME ONNNNN
it WAS even closer to ICO before all this bitcoin shit happened AGAINI FUCKING HATE BITCOIN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH LET MY ALTS GO UP IN PEACE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
why do you own a shitcoin like this?
bagholding from ICO
Honestly, if this BTC/BCH continues until the point that public trust in BTC is weakened, visible alternatives will get a huge bump, and credible ETH-based trading platforms will similarly reap benefits.I see AST as a good long-term hold.
