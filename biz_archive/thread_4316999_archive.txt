Will this go over 0.4 in round 3 ?
Probably, looks kinda good.
I bought at .3
corecucks will post so many pink wojaks and then exit the market forever, lmao
But people post the pink wojaks when they buy ATH bags such as BCC.
0.3 isn't holding.Looks like we will hit 0.2 again soon.There can't possibly be more buyers available and the big sellers are already done.Soon mass panic will ensue.
