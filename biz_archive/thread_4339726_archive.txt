Do you do a crypto gainsHello, pajeet.Really wish this board had flags
F*** I was voice typing.What do you do with your crypto gainsÂ¿
blow it all on pointless shit like this
When do you reinvest and when do you spend?
I'm by no means a whale or very succesful in crypto trading, but I would withdraw 33% of your profits to keep for yourself, reinvest the rest.Don't blow money on pointless things, buy like a good mattress, so your quality of sleep increases and you'll become more productive.I think that's a nice item to blow your money on.
I reinvest if the gains are less than double my investment, and if the gains are more, I pull some money out to buy something to celebrate
Same with office chairs
