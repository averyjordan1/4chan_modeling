So what are the chances /r/btc is just run by a troll factory.
I mean post anything bashing /r/bitcoin and youll get tipped...I mean yeah /r/bitcoin is cancer as well with all the cencorship but btc just seems a little out of touch.
How does it feel to know that you're actually the only person in crypto?
I agree that r/bitcoin is quite shit.But r/btc is a cesspool of conspiracy theorists.
They are obsessed with their bullshit ideas and convinced they are the only ones who see the bigger picture.
Laughable really
Really sucks how they devide the community for their own gain

they devide the community for their own gainby getting banned from /r/bitcoin and creating a new sub to actually discuss bitcoin in?
