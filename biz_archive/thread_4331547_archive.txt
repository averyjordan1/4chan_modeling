How fucked am I?
The wallet doesn't even work properly.
Do you have literally no skills to install a wallet correctly?
Works for me.
If not leave crypto thx.
Love the half shill half fud.
Great buy, lots of potential.
We'll see some price movement once the BCH nonsense settles down.
ETP is the most promising project of 2018.
Huge things to come.
hey man ETP is straight up firePS: it doesn't always work but maybe you can find your birthdad on https://adoption.com/forums/23/birth-parents/It's usually for adopted kids but since he doesn't want to pay overdue child support he might leave a post on here that allows you to find him >>> your mom.
When you find him, ask him to teach you stuff.
He made money when he got a 2nd wife.
Maybe you even have a half brother that is 5 years younger that could install the ETP wallet for you?
He can tell his friends about it during lunch on Monday.
