Getting a weekly manicure is the best investment you can make
my husband told me to buy investments and save money>I told him manicures are investments>If I call it women's logic it's not illogical
yeah I've been considering it actually, I have naturally soft hands (22y/o male Ausfag) but at the same time, I work full time as a kitchenhand/dishy, so my nails break regularly and my hands are burnt/cut multiple times a day.
do you think it's still a sound idea?
