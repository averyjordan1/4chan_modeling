Do any Australians here have any experience with CoinJar and EFTPOS?
Is it still a thing?
Does it work everywhere?
As I understand it, you can directly spend BTC at an EFTPOS machine without having to cash out from an exchange first?
i think its from the cash account, never actually tried it
Yeah it works but donâ€™t buy bitcoin from them ( or anywhere atm because drama) they charge $100-150aud more than its worth, buy from an exchange or Coinbase/spot.
Read until your eyes bleed for a few weeks before throwing ya dollars at anything anon cryptoland is Fuken off tap.
Coinspot charge like $400 more than it's worth lul
To withdraw without fees you can do livingroomofsatoshi.com for aussies only
Hey cunt,I have a Coinjar card, as far as I'm aware it works anywhere for EFTPOS.To spend your bitcoin, you load it from your Coinjar bitcoin account onto a Swipe account which converts it to AUD.
So it's not really spending BTC "directly".Anyway, buy on Coinbase (it's cheaper) and then send to Coinjar for EFTPOS and cashing it out.
