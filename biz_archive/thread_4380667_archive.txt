Hey /biz/ created a noob friendly thread yesterday and the responses were pretty good, started to gather all sorts of information and guides on people trying to get into trading crypto.
Whoever has any questions that aren't solved by a simple google search feel free to ask and hopefully some anons will help.
The following google doc link is a database of links to guides that will help anyone get started with trading.
Guide Database: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xw1P1lH5xMzWR7mtz8EX3Sf5b7UcXOGShwWhbcstNl0/edit?usp=sharingAttention: - The above google doc is a WIP and will be updated depending on how much information I gather from each thread;- This thread IS NOT for speculation on whether to buy/sell coins, keep that to other threads, this thread is meant for newcomers so they get an idea of what cryptocurrency is and how to trade it.
