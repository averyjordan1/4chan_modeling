Lisk is going to announce a rebranding and some stuff in germany TODAYATH comming boys
Sweet.
Got about $50 on this already gonna be rich.
My guess is that rebranding won't happen in 2017 meaning it will get dumped to high $7.
Just my guess
Bought for about 2 dollars.
I will hold for a bit I think.
I’m still up decently, though if I’d bought and sold over the last week I could have maybe doubled the pissy little stack I had
They promised rebranding in july then september then october.They just promise and when the time comes they just keep quiet.I'll see how the conference goes today but my guess is they will just talk the same shit they always do, then say that rebranding will start in Q1 2018 without any specific and that Lisk will be listed on several korean excanges (those that already anounced it on their own accord)Then the price will drop to 7.50$ and will fluctuate there for months.Dont get me wrong Im holding 600+ Lisk since 2.70$ This is one coin that topple ethereum with its compicated, unsafe and buggy enviroment.
If the lisk team will provide and no more empty promises lisk can be huge.
Can doesnt equal will tho
Just added to Binance, I think it’s going new ATH in the next 5 hours.
