It's not over dude.
They did the same early times it hit 1k.
They sold a sizeable amount between 950 and 1k, then they rebought at below 900 until supply dwindled, then they push up through 1k again with buys.They are playing a patterned pump with mini pump and dumps along the way that raises more capital for a longer total pump and more gains.
Fuck man you had this posted literally 5 mins before a good %15-%20 pump.
Good eye man!
Your FUD is pathetic.
BTC is falling while BCC is stable.
