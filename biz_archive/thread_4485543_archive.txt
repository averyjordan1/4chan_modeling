One of the few coins out there that isn't a complete scam - it basically shills itself.
Definitely a worthy addition to one's portfolio.https://www.moneymorning.com.au/20171121/australian-crypto-power-ledger-price-509-month-alone.html
Even after the whole pbc dilemma it's still up 50% from and few days ago
this should be the coin /biz/ shills about instead of LINK.
Has already accomplished more already than linkies ever will
PBC dilemma?
Explain please?
Did it get picked?
noit was a natural moon

I'm taking a beating from this but I think it has so much potential.
Where do you see it on NEw years eve , OP

the coin that shills itself.
Co-founder and director of POWR asked to help run Tap Oil company.

I'm not hating on anyone staying in this long-term, but why not sell highs and buy lows to build your investment strength?
This has a long way to go, and you can probably 10x your stack of it before your final sell.
O I agree with you.
It's just that I'll use other coins for that.
BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.
My reasoning is that POWR could moon in a heartbeat, so I'm going to long hodl it and not touch.
It's all a gamble, but this one has so much potential and I ain't touching it.
Sitting comfy right now if iron hands.
Too much potential desu, but i bought in low af so it would really have to crash for me to take any sort of loss
