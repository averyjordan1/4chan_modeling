Yes anon, but wait a couple of hours before the fork.
If the miners are fucking around it will speed up a lot anyway which is like them holding the door open for you to do that.The downside / upside of the risk is in your favour if bch fucks BTC in the short term.I’m 5050 on what the miners will do.
I’m half expecting them to just let the difficulty drop a little bit.Don’t forget bitfinex can pump btc though, so we might be ok.
BUY BCH
wait a couple of hours before the forkDo you think it will take a long to send BTC to ETH?
Then just buy it back once the price of BTC is down.
I dont even know why I'm holding BCH maybe just for insurance.
I'm looking at Monero and HST, should I buy then with ETH or just wait it out?
Seems like when BTC dips, alts dip too
was thinking of selling bch for hst or monero
