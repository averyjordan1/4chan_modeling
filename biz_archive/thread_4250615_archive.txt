IT BEGINS!!!
GET FUCKED DINOSAURS!
B-bu-but people arent buying in for free coins.
Th-the uncertainty of Seg2x is gone, people will be buying more BTC.
Kek!
Deluded bitcoin maximalists.
The only reason this shit pumped is because of a free ALTCOIN HAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
NO BRAKES NEXT STOP HELL
ETH and LTC mooningAlts are backNo reason to hold BTC
>muh dead cat
Does anyone think they did it on purpose?
It felt like the pump started a month too early for the 2x fork and everyone was caught off guard.
Now they cancel a week prior to the fork when everyone expected it to pump extra hard
they tried to stop their shitcoin from tankingit'll tank anyways!!
It's entirely plausible.
You can't understate the level of shenanigans people are capable of
you tried, BTC
Bro the Illuminati probably threatened the fork idiots to crash this piece of shit coin and recover alts.
These greedy bastards were probably literally at guns point by the big boys who told them >cancel the forkGet fucking rekt btc cucks!
We did it, reddit!
Many people planned to sell BTC around the fork and go back into alts.
Now the FOMO started and everyone tries to get back as fast as possible.
It's fucking crashing!
