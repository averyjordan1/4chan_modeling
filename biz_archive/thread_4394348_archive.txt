>mfw the price needs to double before I can offload this shit
Linkies BTFO
linkies will say it dosnt matter, but they all bought that shitcoin hoping for a swift partnership and all they got was a sergey partnering with mcdonalds
but muh smartcontracts muh oracles
> ripple isn't a competitor to chainlink> chainlink is the first smart contract/oracle/dog shit in the worldDELUDED LINKIES
but muh decentralization
Remember you cant win if you buy link
deluded linkiesRetarded.
XRP and LINK are not the same thing, do not do the same thing, are not competitors, and will never be competitors.
XRP is a distributed ledger blockchain for transferring monetary value, and LINK is a middleware oracle that facilitates communication between smart contracts and external data.
LINK and XRP are NOT competitors.>But Ripple vs. SwiftDon't be so simple.
Swift won't go anywhere, and with partnerships, neither will Ripple.
If anything, we will most likely see a Ripple/Swift partnership, or even Swift buying out Ripple and incorporating its technology into their system.
>muh LINKXRP and LINK can coexist in the same system because THEY DON'T DO THE SAME THING.
Fuck you kids are dumb.
If you don't hold both then you need to just shut the fuck up and admit you have no idea what you're doing.
in b4 sergey abandons link like he did his last project
>implying LINK was ever a competitorstop giving vaildation to these retards and their toiletcoin.
LINK is a good token though.
It doesn't do the same thing as XRP and can even coexist with Ripple.
Cant stop laughing hahaha
