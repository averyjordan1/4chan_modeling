Burned by the muh institutional money meme.Bitcoin Core people said, fork is risk, after it all funds and banks are waiting to pump BTC to 10k.Me, see news s2x cancelled.
Scramble to buy, market order, at 7800USD.Fuck me right?
What to do?
The gooks are going to take all our money.
Its all run by scammy gook cunts.
git gud
Buy BCH.
Notice it stopped at 1200.
It would be freefalling if ((they)) weren't accumulating.
Once the new difficulty adjustment algorithm kicks in on BCH, they will change over again and 90% of hash power will be on BCH again.The flippening is still on.
Roger ver and several others still haven't dumped the majority of their BTC, and panic will spread about BTC when the network stalls again.
You're a complete idiot.
Rule number one is to never buy at all time high.
You deserve to be a bagholder.
But you'll probably still be lucky, since it's Bitcoin you bought.
You'll baghold for a few weeks at most.If you have some spare money to trade with, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV1EWBp0I6M
Don't trust forks.
Now you should scrable to buy bitcoin cash before bitcoin drops to 5k today and before the rest of the bitcoin corekek heard gets fomo and trys to buy bch at all time highs again.
Fuck that same noise.Went all in on BCH as it started pumping instead if BTC , doing good so far.
Fuck that same noise.What did he mean by this?However, playing BCH makes less sense.
