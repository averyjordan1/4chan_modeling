It looks like a good move or is that just me?
Just you.
If Bitcoin Cash brings a bear market alts will do worse than Bitcoin.
Last Bear Market BTC dropped $1200 to $200 and LTC dropped $50 to $1.50.
Also this chart is kind of retarded.
Proof-of-Stake is more secure than Proof-of-Work because you need 51% ownership of coins to perform a 51% attack, POW only beats POS in forming consensus immediately due to mining losses of mining on the wrong chain.
The immutability issues outside currency use for privacy coins needs explained.
Finally LTC DGB VTC and DOGE offer nothing unique in the space so long-term they are most likely some of the least likely to succeed.
You can't succeed without offering something new.
Yes many alts do offer unique things to the crypto space, but not any of the ones you mention here.
why the fuck would a bear market that big happen?
k sorry anon im a newbie
