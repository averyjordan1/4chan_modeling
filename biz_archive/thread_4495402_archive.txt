Got justed for being a tard and not jumping out various times now.
so I decide to cash out and pay off my credit card with my portfolio and start fresh next check I get.
well life sucks now all the excitement has been sucked out of me.
I need back in... What will I do if this market ever pops??
even if for fucks and giggles lets say I make it then what??
where will the excitement and passion be?>TFW life is meaningless without crypto trading.
Its honestly a great hobby.
The problem arises when you want to trade for fun but its not a good time.
