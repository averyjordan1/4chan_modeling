>"muh, I hope Bitcoin dies so I can finally have my alt season"
Your wish shall be granted
JUST
Nothing personnel kid, but it's time for alt season
alt season is here kid ask mom for more lunch money
alt season is here>literally a sea of red, even worse than when the BTC bullrunhell has seasons?
now bitcoin and alts are dying, but atleast we had a nice pump yesterday
it's pink wojak season for everyone

Alts go up mainly when bitcoin is stable, cause you need to have bitcoin to buy alts, and noone likes buying bitcoin when the price makes retarded loops.
2 months of suffering for 2 days of alt season and now it's suffering again.I don't understand that ETH is going down too though with all the ETH trading pairs it should hold some value.On the other side you can't trade shit with bitcoin cash
all these fucking forks man - just shoulda left old grandad BTC to trudge along while we make gains.
fuckers got greedy
KEEP FUCKING CRASHINGI GOT $20K USD READY TO BUY
The crash is over r-right?
