Hey man we're both in a way miners.Just you do stuff with actual rocks and I torture my gpu's by making them guess hashes.
Hey man
What was the upfront cost?
Profits will decline over time, without spending on upgrades right?
Bad decisions are why i'm not making 100k+.
I graduate this spring so I don't even have a real job yet but will be making 70k starting.
Regardless maybe you are right and only the top 15% are here posting their l33t salaries.
I somehow highly doubt it but maybe.
Without spending on upgrades profit will likely decline over time, as difficulty rises.
If less people mine difficulty could go down though (unlikely) and most of the time with higher difficulty comes higher price or the other way round.
Upfront cost for me was about 120k, but wouldn't recommend starting now as payback perioud is like 8 months.
Unless you live in NYC/SF, have a family business, or are getting a graduate degree.
you won't be making six figures immediately out of school/

property management with a portfolio of 100 properties>collect 10% of rents every month>salary at $160k/year
 Do you ever purchase your own rental property?
I've thought about investing but all the properties I manage are owned by two people.
Super simple arrangement, easy accounting, everyone pays their rent on time via e-pay.
I don't think I would be doing that much better as an owner, just more stressed.
All my extra income goes into BTC, XLM and ETH.
honestly its been kind of shit lately, started with a solid 2 average sharpe and manageable drawdown, which now dropped to 1.2 sharpe and the drawdown is steadily moving in an upward direction...
This is momentum trading a rather complex linear state-space model.
Considering I spend a good amount of time coming up with new shit for the model (mainly working on better regime switch detection) its kind of not worth it really.
Considering just ditching fx for now and focusing on etfs and crypto.

My business doesn't make profits, because my business has (untaxed) royalties to pay to the business of a friend.
As my business can't afford to pay me a salary I don't have to.My friend has another business that rents some private real estate of mine to use as an office.
Renting out real estate as a natural person is also untaxed here (besides what I have to pay in taxes for owning real estate).So basically I earn a living renting out real estate while my job is more of an experiment, which actually only brings in money for my friends business.Where I live this pretty much ensures you have to pay virtually nothing.It's pretty simple really.
Where I live two daughter companies of the same holding can also transfer profits between each other without paying taxes.
Not sure if this is possible in the USA.
