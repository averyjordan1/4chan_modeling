The team bans users from the slack left and right.
Most recent ban was from someone asking a question to blackstone.
Ah idiot blackstone, what's new...

the same shit happened to the funfair telegram, anon.
welcome to the club
633 odn from ICO here.
Got banned for asking "WHEN WILL THIS SHIT NUGGET MOON?"
Don't really give a fuck but fuck you odn.
Fuckin ODN man.
Wish I had sold shortly after it hit 90 cents on cryptopia.
Quit their slack because of all the cancer
Genuine shit NUGGET of a coin
Agreed and check'd
am i the only one that thinks this will moon?
Not soon but eventually once the team gets their heads out of their asses.
Eventually, but they need those Tamico guys to tell them to shut the fuck up.
I had hopes but judging from their blase and plain shitty conduct on slack, it's anyone's guess.
I blame blackstone for most of the pr troubles.
He isn't the most sensible person in the world...
Anyone got screenshots of the conversation from earlier that made Blackstone rageban people?
