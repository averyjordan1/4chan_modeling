Give me one good reason why they would allow this tether shit to continue by the time the Bitcoin Futures rolls out and institutional money starts joining.
They dont control Bitfinex, which makes it likely they will BTFO the whole market before the futures release.
Institutional money won't move I to anything unless they've got their little brother Government right there to back them up
Which is why i see Bitfinex getting wrecked and the entire crypto market tanking.
Who in their right mind would trade BTC futures when Bitfinex can pump BTC's price on a whim.
The tetherscam meme is literally retarded
Which is why the printed 60 million this morning?
there may be a dip if X bullshit happensthen fucking buy it, nobody cares.
This isn't proof of anything
phone postNobody takes you seriously nigger
>This isn't proof of anythingtry exchange your tethers for dollars, you fucking sheep.
Why would I want an inferior currency though
What is your point ?
>Why would I want an inferior currency though.Because this is the currency that is printed by bitfinex + sister company bitfinex to / as-placeholder for real dollars-to pump the price of bitcoin-to loan out fake dollars for real dollars with interests.-Pay off debt with fake dollars.Remember Bitfinex is not affiliated with any ban.. they can't borrow REAL DOLLARS.
Are you that stupid?
bitfinex and sister company are literally printing fake dollars to run their casino empire.First day in crypto?
This is 6 months old news.
