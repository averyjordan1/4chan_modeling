Do you guys think BTC will still reach a new ATH before the kill?
Inagine how much money those fools buying at these prices are going to lose in 14 hours or so..
Lmao its not going to happen
>supposed to be the day of operation dragonlarper>BTC is hitting new ATH, about to hit over 9k in KOREA evenIt's over Ver, just give it a rest
Delusional bcrashies
It's still 14h away and it's rising with very small volume.
This is just whales shaking BCH from weak hands.
I'm buying more BCH if it goes below 0.15
it happens after the btc retarget https://fork.lol/pow/retarget
 hours to go :)
It doesn't start before in 13 hours.Wtf is this board smoking.There was no reason whatsoever to believe the recent price rise was a flippening attempt.
It would have delayed the BTC difficulty adjustment for the BCH side.
It makes no sense if their plan is to cause chain death.
4535858Do you really think that it wouldn't be taking off long before that considering everybody has access to the knowledge of this plan?
If this is actually gonna happen there is no reason BTC should be hitting ATHs half a day before.
what are you, fucking 10 years old?
the market has made its move.
your turn, bch.
you still wanted to play, dont you?
too bad, sit the fuck back down youre playing.
this shit is for keeps son you should have looked at what you were signing up for.

are you scared motherfucker well good you better be scared cuz I am just getting started.
The real fun is just beginning youre going to stay and find out yourself just how far down you can go.
rock fucking bottom, faggot.
maybe then ill show you some mercy
Did they print new tethers again?
This is how the last BTC pumps have worked..
Korea was leading this latest pump up, Bitfinex is actually lagging behind at way lower prices so I doubt it was tethers this time.
