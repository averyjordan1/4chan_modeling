So what happened with operation dragonslayer?Just a shitty pump to 0.18 then back to the toilet where it belongs?
TRASH.
So much hype for nothing
operation dragonslayer isnt for 2 more days you toolthis is just pre-war accumulation
When should I buy
koreans are leading the charge on this and the price on bithumb is steadily going upthis might end up being a lot like last time where BCH goes up 20-30% a day for a few days and then 100% on dooms day
Not true.
Checked bithumb and they were buying at 0.16 while on bitrrex price was 017
aaaaaaahahahaha the level of delusiondo you even have a shred of rationale for what you're saying?
Pre-war accumulation?
Literal retardation.
Enjoy those BCH bags
ive been watching bithumb and bittrexbithumb price is 1490 while bittrex is 1470
You right nevermind
Should I constantly keep a tab open on bithumb to see where the price is going and get out before the pump is over?
First off I've made over 30k profit on BCH this month.
Not all of us are retards who buy once it already had a 100% run up in a day.
I have no bags.Second this is exactly what happened during the last flippening attempt.
There was huge volume from korea and price went up 20% each day for a few days right before.
Plz dump your bch bags.
I'm deluded cashie.
I need to accumulate more.
