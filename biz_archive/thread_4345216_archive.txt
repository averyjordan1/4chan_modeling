I'm so tired of those pussies playing it safe and watching the alt coin market bleed.
How can we make them start going all into our coins?
50,000 new users every single day on bittrex but nothing is growing.
It's completely absurd!
We should be seeing new all time highs every single day.
dont worry anon.
let them watch us.
they can watch us buy low and sell high.
Then they can continue watching us drive off into the sunset in our lambos
Once things get moving they'll buy.Normies don't notice a profitable coin unless it's already mooning.
Normie here, which coins do you sincerely believe in that you wish me to take a look at?
inb4 link shills.
Don't buy that shitcoin.Consider REQ, Ark, and OmiseGo
I don't sincerely believe in any coin long term other than bitcoi.
I believe in some coins short term value and so should you.
the market is saturated in useless shitcoins.
