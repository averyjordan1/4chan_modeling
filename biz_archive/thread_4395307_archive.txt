So, are we just going to hold our eyes and ears shut and hope this shit just goes away?
What meaning?
after all its just a token coupled to USD to make trading on exchanges easierofc its shitty but what we gonna do about it
it's not coupled, it is scam
The entire point of this controversey is that there is zero hard proof that it is "coupled" to the USD.As a matter of fact, there is plenty of evidence to suggest the opposite, that Tether is running a scam and has nowhere near enough USD in reserve to cover what they are issuing.
it's a USD "printed" by a private entity.
when the FED clamps down on tether, and it will, the shockwaves will bring down the current cryptobubble
