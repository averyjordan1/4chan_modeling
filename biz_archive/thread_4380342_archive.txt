Should I buy BTH again?
I hade some good money last weekend with it, im thinking if it drops to 0.11 or 0.16 to move everything to it.
Both seem to be good entry points, but im not sure if it will reach 0.11
and by BTH I mean BCH
It's not going to .11On the off chance it does, there's no point buying it because it means it's dead in the water.
chart clearly shows theres a good possibility it may.
Bitcoin is going to 0.11 not BCH
Should I buy BCHYes.
The answer is always yes.
BCH is the real bitcoin.
1 bitcoin is dropping to .11 bitcoin
If you want to be on the winning side, you most definitely should buy BCH
