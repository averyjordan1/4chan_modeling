Thanks for the shilling.
I've accumulated and sitting comfy.
The product will be launching soon, its still trading close to the ico price, a bit higher in fact.
This should be an easy 3-4x.
This is a good coin and does not need much shilling.
i see you too, pajeet.
they skipped on binance listing for some reason.so it must be bittrex.

It's a colloquial term from a well known shitting street in northern Mumbai that means, "watch your step".
