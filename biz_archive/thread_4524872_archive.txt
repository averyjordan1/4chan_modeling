Zen Protocol is the next great ICO, have fun with your link and powr shitcoin pajeets, I'm hodling until lambos.
Zencash is real.
This is bootleg
They're unrelated, and Zen Protocol is the older one of the two projects anyway,
he was still a pajeet
Pajeets chase shitty pumps, buy high and sell low.
I'm /comfy/ waiting for an ICO to moon.
>can't afford the presale>no lambosWhy live
Whats the presale cost?
BTC minimum, I'm a poorfag with 0.6 :(
oh lol so I guess I just need to throw in 3% of my portoflio to get in I guess.
F* is cool
Damn that's a big portfolio, teach me your ways
What's the difference between F* and OCaml?
