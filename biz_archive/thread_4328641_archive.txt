Deluded bitcoin maximalists who believe in the store of value meme, how exactly can Bitcoin be a store of value when the possibility of BCash taking over literally is enough for the value to plummet hard?
Who the fuck would want to use it as a store of value then without any other useful utility backing it up?
You cant even look at BTC for aesthetics kek.

You fags keep using the store of value meme as the reason why Bitcoin should win over altcoins like ETH.Whether or not Bcash plummets with BTC is not the point.
If something can plummet because of something taking over its "brand" then its not a good store of value.
Unlike when its value is based on its actual utility.
