Hey there biz.
I want to start a thread on the ICO Aphelion.
It's general sale just started yesterday and may or may not be sold out yet.
It's launching on the NEO platform.I was verified into the Pre-Sale and was pretty shocked at how steep the discount is for Pre-Sale participatns.
100%.
Yep.
100% bonus of APH tokens.
So if you participated or are looking to buy right after release of tokens I would watch out for a massive dump.I'm not here to stir FUD, I'm just a ICO prospector and this was a huge red flag for me and my people.
biz also experienced a high amount of JUSTing these last weeks so I went ahead and dropped a bone for you all in case you didn't know.
"The private offer has a $5,000 USD equivalent minimum and includes 100% bonus tokens, reducing your token cost to $0.10 USD equivalent.
The standard sale without bonus will be sold at $0.20 USD equivalent.
"Have a good day biz-
bump friends
thank You kind anon
bump bump bump
Of course anon- we need to spread awareness so we all are able to make it rather than shitpost (although it's tons of fun).
Check Neo reddit, this ICO is a scam.
Fuck you shillers
