bitcoin still has shit optimization.long transfer times and high fees make it a shit currency.I know you tards are in it for the profit but it literally can't become a currency without dealing with these issues.
lot of people>key names>wanting s2xThis was a made up fork designed to pump Bitcoin price, when will you understand?
Sure, but Bitcoin still needs a pretty invasive overhaul.A bunch of people were thinking s2x was part of that.
