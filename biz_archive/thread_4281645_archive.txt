We keep telling you fags that BTC's price was inflated because of fork FOMO and you wouldnt listen.
>muh institutional money>fork money didnt pump it>CME group news is what caused the pump
I'm so fucking justed I cant believe I listened to fucking core shills.
Fuck.>bch is gonna dump nowThey said for fucking hours.
Btc dumps instead?
Fuck this stupid shitty core coin.
Stupid dinosaur.
FOMOX wasn't an airdrop it was literally all or nothing>being this retarded
hahaha whatever keep coping, people expected free coins.
whether or not they would actually be receiving it for "free" is irrelevant.
BTC will never be $7500 again.Screencap this you cuck.
>BTC is already going up againwho else /bought10minutesago/ here?
nothing goes down in the span of hours/days in a straight line buddy.
you're going to regret that decision once it hits 5k
Guys, really, do you think markets only go up?
Fuck I missed that news.
Unironically cashing out now.
See you guys at 5k
