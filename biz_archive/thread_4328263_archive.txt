1. corecucks keep spreading the meme "HODL" in order to push the price higher2.
core devs refuse to increase transaction throughput, so people can't cash out in such a panic event3.
corecucks have no choice but to keep hodling because they will need to pay an unaffordable high fee to cash outAt the end core devs don't care about their defenders (saying "there is nothing urgent here") because they have been multi-millionaires since years ago.
It was a Ponzi scheme the moment it was being traded in the market.
holding pushes the price higherNo>people can't bank runA good thing desu>feesLike $5, so unaffordable

i got fucked this way during the first leg up for bcc when the hashing power suddenly switched overseeing this post just tells me you don't actually use bitcoin.
it's shit, no one who actually uses bitcoin wants to pay such high transaction fees when they can use bitcoin cash and pay smaller fees so enjoy getting burned by your ponzi morons
it's more accurately described as a ponzi cult
