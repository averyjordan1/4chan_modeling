So how fair was techcrunch to your crypto of choice?
I'm pretty happy.
I feel like normies are going to buy my coins after reading this.
>https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/100-cryptocurrencies-described-in-4-words-or-less/I especially like that they called BCash a "Bitcoin Clone" and LTC a "Faster Bitcoin".
So fucking sweet.
Did you see the part where they mentioned ChanCoin?
Said its the most bestest coin!
For anyone looking for Chainlink (LINK), it's here:"External data for contracts".
Thoughts fellow LINKmarines?
what would you say in four words?I liked their description of BAT though.
I feel like normies will see "decentralized ad network" and will write that one down for further research.
Pretty much spot on.
Except its incentivcized and decentralized.
Chinese Ethereum plus identity.
Interesting.
they fucking listed TRONim gonna be RICH BITCH
They forgot PayPal 2.0.
thank you for listing all the overpriced shitcoins that should be avoided.
BCH should be changed to Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash, it's not a "Clone" of Bitcoin, it is the original Bitcoin without segwit, lightning networks, censorship, or the fee market.
My shitcoins arent even in top 100 yet
>privacy dogecoin
>ETC - Ethereum cloneJesus, what assholes
"External data for contracts".
Thoughts fellow LINKmarines?Yeah there is is a mistake in descriptionIt should say "Mass suicide cult"
Funny considering ETH is a shitty knockoff that goes back in time anything bad happens.
going against the law of code.t.
