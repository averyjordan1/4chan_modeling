He's a complete spastic.There is no word for the people who pay him money.
he recommended a coin that did a 20x, hence I am interested.

He likes SALT and REQ
He also said that bitcoin would reach an ATH of $6888 in february next year and at that exact price would retrace 40%.You fling enough shit at the wall and some eventually sticks.
I know, I am going to take everything he says with caution but I just want to see for myself if he is completely nuts.
He manages to do a lot of CEO interviews, so he must be right sometimes.
well you should update ur reports as time continues to move lol
he is master shill.
buy the icoÂ´and low cap tokens he mentions.
He's an interesting person that I would never seriously listen to for financial advice.
associates himself with scammers and constantly recommends shitty scammy icos/crypto.
the only time he's right with predictions is for low market cap crypto that he can actually influence
4268978He recommended populous, which is pretty big now.What do you think of it?
checkeddunno.
i think of him as a pumper, buy it right at the moment he talks about it and sell when it moons.
is he a good coder by the way?
I hear people say he analysis the code on github of some projects.
