Hello, What do you think about flags on /biz/ like on /int/?
Would you be in favour or against it?
How do you think it would help or harm the board?I for one, would love to filter out all of the pajeets shilling their shitcoins for 0,01 $ per post.
I think flags would make /biz/ more trustworthy.
You want low intellect video game playing poltards invading here?
Good for you.
Not for us
