4524113It's not related to Link, ISO 20022 is a key feature of Swift, lots of shit Swift does is going to be connected to that.

See 
4524393Hate to burst your bubble but  is right.
This is not related to LINK.
Oh shit, I know which hotel they're going to be...I worked there for a while.
Might take a look if security isn't too tight.
There's a big difference between being solely related to LINK and the possibility of including their work in the session though.
Presumably they are part of the "global SWIFT community" and we know they're working of ISO20022 implementations.
Here's an actual post-Sibos statement by Swift regarding Chainlink:
It's about SWIFTSmart Oracle...which Chainlink is working with SWIFT to implement.
Thats the news EOY.
You guys do realize this is priced in right?
Your mother is priced in
