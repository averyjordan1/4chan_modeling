Tell me how the fuck marketcap is still only 10 million?
Because the team let it sink to 80% below ICO without any communication or life support.
Makes no sense.
CEO is in Forbes.Company made revenue!
99.9% of ICO never made a cent.
The project is highly valuable and useful.Will be 100m in no time once word gets out.
exactly this.
No exchange aside from (s)HitBtc, thus very low volume, even though they've made a big deal about validating everyone to ensure maximum compatibility with as many exchanges as possible (LOL) - which led to multiple delays of the ICO, which in turn contributed to people losing their faith in them.Also 0 marketing (from what I could see).
Note: I'm a bagholder on this crap, so I really hope it takes off at some point (at least so I can break even), but it might take a long time (even tho it seems to be climbing these past few days).
Fingers crossed!/rant over.
Well this shitcoin is worth far more than any other shitcoin at current cap should go above ico soon
