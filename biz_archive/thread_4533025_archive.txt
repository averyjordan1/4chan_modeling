Zcoin or ZenCash?
Help me /biz
quite the optical illusion you got there
One is a shitcoin that has nothing going for it besides a pumpndump palm beach niggerThe other is ZCoin
Zcoin is one of their buys too.
If I was a man worth 7 billion and want to launder and tax evade, sure thing is zencash.
Nice try shill.
Only sure thing is Monero.
Next best thing is ZCash but fuck that.
ZCoin is third best and has the market cap with most room for upside.
One node nets you 1.3k per month.
Its nuts.
