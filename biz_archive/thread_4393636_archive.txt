>Walton and H2O now on COSSfeels fucking fantastic that I'm a coss whale and accumulate all this shit for free
volume?
ONE.
QUADRILLION.
DOLLARS.
I have done some research.
COSS is literally the best investment,
i really hope so.
My bags are so heavy i'd rather sink than to try to drop them
I'm not memeing when I say this-- Stop promoting COSS and accumulate.
It's currently set to go back down to ~0.00004500 eth or lower.
And it won't actually moon until one of these things happen: the 'pro' UI is released, fiat trading is added, exclusive high-interest ICO gets listed.Hold the hype until it's time, as you're going to just hurt accumulators.
down to ~0.00004500Deluded fudder, you realize this would bring down the market cap to ~$1.5 million?
I ain't selling you my bags.
WE ARE THE COSS-PLAYERS AND WE ARE NOT SELLING
Never told you to selll.
I'm a holder that is slowly accumulating because this coin is under the radar and will 30x within months.
I'm just being practical about it not mooning until there's something meaty.

Started with 2k now sitting at 5.4k.>I'm just being practical about it not mooning until there's something meaty.No arguing.
It won't go much lower though, if at all.
you still accumulate ?i have over 300k COSS now and wait for the happening
Yeah, but I'm kinda broke so I'm doing small swing trades to up my stack 1% here and there.
I'm hoping to get to ~100k or so.300k is a lot.
When this moons, you're going to be loaded.
Though, when it moons the dividends will probably make it worth it not to sell.
Wen Moon?
If it ever goes that low I'll go fucking BALLS DEEP in COSS
