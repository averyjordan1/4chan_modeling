Someone ddosed the korean exchanges, that caused the crash.
Just like when ripple pumped.
Alot of mad people out there at ETC for some reason.
LOL
always been a losercoin, always willCryptoYoda used to shill this garbage and said it would be worth more than ETH.
DURR CODE IS LAWi dont expect a simpleton such as yourself to understand the importance of having an unwavering code that is set in stone like the US.
Constitution
IDK why this is like 1/10 of eth either.
While that may be more attractive from a philosophical point of view, you can't let your philosophies or politics cloud your investments.
Nobody develops on ETC.
It's a garbage coin with no tech behind it and no projects.
It has no value proposition anymoreI'm sure there are some shithole african countries with a better track record of strict constructionism when it comes to interpreting their constitution than the US and Europe, but I don't see you lining up to move to them over the first world.
Same thing
