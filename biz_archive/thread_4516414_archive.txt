What's up /biz/Poorfag here.Only had a 40 coins and I sold them all cause I saw it go into the 79 satWhat are some other coins I can buy?
Bumpo
not sure what the fuck you just said, but DOGE is doing its seasonal pump and will hit between 85 and 100 sats.
Hopefully more, but whatever.
These DOGE pumps are always easy money.
Just try to get in before it hits 25.Check the history of it to see its seasonal pumps if you are smart and like to look into random things people on 4chan say lol.goodluck, man.
hope you strike it rich.

yeah what the fuck did you even type
Only had a 40 coins
haha im a fucking idiot
got 10k myself, its all I have to trade with (0.05btc in cold)If it hit 100 sats I'd be mighty happy.
I'd just start trading doge every season and stop trading and get back to programming (autism bucks are taking me to uni for CS)plz moer tho thx DEURLpqTpjhTnprWtcakRMiFZTWtw86ShJ
