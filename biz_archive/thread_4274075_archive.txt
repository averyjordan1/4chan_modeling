Hey /biz/, do you like ARK?
It definitely gave me some hesitation early on and a lot of people think that ARK is overly ambitious, but when compared to earlier Crypto projects like Bitcoin and ETH, I think ARK's really come into their own, commercially and development-wise.
The whole project has a clear, sound direction and gives a new sheen of consummate professionalism to blockchain space that really gives the coin a big boost!
ARK's been compared to Lisk, since the lead dev has worked on both projects, but I think ARK has a far more solid development team.
In August, ARK released ACES, the first proof of concept for their smart bridge.
But I think their most important masterpiece will be push-button deployable chains and ArkVM.
A development release so hyped, most people probably don't understand the implication.
But they should, because it's not just about the ability to create SmartContracts on the chain.
It's also going to be the harbinger of the blockchain based Web 4.0.
Hey ChainLink!
Try solving the oracle problem now, you fuckin' shitty shitcoin.
dubs
The
SHITCOIN
I'll be honest.
When ARK hits $40.
I'm going to buy a Batman costume and hire two whores to dress up as Catwoman and Wonderwoman buy that Lambo from Dark Knight Rises and then maybe get checked for STDs at a Planned Parenthood
This is tempting
