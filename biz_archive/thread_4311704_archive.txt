why korea?
Chinese miners are using it to dump btc for bch since they can't in their own country
look at their ETC spending spreesomething fishy is going on... or koreans are just dumb
jihan is behind this.
get ready for the ultimate dump boyos, brace yourselves, for the age of pink wojacks is upon us
I think most bizbros are still in btc and shitcoins like eth/link.
Doubt this will effect many people apart from select few "special" cases.
