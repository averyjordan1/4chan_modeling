all this yammering on about exotic alts... is anyone else here just trading via the onramps?
i gave up on chasing alts back in june, took my profits and bailed.
a few weeks ago, i just focused on trading on gdax and gemini.
it's been slow and i just poke my positions during breaks at work but i'm up 28% on my beer money investment.
probably easy to do in a bull market...i made a good bit of money before i bailed on alts but i'm trying to decide if i want to keep at this slower style of trading.
i didn't have time to read all the news and keep up with the alts.
trading btc/eth/ltc/usd is a lot more manageable to follow so i might put real money back into it.
i only worry about one or all of them flat tanking and then i'd be jolly well fucked.if you're just trading the onramp exchanges or only a small number of pairs, how's it working out for you?
are there any serious disadvantages to this approach if i'm not looking to ride a moon mission?
