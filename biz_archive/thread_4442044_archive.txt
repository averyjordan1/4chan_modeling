what if cash out some money, I have to pay taxes to uncle sam or back in home county l. fellow aliens staying in usa but not usa citizen , can answer me how u dealing this crypto shit with taxman
to USA, not your home country unless you are from eritrea
but honestly, just dont pay any taxes on crypto and they wont care.
are u student?
if u are under 35k income then there is not tax.
non-citizen also have to pay?
so these all day/swing millions of entries with few grand gains have to report even we not cash out ?
for example, i brought 2 btc, moved them to alts, kept it for couple of years and cashed out.
so we have to report to taxman this yr that I inverted 10k in btc or just when cash out ?
4442115may not, if you not cash out do not worry.
probably no problem with cashout either unless you make a big spend in USA with it.
so if you dont cash out, do not report it.
Give it to USA, we need money for the wall.
