I bought some VTC today with money I was NOT supposed to spend.
Is my wife going to divorce me?
I have done no research at all, just fell for /biz/ memes.Am I going to make it or not?

Might as well tell her you were robbed
What coin would you have put $500 in?stop buying fake bitcoinWhat did he mean by this?
If your wife divorces you consider that a plus.
Marriage is a cuck's game.
Sell VTC and buy VIA.
When your wife sees the gains you've made it will be pic related
Nah, you're good.
Get comfy and hold for big gains.But srsly... how many times have you read so your own research and don't spend what you can't afford to lose???
Ah yes, the tried and true "use other people's copyrighted material to advertise your scam" approach.Brb, emailing Disney's tip line.
Don't worry it's one of the safest bets atm.
