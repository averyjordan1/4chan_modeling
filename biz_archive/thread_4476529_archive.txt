big lesson guys
;-;7
it takes courage to show this OP, hope you recover soon.
makes me sick.
Damn.
Glad I had nothing to do with that coin after my small increase.That's the exact type of team I would feel no sympathy for if someone found em and fucked em up in the back of a, alley or something.
i felt pretty bad after the teeka p&d, but thisshit right here, that's just messed up
you'll get back on your feet anon.
Most of us have been JUST'd by one coin or another
at 1 stage i was 2 x my investment but couldn't sell because i was not at home.
then i wake up in the morning to find it was a scam.
i only trade with money i can afford to lose.i guess i will just have to hold my other coins a bit longer to recover the lose.but a good lesson for everyone!
JOOST'D
Just 5 eth, it's not like it was 50 or 100
Meh, its only $1000 OP, you'll make it back later
Youre pathetic.
Everyone has different amounts of money, and people like u are the worst to deal with, it gets on my nerves.
5 ether for me would be high amount, for some it would be low and for some it would be all in.
Yall gotta understand that not everyones rich.
I can bet my bitbeans that you have no friends irl
only gamble with what you can afford to lose.
thats rule #1 idiot
Dude, if 5 ETH for you is a large amount of your portfolio you shouldn't be investing that much into a single brand new alt, only a fucking retard goes all in or dumps their whole portfolio into any coin that isn't fucking time tested and in the top 10
It's all relative.5eth can be 1% of his wealth and can still a lot to him.
