Let's all agree this is a shitcoin which many anons lost money on.
But it is lower each time I check it.
This cannot go on forever and at some point it will find support.
Any thoughts on when the next moon mission is?
It found support moron.
Third time its rebounding around 1030
I'll buy 10 when it hits $100 and ride the sad meme pumps
jesus kill yourself retarad.
you can't call something in the top 3 that's up 75% in the past 7 days a shitcoin lol stay poor idiot.
yeah people got justd who bought high and sold low but that's their stupid fault, has nothing to do with bch.
Tbh most support are from people who still believe there is a chance for it to overtake BTC.
Wait a couple more weeks and let their delusional dreams die before investing in it
I've been watching this coin all day.
Every time it looks like it's going up it then goes down.
Then everyone panic sells.
Sounds like the thing to do.
Bagholders keep trying to buy the dip yet it only goes lower.
