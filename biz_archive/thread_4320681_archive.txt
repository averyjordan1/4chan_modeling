5500$ when?
Soon tm
Cash just dropped below 1500 again, don't be mad my friend.
Try $4500.
is what I'm looking for tbqfhwy senpai
Enjoy the slow bleed, the whales are gone, they took their profits from 2900 and ran, now it's up to the poor peasants to suffer.
It already hit 5.5k last night
there is no reason to curse
It's going back to 5500 first then we will see it spike down to 4500 maybe for the briefesr moments.
Might be 4600 might be 4700.
Before bouncing back up.
Hope you have orders set
