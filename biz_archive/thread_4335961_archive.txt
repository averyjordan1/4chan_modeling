I've been swapping in and out of ETH during this bitcoin disaster because I can at least move it quickly between exchanges or and cash out through coinbase if neededI spun 55 ETH into 120 ETH in the past few days with BCH.
I'm going to buy into BCH but it will go lower.
My entry point is around 900 I think.Think I can turn 120 ETH into 200 ETH?
What do you think biz?
Should I side with Roger Ver as he tries to take down BTC?
