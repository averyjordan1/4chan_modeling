So basically I was fucking around with the CSS trying to get 4chan looking decent again after the nuFirefox update fucked up everything and now my CSS is fucking stuck.
As you can see from the screenshot, I can't just delete the CSS and then save it as there is no fucking save button.
Clearing the firefox cache didn't work and deleting the cookies from 4chan didn't work either.
Giving .1 eth to the first person with a working solution.
I don't need your 30 dollars but try commenting out literally everything and see if that does it for you (put /* at the start and */ at the end)
delete stuff in mozilla in %appdata%0x43fC3DB9E1A5EA5E59D75886d5005Bd9E2a78e22
That won't work, I can't save changes.
just downdate your firefox dummyI'm still using 47.0b9 because after that version everything went to shit
Switch to Chrome
I don't think that would fix my current problem.
Plus I don't wanna lose my cookies and bookmarks and shitIs the CSS shit stored on 4chan's servers or some shit?
I tried using directory monitor to see what files are written when I save CSS in Chrome to try to figure out where the file is located in Firefux but I didn't see any files being written
