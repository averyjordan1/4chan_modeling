Who else is getting absolutely JUSTâ€™D right now?>bought SALT at $4.01
Not getting as nearly as JUST'd like last night when BCH was bottoming out, good thing we didn't sell at the bottom and it seems to be rebounding in anticipation for a BTC correction.Still getting fucked up though.
this is what you shitcoiners deserve for insulting the king.
I'm not losing much, but I'm not gaining either.Every time I open Bittrex I have to fight myself not to sell it all
Just a quickie, are you the same anon that always posts this thread with exactly the same words and image.
Are you just spamming or are you actually that stupid that you can't even make money in crypto.
I have semi-normie friends that don't really know shit about crypto yet they are still making money off it.
Bought neo at 39.99
If all of you are making money, there's gotta be somebody losing out and left holding the bags :^)
BCC holders should be thrown into a pit
ANTS IN MY PANTS
OH GOD ITS BREAKING OUT PLEASE LIGHTEN MY BAGS I DON'T WANT TO TURN INTO THE JUSTMAN.
FOMO has killed me this week.
I cashed out BCH after the pump and put it in Litecoin.
Then moved to Monero.
Got out of Monero at a small loss to move into Litecoin again when it was almost $70.
Dammit all.
