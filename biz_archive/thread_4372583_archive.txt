Nice.
Can I buy $100 worth from you?
Happy to pay a 10% premium.
Im sure this should more than cover the <$0.05 transaction fee.
Congrats on this, seriously.
thanks Vitalik I really appreciate thatI'll give you $100 worth of bitcoin cash if you stick a sharpie up your ass and post a timestamped proof of work
Is that an admission that unless markets are tampered with then BTC is doomed to be slaughtered by BCH?What you don't appear to grasp is that it can only be delayed at any rate.
How the fuck should I know what actually happened?
claims shit happened>confronted with implications.>backs off.k
