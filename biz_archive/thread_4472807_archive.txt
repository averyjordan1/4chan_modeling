whatsup with bitfinex???
Withdrawing iota to binance taking 4 hours now, never happened before WTFFF
bitfinex about ot be goxxedjust you wait
i had the same problem taking out ETH last night
thats why im withdrawing my iota fuck
did you get it out???
My friend had no problems to withdraw ETH few hours ago, done within a minute.Now I am trying to withdraw my shit and it looks like it gonna take some time.
IOTA is worthless dog shit, don't waste your time.
Your money is good as gone
i n s o l v e n c y
yeah I had delays on ETH but have had before on occassion, good chance they're dealing with a surge in withdraws, could be bad if there is a scam
Sure I tried to setup an account there earlier but it refused to accept my password despite it passing all requirements... Could somebody else actually check this, try setup a new account there and see if they run into same problem, website and company could be dust already
When i wanted to withdraw iota it took me about 6 times going through the google authenticator and the numbers were correct everytime but bitfinex refused!
Looks like they're making it harder to withdraw
Ask iota centralized closed source servers what's their deal what a shitcoin
fucking lol
It took a day to withdraw OMG.
I'm getting seriously spooked about Bitfinex right now.
It appears as though they are running on fumes
44729084472807it will eventually get sent.
same thing with my account.
once it says pending, just wait and they'll send it.
mine took them about 8 hrs; they do mention they personally review some withdrawals
for those that don't know, bitfinex has always stated that withdraws can take 12 hours.
with the recent fud it's likely hot wallet especially for coins that dont see many withdraws have been depleted and cold storage is where things are being sent from, or sent from cold to the hot then out, all of these things taking times for the blockchains or tangles to confirm and then send to your personal wallet.
