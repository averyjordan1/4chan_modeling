What's the best time to buy into a decent altcoin?I always trying and buy low but then the price keeps on going lower...And I can't for the life of me figure out when bitcoin is going to stop mooning.
Shit is overbought 90% of the time it seems.
buying now or a little later wouldn't be a bad decision.
