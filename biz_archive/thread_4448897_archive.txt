its back down.its not king because you get more out of sbit coins.
btc looks good only if you invested at 700 and below
back down
only a few manage to beat the btc gains by day trading alts.50% should ALWAYS stay in btc for most of since since we are brainlets.
God dammit not again!Why won't btc let my alts moon?!
?Why /biz?
I bought 1 BTC earlier in the year and lost .5 of it day trading.
Went from $2100 -> $1050.I bought 1 BTC later in the year at $3900 and haven't touched it.Now I'm $10k.Pretty dumb how if I just didn't trade any alts I'd be at $16k right now kek
10k mid december
made out of 5btc 0.04
implying everyone is bad at this as you rofl.
I lost 1 btc margin trading when it dipped to 7450.
I don't wanna live anymore.
we are in snowball mode now
Blame normies and tether.
your brain is very small if you think i was talking about anything but my own mistake in that post
It will very violently retrace back to 8000-7950 but then rise up quickly.
Happened already
And the altcoin JUSTing continues.
is it too late to buy bitcoin?
yes
