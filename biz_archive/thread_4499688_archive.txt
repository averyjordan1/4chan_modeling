Hey Anon, I saw a few posts about GVT in here yesterday and I did some further research.
This coin is an absolute GEM!They're trying to disrupt the 70 trillion dollar Private Trust Management market.
Only 3M tokens in circulating supply and the market cap is barely 10M.
One thing that made this team gain my trust a lot was the fact that they burned their unsold ICO tokens rather than keeping them.
That's a rare thing in this world of money-grab ICOs.They have all round good guy and crypto god Charlie Shrem advising and investing in the project.
He is great at PR and is connected as FUCK.
The devs have promised a TREX listing soon.
This coin listed o 4 exchanges within 24 hours of ICO completion.
Charlie Shrem is a BEAST!

You don't want to not be holding when this coin hits TREX (devs have confirmed this).
DYOR as always but I am bull as fuck on this coin.
If this coin goes to just $50m marketcap it is already 5X for us!
