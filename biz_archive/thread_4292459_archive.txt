Anyone else notice the amount of accumulation on Vericoin?Buy orders always coming in keeping the price around the 7000sats mark which gets slowly eroded as there are just a lack of buyers.Very similar price action prior to shooting up to 13000satsWould be good to get shot down so I don't buy another shitcoin
