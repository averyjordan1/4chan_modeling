What questions would you guys like me to ask SWIFT?
Will you guys being adopting ChainLink's tech, once mainnet is done?Also, ask, how much Link should I buy?
Have you heard of ripple and are you doing anything to fight off their disruption.
This, and/or something about "the oracle problem"
Press them on their Proof of Concept involving Iso 20022 they're releasing the report on in December.
Ask about smart contracts and what they think of their futures uses, and if SWIFT will use smart contract technology.
Get them talking about blockchain and try to press for LINK references.

44374024437091What specifically about ISO 20022 would you like me to ask them?I will ask all the other suggestions given here as well.
Wtf?
Of course they’ve “heard” of Ripple.
Ripple is SWIFT’s biggest competitor.Why do you think they partnered with ChainLink?
Ask about „how important are smart contracts gonna be now that the oracle problem has been solved?“
Bottom line, do your best to get them to talk about ChainLink without actually outing yourself as a shill.
you idiot we know that we just need to goad it to come from their mouths
