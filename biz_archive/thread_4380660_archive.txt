>/biz/ used to have actual good crypto information>now it's only scammers, shills with fake articles and beggarsFUCK YOU REDDIT
Where are some good sources of information on crypto?
Since biz has gone to shit I've been struggling
No idea m8
I'm going to find some YouTube channels, Twitter accounts and maybe forums over the next few days/weeks and I'll make a thread about it hereIn the mean time anyone with good info is welcome to check in
Would be much appreciated mate!
The shilling has lately gotten so bad that there isn't even any humore left in it.
It's almost time to leave /biz/.
The memes have ran dry.
I've just moved on to looking at TradingView.com analysts.
It has been like a breath of fresh air.
4chan is so negative and full of shills that you will not learn a fucking thing here and it just makes you feel like shit.
4381452You can thank the bch niggers for that.
There is a thread on reddit exposing their botting and astroturfing.
Yeah Iâ€™m new to biz and while there are some really good threads, on every fucking refresh there are 3+ shill threads for some other dumb fucking shitcoin.
These threads really affect the quality of the board in a bad way.
if only the deluded linkies with the pathetic shill attempts were gone...
This board used to be pretty comfy.
I still remember ETH threads before the mooning.
Shit became unbearable after 1st major BTC crash.
Solar and powr are annoying me the most

FUCK YOU REDDIT
