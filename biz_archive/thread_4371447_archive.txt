In 1971, Nixon terminated the USD backed by gold reserves.
Since then all central banks, so to speak, are backed only by our trust.
Will crypto change this?
there will be a new international monetary agreement next year but this is the first one in 100 years that is not going to be an ameican reserve curencyyou will experience the greatest inflationary event of all history and the only way to protect yourself from it is precious metals and crypto
crypto is backed by trust and by the way, central banks are backed by force.
no lol
usd is backed bullets and missiles anon, can you trust me not to use it?
im worried.
i keep hearing people say we are due for a stock market collapse and recession next year.
except this might be the big one, as the problems in 2008 were not stopped, just delayed
central banks are backed by force>Every grocery store in the country decides to double its prices>every state decides to triple the minimum wage>Thinking the big bad military can "back" the value of your money when it's being fucking destroyed by Jews on the inside
that is exactly why people say fiat always reverts to its true value eventually.
it will mean wwIII
The only trust involved in crypto is that you trust the actors in the system act in their own interests.You trust miners to mine selfishly, because that's how they get paid.You trust altcoin chains to capitalise on any kind of fuckery in the larger chains in terms of censorship/fungibility compromises etc, because that's how they get paid.You trust traders who evaluate the competing chains to capitalise on any deviation from the fair market value represented by their underlying properties, because that's how they get paid.You don't have to trust that any other party is working in *your* interests.
Which is the big historical divergence between crypto and traditional banking systems.
Yes.
Bitcoin Gold is backed by gold, so no trust is needed to maintain its value.
