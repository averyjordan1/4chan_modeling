HOLD THE FUCK UP.I have 10k Metaverse ETP...
I finally moved it to a wallet because Bitfinex isn't serving US customers anymore...I can "freeze" my coins for interest?
No way I'm going to freeze for a year, but I can freeze for a week witha 0.0959 % return rate...$36,000 x 0.0959 = $3452.40I CAN MAKE OVER 3000 DOLLARS A WEEK FREEZING MY STACK?
WHAT THE FUCK?!!?!
?Can someone confirm if this is true??
Sounds a little too good to be true...
It's legit, froze for a year myself.
Keeping stuff to play with.
No wait I'm retarded, it would actually be a multiplier of .000959 since it's 0.0959%.
That's only 24 bucks a week.
FUCK.
.09*100=9%you're thinking .009 KEK why am I even here
Are you stupid?
.0959% of 36k is like $34.524Lol

mfw someone can be so retarded that they can't comprehend the difference between 9% and 0.9%
Fuck freezing for a year... Masternode coins are where its at, I'm running 5 nodes of a coin I got for free back in 2014... the collateral is worth about 2.5BTC.... but running them as nodes nets almost $500 a week... and the 5 VPS servers only cost me like $0.90 a day ... literally doing nothing and collecting more than a mcdonalds worker every week
