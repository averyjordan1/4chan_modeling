daily reminder that CAT is an upcoming moon mission, a platform for creating and selling smart contracts, beta is coming up in december and platform in q1 2018
No real world use.
No one will use it.
Token is worthless and was served merely to allow for an ico moneygrab.
no real world use ?
so you tell me everyone is an expert in creating secure smart contracts ?
and everyone wants to put time into it as well ?they are working on products helping normies design, create and sell smart contracts.
future shit with a good usecase, but sure solve the oracle problem with your linkies or whatever
I read that they hired a lot of new developers as well.
Excited about the news in December.
If this goes on Binance this could be big.
give up pajeet.
no one is buying into this scam project
stay poor
I trust him, Vitalik and the other nerds way more than some pajeet businessmen furr surr
Despite the low price the dev team is actually legit and has been working hard on this.
All CAT needs is a good exchange (and there have been rumors of binance) and it will shoot to $10.
