BUY BCH NOW....oh wait, nvm.
It's a shitcoin knock off run by a convicted felon and his crony crew.It's been riding .2 steady, and it ain't going up.
No matter what some Floridians say.If you own BCH - sell or risk shedding moar tears.
Thank you for the sound advice core shill, your message is right on point.
That's not an attempt to fool people, it's a joke/play on words.
daily remember
Been riding .2 when it was .05 a month ago.
How is that not going up you NEET?
I'm at work and don't have my image folder accessible.
Googled "fake," and that was one of the first results.
It went up due to an artificial pump... it was literally a coordinated operation.
This should scare the shit out of BCH holders who believe in the decentralized vision of BTC.Yes, it may go up in the future.
But those who are sitting on their PCs right this second starting at exchanges waiting to pounce - are wasting their time.
