How will this ICO affect chainlink?
Is it worth dropping my bags before this enters the market?

This ICO project has nothing to do with ChainLink lolWTF anon.
I saw the words "oracle" and "smart contract".
Is it not doing the same thing as chainlink?

I don't get this insane FUD.
Did people just run out of things to FUD with and started throwing shit at a wall?I suppose this could actually just be a shill thread for OPs coin.
Get people to look at it by invoking Link.
Has nothing to do with oracles even though it has "oracle" in its name.
