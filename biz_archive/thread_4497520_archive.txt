I want to buy a shitcoin.Does it matter if I go with Bitcoin or ETC?
Both have it for trade.
The price could be slightly higher or lower on one pair if that matters to you.I generally recommend ETH as it's faster & cheaper to deposit.
The downside is the volume is usually quite a bit lower on the ETH pair, but I've never had that be an issue.
not quite sure what you are asking
buying shitcoins on the cusp of mt gox 2.0no, just no.either move to ETH or cash out to fiat.
anything else is too risky.
Pretty much what this guy  just answered.Also, do I have to pay a % per trade?
That would suck dicke.
g. a fee for BTC -> LINK and then another fee for ->BTC.
Depends on the exchange, some decentralized exchanges do charge fees for trades/placing orders/etc.Since you've got the option of BTC & ETH pairs, you probably don't have worry about that.
Most exchanges (i.e.
Bittrex, GDAX, Binance) only charge fees when you withdrawl.So, BTC -> exchange will cost you the BTC transaction feeThen LINK -> wallet will cost you whatever the exchanges fee is for withdrawing.
buy lgd
My point was more like.What if I am with POWR, but want to buy LINK now?
I need to change it from POWR to BTC and then to LINK.
I do not get charged on those movements, right?
So if you deposit BTC trade to POWR, and thenwant to trade that POWR for LINK, you'll have to then sell the POWR for BTC, then use that BTC to buy LINK, which fortunately if you're using any of the earlier mentioned exchanges you won't have to pay any fees for any of those movements.
You'll just get hit with a fee if you decide to withdraw the LINK to a wallet instead of leaving it on the exchange or trading it for something else.
That was the question.I was pretty sure, but wanted to confirm.Thanks man.
hope you are having a good day.
