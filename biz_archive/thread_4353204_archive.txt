Still freefalling
volume is dropping like a rock on bittrex
It is happening regardless of Koreans or your post.
i hope so.
i just bought some because i just buy whatever is making you guys post red wojaks
Looking at bithumb right now and it's falling.
Don't believe what you read on twitter accounts featuring D.Va
why would korean whales pump on bittrex?
Are you gonna fall for this scam a second time /biz/?
Really?

ScamBut I made a lot of money the last time
Considering going all in guys.Someone stop me.
Never go all in.
Go half in keep other half to buy dip to break even
Wait a bit, see if the trend reverses or not.
Price has been steady for ages now.You should have been in when it hit atl few weeks ago.
going all in on a falling asset.
Don't do it bro.t.
currently holding .23 bags
i feel ya senpai, only i was still drunk from the night before and tried to scalp at 0.41 to 0.42, if i woke up an hour later i would have been up 30% rather than be down 50%
on an unrelated note, i think there is still a good chance of another pump, maybe not to ath but seeing as pretty much the whole of korea and some chinese are bagholding they could bring out the big guns out of saltyness if nothing else, only problem is the exchanges, they sure as shit wont be using bithumb again.
yeah, buying low?
what a fucking retard
To be fair, going all in on a rising asset would be much more retarded.
pumping started on coinexchange
The pumps are getting progressively more ineffective.
Can't wait for people to dump on everyone again when they convince them the 'flippening' is still on.
God it's so fucking easy
