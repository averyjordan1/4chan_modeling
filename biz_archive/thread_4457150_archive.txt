Beware, a bearish TKx cross inside the Kumo is going to happen in the next two hours unless a major jump upwards happens before then.
If the strength of this dip is strong enough to send it below the cloud, an even larger dip would occur.
Make sure you have your stop losses set.Love,Lain

I see you out here.
i dont understand
The only place NEO will crash today is on the moon, stop the fud man

You might want to check your cloud settings.
Those are set for stocks, not crypto.

Sup lain from the LTC thread.
What coins are good for daily 1-1.5% gains using (cloud,MADC,stoch RSI).
What coins are you trading with atm?
And how do you decide your stop loss?
are you crazy?
are you not aware they just got 3 new developers on board
He's right.
I just got announced on Twitter.
Interesting...This will be some nice ying and yang.
Lets see how it plays out in the immediate price movement.
Might be a dip followed by a nice moon, or maybe the news will be enough to boost it regardless.
I still think we'll see a dip though.
I go through a bunch of charts on Tradingview until I find something that looks good based on TA, then run more TA on it.
Right now SYS is looking nice.
Large moon potential by end of week.
Stop loss is either set -5 to -7% range or based on trends and previous support/resistance.Learn what signals to look for, like upward stoch rsi cross, how to read cloud signals, etc., then scroll through charts until you spot potentials.
