So, what happens in the event of a complete BTC crash, being that everything is valued relative to BTC?
Would everything just get absolutely fucked, or would the junior varsity squad (ETH, LTC, VTC, XMR, etc) just go through the roof?Not FUDing, just curious, as anyone who doesn't know the answer to this question should be :-) Also, does anyone know of an exchange where you can buy alts with LTC?
