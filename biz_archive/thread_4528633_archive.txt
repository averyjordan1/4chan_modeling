Researching new coins and looking for suggestions on coins that are soon to hit exchanges.So far my most interesting find is ChainTrade.
Guess it's going to be like robinhood but for commodities.
That's big money and they even said on TV that they think they will have 100 billion market cap by 2020.I don't think I've ever heard ANY coin predict such insane ROI.
Worth tossing some coins at just in case they actually deliver..
I can't parse this one, two sentences in the pic to a coherrent meaning.
Can you translate?
I put 1 ETH into it at ICO.
Not much, but didn't have much to spend either.
If they deliver what they hope and plan then I'll still be a millionaire in some years
Wasn't easy, but translated it means:I'd beg you to fuck me every time you start undressing if it wasn't for the fact that I get speechless every single time
WaBi.
Get in as early as possible, it's going to be enormous.
ah right, makes sense
DragonChain looks good, also shilled by cryptogator that usually goes 5-10x, i think it'll go on trex or binance but on EthTrader first
Gvt, buy before it hits bittex (hint: it will soon)
proof or no dice.
Too many devs promise the ttrex and dont deliver.
OP if thats actually you...>creeper 1000%
where do you think we are
I thought this was match.com?
