this has been a very uneventful past 2 months if you have been holding altcoins
HOW ABOUT A YEAR.
altcoins...
Honestly I'd be happy with 10 btc at this point but I'm not going to give up and sit on 2.5
If you look at satoshis I bought EMC2 at just under 1900.
Its back where it was satoshi-wise, but worth way more USD.
WHEN... really WHENBTC crashes AGAIN.
Alts will pump and I will dump and pick up cheap bitcoin.It's actually a really exciting time because you haven't missed the rocket to the moon yet.There are daily flights of 20%+ if you diversify you might catch one.But you already know this...
yeah if you bought link kekI bought BCH at $800 and sold at $2300I bought POWR at $0.17 and I am holding (currently 0.67)maybe uneventful for you cuck.when I sold my BCH was the best day of my fucking life.
Holding a literal shitcoin>Nothing but gainsSpeak for yourself
