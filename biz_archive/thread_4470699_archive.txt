Just fucking buy BTC/ETH/LTC you brainlet since they're available on coinbase and normalfags are gonna use coinbase when they FOMO hard.

Literally best advice I can give is try and think like a logician for each trade you make.Do not let emotion cloud your judgement.Employ stop loss' and trailing stop and limit orders etc.Lastly HODL.
Unless its a shitcoin going down (which you shouldnt have bought in the first place) then just hold.The amount of trades that initially dipped down 10% but then recovered to make significant gains...
I can't even...
If you need help thinking like a logician then I recommend you learn probability theory, concept of +ev (if you don't even know that) and at the very least economic game theory.Don't just learn them though implement them in your heuristics and decision making when trading.
ThisI recommend taking a couple of undergrad course in statistics, definitely an analysis and forecasting class.Always run a backtest on your data and test the validity of your model before making a trade and use machine learning to analyze the memes here to forecast potential upcoming trends in the market.
