No isn't that BitInfo Charts that updates hourly?
if you head to the main page you'll see what seems like realtime activity.
WhAT THE FUCKKKKK!K!K!!K!K?!?!?
Yea on bitfinex, the massive a fuck manipulated exchange.
I don't see this shit on bitter n on the korean exchanges
Okay, BOOOOOOOM, not quite $1500 but back down to $1700-$1800.
Still looks pretty bad, but still hodling like hell.
Still on top.
Going back up.
Bittrex is freezing like crazy.
I don't even know what's real anymore
Pretty sure the koreans have started a pump that was so massive it will blow up in their own faces and they will have to buyback BCH
randomly wake up at 5AM and decide to short some coins>ride the BCH wave all the way from $1200 to $2500>pretty much sold at the peakMade about $1500 this morning.
For once I did something right I suppose.
Ok, serious question.
Is Bitcoin kill?
What's going to happen?
bitcoin cash is kill, bitcoin mooning, expect 8.5-9k by december
Of course you don't see it bc bitthumb.com got shut down.
Even the koreans couldn't stomach this shit :D
Bitcoin cash is killHow?
Good job.
>watching price the entire day>its been rising non stop>decide to buy a few and sell for some quick money >starts crashing just after i boughtWHAT THE FUCK THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT
bittrex crashed right on 0.042
did you just wake up?
Just watch me flush this away because I just can't stop trading with this shit.
*0.42
Same.. what a mess
same .
got in at .4 and sold and .41 because foresight.
mfw spent all day making conservative buys and sells, never buy more than 30% worth of bch>mfw aware the whole time that when the dump comes it's gonna come like raging down like a fucking comet>mfw I'm actually in when it comes.
had sold at like .405, get in again at .415. watch it go up to .44 or something>it tumbles down to .42 in the blink of an eye>IMMEDIATELY put up sell order for .395, get out in time>mfw up 20% today>mfw holding 100% btc right nowC O M F YOMFY
this is a joke right...
no.
why would it be?
buy high sell low
I bought at .11, sold at .15 when it got a little slow.
then bought again on .18 and rode it to .215.
Then from .22 to .29 and so on.
I made a profit on every trade, except the last one i bought at .415 and nope'd the fuck out at .395.
I'm up from 9 btc when i woke up today to 11.C O M F YO M F YM F Y F YY
Down and down.
No survivors
using coinmarketcap for prices>not using the actual exchanges where they are actually tradedlol
