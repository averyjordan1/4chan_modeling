Bitcoin Gold never happened though.
Isn't it coming out tomorrow?
The gains are just as real if you had bought at .019 though
Is it?
I've lost track because its been announced on several dates only to then have nothing happen.
i believe today's pump was due to tomorrow release confirmation could be wrong thoughseriously btx is the real deal
