>when you make more money trading on the weekends than you do at your jobMy entire career is a joke
do you day trade?
how much do you normally make?
wagecuck'd
mcdonalds isn't a career
I know that feel desu.
I have two years until I'll finish my BSN degree and the only thing I see it as is a means of more money to dump into cryptotrading where I'll have 3-4 days off a week to keep up to date.
Traders all get REKT sooner or later, it's always just a matter of time.
Give it a few more weekends, you'll be thankful soon for your wagecuck job.

Except you have a way out.
