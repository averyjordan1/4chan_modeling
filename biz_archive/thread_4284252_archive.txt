I still didn't dump my BCash and the current pump is making my total BTC reach 21 BTC.
Should I dump BCash yet?I don't know for how long Roger Ver can continue manipulating both BTC (keeping it down) and BCH (keeping it high) at the same time.
Nope, BCH gained 4 billion in the last 8 hours, while BTC had lost 7 billion.The failed fork is forcing the flippening
You should take a 365 day nap desu.
There's too much confusion, I can't get no reflief.
Roger, go to bed.It's clear.
Roger Ver is really mad after 2x's cancellation and wants to push the "see, people want big blocks" narrative by dumping his BTC and pumping his BCash, probably in hopes of trying another hardfork in the future.
The question is for how long can he sustain this.Realize that the actual big whales in Bitcoin are all anti hardforks.
MP didn't even dump his BCash yet and he has around 550,000 BTC (known), that would destroy BCash's market at any time he wanted.
This doesn't even include the rest of the BTC held by his partners.
And this doesn't even include the BTC held by whales that are not in the WoT but still are against hardforks.
The volume is all Korean.
They will move on.
Wait for the chinese to wake up man.
