I've got the trading yipsI made the most amazing trades for months, money hand over fist.
suddenly the last 3 i haven't been able to win at all, All my trades ahve been shit, every call i make has been terrible.
Its like the market pulled a rug out from underneath me.
The more i lose the worse the yips get, i constantly second and tripple guess every action, overthinking to the point were i miss opportunists, Or i just avoid the risk all together.
I don't know when to buy or sell anymore, its like all my skill has disappeared.
HOW DO I GET RID OF THE TRADING YIPS?
Biz plz help me get my grove back.
>implying crypto is anything more than luck
dump everything into your favorite coin.
start looking for good buy in points on others you like.
start trading small amounts.
