I think I need to check into crypto rehab.I believed the LINK meme a little too much and over-invested.
Now i'm down 40 grand in the hole thanks to you fucks, which is causing me to re-evaluate my life.I used to be an addict and honestly this crypto stuff is much worse to my finances.
I want off Mr Bones' Wild Ride.
