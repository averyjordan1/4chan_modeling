Newfag here wanting to get into the coin business.
I have 2 quick questions.1) What exchange or market do you guys use for buying coin?2)Do I really need to use a computer that has never been connected to the internet for cold storage or is that only if you are wanting to hold large amounts of cash in one wallet?
I'm only just testing the waters and plan on buying $10 of a few coins for fun.Thanks.
Bump.
For that amount just leave it on an exchange.
Enable 2FA to be safe.
See it like this: I create a website where people can trade coins.
I offer to hold them for you in an online wallet that I control.
I have a good reputation.
Would you trust me with $100?
Would you also trust me with 10,000?
100,000?
There you got your answer of when you need your own wallet and how much security measures you take against keyloggers, hackers, etc.Keep in mind that Bitcoin and many other cryptos are designed so YOU have control over your money and no 3rd party like banks.
That's why a pursit would probably advice you to have a cold storage wallet even for $10.
But from a practical perspective - see above.Anyways, your $10 might get eaten up in fees of buying / cashing out...
Thanks for the answer.
