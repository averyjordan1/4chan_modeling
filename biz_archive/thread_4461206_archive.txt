I fucking fail at everythingBut a few years ago I had some money and made money with it.
I had like 5k and made 20kThen I became a drunk.
I didn't realize what I had.
I just drank it away because my life was #yoloFuck man.
I could be a fucking billionare if I used my winnings wisely, as I used them before.I started with 5K in 2008 and turned it into something like 2 mil.
I just drank and partied it away.
I am worthless.
I am doing a wagecuck job right now and don't think its fucking lost on me what I could be now.I fucking cashed out so early and used my winnings in online poker because I was drunk all the time.its funny because I initially made the money completely sober daytrading options and crypto.FUCk I'm pretty drunk right now, but if I had HODL I would literally be a billionare.I had it and actively lost it.My wife just left me and I think I'm going to kill myyself.I have nothing left.
I can't bank on 1000x again, the best I have is programming a trading bot.FUCK MAN
So sorry to hear about that bro.
I just sent you 5 ETH.
I just reread this and I meant that I cashed out at 2 mil in 2008.as I said I'm pretty drunk
fucking kill meI could be a billionaire if I didn't squander my initial winningsmy wife leaving me is kind of fucking me up, one ofthe reasons I didn't HODL is because she wanted some shit.
like shoes or something.
I loved her and gave it to herplease fucking kill me for believing a woman
i'm going fucking insaneI laid dirt out and tried to write a message to her in it, over and overI was too drunk and just did this for hours.eventually I wrote her this
