4364074His last tweet was less than a week ago.
Replace BTC with LINK and date May 2018.Shit bricks.
deluded

th post best post
FUCK
OPTIMISM
I bought 20 BTC at $11, sold at $13.
Should I feel worse than you guys who were not even aware BTC existed?
These kind of hypotheticals are pointless.
It literally does not matter if you could have made money but didn't.
What if you haven't made it?No point in ruining yourself over this.As teenager I got 5 out of 6 right in lotto, few days prior I gave my father the ticket, since I was not old enough to give it in.
My father just kept it in his car.When he noticed what he did, he disappeared for 3 weeks.Sucks, but it shouldn't destroy someone.
it's over
Whatever, how many of you spent tons of btc on silkroad?
Yet no one kills himself because of it.Shit happens.
No one knew it would explode this hard, I think we all thought it was just a trend or bubble that wouldn't last too long.Nowadays with so many alts and shit being offered there's way more chances to make it but also more chances to go broke.It's about being on the right side at the right time.
