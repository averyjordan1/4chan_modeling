What the hell happened why did Ark just tank?!?!?!
I just want to go back to our glory days
another slide thread to distract from BCH MOONING
Fuck your BCH shilling.
What the hell just happened to ARK?
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
BCH is mooning and BTC is stable above 8.1, and the overall market cap is still relatively unchanged.
What happened is all the dumbfucks fomoed into BCH when they saw it mooning.
This market is full of 5 year olds, that's what happened.
