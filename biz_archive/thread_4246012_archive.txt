Holy shit,I'm on the bitfinex discord, I dont want to give away too much but the tethers being printed are not for BTC, they're for chainlink.
It's going to be listed post fork and all the profit will go into pumping chainlink.Prepare for eze money.
Holy shit.
This is a good thread
Why exactly do people think the tethers are illegitimate?
Maybe they got something like 500 million in institutional money, and can only create tethers (or bitfinex chooses to buy them) in increments of $25mil.
Is there conspiracy beyond people seeing tethers being minted and assuming a ton of shit?
