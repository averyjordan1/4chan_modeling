D-d-delete
A ton of alts are mooning right now.
POWR is killing the BCH flippening.
Literally no one cares about BTC vs BCH now
>Mooninglmao
It's not mooning it barely gained.Be patient.
Chances are nothing major will happen until in 2.5 days earliest.
If you see spikes of 100 USD before then, it's just smaller whales deciding to dump their BTC for BCH, either because they think it will flip all the way or they're going to try to dump close to whatever they think the top of the next pump is.
There was a whale that had a half mil sell wall all night, and was literally accumulating millions on another addy .
Sell walls are down now.
up we go.
Sell BCH to Physical Gold at 5.8K.
le zoom out memekysthis is happening, deluded corecuck
Nothing is happening.
bch will be 5.8k?When??
Parity.
Two Ships Passing in The Night.
whales accumulating already 6btc buy wall eaten with secs
BCH holders will be filthy rich in a few more days, so yeah life is good...
The inverse trend of mining profitability...
no you retard.
Bcash has no fucking devs.
have fun with your 100Gig blocks while BTC uses lightning and cross atomic swaps
remember when mooning meant the relative price moving upwards in a significant manner?all it's managing is not to circle the pan.i've got an unknown amount of monero :^)
