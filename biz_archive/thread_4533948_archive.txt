I am expecting this coin to shoot up to 5-7$ from the current levels (x-2x) in the next week by seeing the current initiatives and the volume on exchanges.
Previous ATH is arround > 3.8 i think.For sure a long term hold, expecting around > 50$ by 2018 Jan.PS: DYOR
Buy this after few weeks, now it's FOMO and baghold time, thanks me later.
