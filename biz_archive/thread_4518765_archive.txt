Heh, stocks.....
BUY MY BAGS>WHEN YOU BUY MY BUYS ILL TRY TO FUCK Ulol at least youre an honest faggot.
i'm not selling... maybe when the price gets to 0.00025 i'll sell 10k.
keep the rest for exchange listing.i really did just fuck with a couple of pajeets orders, and make them move it down.
if you don't believe me, i'll put my sell infront of his again and make him go even lower!interested?
this is easy money if you buy at that price, just look at the orderbook, everythings around .00004 to .00006, the rest is trivial.
Scam.
