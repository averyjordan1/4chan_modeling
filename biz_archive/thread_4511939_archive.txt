/biz/ should be split into 2 boards./coin/ for cryptocurrency and similar topics.
Potentially including the traditional stock market as well.
(Bonus points if board is named /shill/)/biz/ for business, entrepreneurship, and similar topics.Discuss.
Cryptocurrency has literally nothing to do with business, but makes up 95% of the topics.
Fuck you.
Cryptocurrency would be /biz/.
Regular business would be /NoCoiners/ or /wagecucks/
the entire reason why this board was made in the first place was cryptocurrency, newfag
Hey retard
I think you're a nocoin faggort, but I do think it would be funny if the crypto board was called /cry/
No coiners are literally the worst kind of scumEven worse than Linkies or Shitcoin Cash bagholders
no coiners are scum.but i agree, crypto should have a separate board

biz is for crypto forever.otherfags can make their own board.
call it truebiz or some other reddit shit
lmao imagine being such an autist that you care about this>WE MUST PRESERVE THE QUALITY OF THIS BOARD
