.1Oh good glad it's gonna keep it up after the coin's effectively dead
inb4 it gets pulled.
Maybe he just likes the way it makes the chart look
Of course.
It's just Ver & Co signaling that the flippening has not been abandoned and that BCH holders shouldn't sell, and that people who believe the flippening will succeed should acquire BCH now while it's low if they want gains.
You realize that BCC is not Bitcoin Cash, right?
It is on Binance at least.
it is on bittrex
oh shiiiiit.so used to binance.Wait.
Seriously bitconnect?
I guess someone is just trolling then.
brittex has it as BCC
4370806gotcha, didn't know.
That's weird.
roger "demolition man" ver would never abandon usflippening by the end of the week
Coin funds itself by paying people the profits of its appreciation.Coin stops appreciating.Holy fuck this is gonna be so terribly good.
I honestly feel sorry for anyone who gets fucked by this ponzi scheme.
I mean compared to the % gains of other cryptos I can understand how this coins payouts would seem more official from a newbies point of view.
But holy fuck is this gonna be once a once a year, maybe 2 yrs, kind of entertainment.
Im debating not fapping until this thing crashes.
I think itll be that good.If you thought DGB marines were bad.
At least that coin actually has solid pros to it.
People are going to kill themselves over BCC
It's BCH.But yeah Bitconnect shittering is going to be glorious.

Oh Hi Mark!
I can't wait until he starts moving that up and destroys every btc hodlers life forever.
You think there aren't major BTC holders who couldn't do the same thing with their earned BCH from the fork if they didn't want it moving?
No they are too busy stroking off onto their cold wallets
