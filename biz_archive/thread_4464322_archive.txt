I'm not sure why you guys are laughing at Confido.
This is the type of stuff that hurts growth for all cryptocurrency.
I agree that holding something that went 25x in 2 days is a terrible strategy, but that doesn't make Confido's exit scam funny.
stfu jackass
I hope it destroys confidence in ICOs so all these scammers rekt themselves once and for all.
u know whats funnyur face cuckboi
yes it does actually, and how does one shitcoin plummeting hurt any of the thousands of other shitcoins?
i bet you made this thread because you bought at the top or you didnt sell at x25.
The Confido super ALPHAs sold for BTC - redistribution of wealth from morons to uber rich.
People throw thousand $ on a scammy compagny without verifying anything.They deserve to loose money.

A good life for our self or our families.
Some people had that dream crushed yesterday .
Luckily for them we are still early on in the greatest transfer of wealth in history.
