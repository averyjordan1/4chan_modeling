It really couldn't be simpler.If you want to make it, buy ELLA and hold.
It's going to be a $100 coin.ELLA is an ETH fork that is superior to ETH.
If ETH can be a $34 billion market cap coin, ELLA can be a $1-10 billion.Circulating supply is only 2,231,630 ELLA right now.
By the time 50 million are mined, it will easily be $100/coin, maybe more if ETH is abandoned because skelator is a cuck and BTC isn't as versatile.
Every day volume, price, and buy order book is increasing, all organically.
I actually don't have nearly as much ELLA as I want, but I have enough to "make it" when ELLA reaches $100, and you do too.
So stop making excuses.
This is /ourcoin/ and the fudders will fail in all their attempts to keep it down.https://stocks.exchange/trade/ELLA/BTC
