Neo is about to explode guys, BCH has settled, this is the last opportunity before it explodes.
looks like its about to go down senpai
Go into RCN.
should have a nice steady yield today
Wait for meeee
Say that to the 122BTC buy wall LMAO
NEO isn't going down anytime soon.Next year we will be talking about the flippening between ETH and NEO.
I somehow expected gains from the asian market but it looks like I was wrong.
Would say we're slowly going down since people take profit.
You do know what walls are for right?
You dont actually think those are heaps of eager buyers, right?
Don't sell we are about to see the next 30 - 300 if this weekend goes well.
It's only going to go up, the TA shows it, we have an insane amount of news, no FUD whatsoever.
Nothing stealing the spotlight now.As we approach closer to the announcement date the FOMO will only exponentially grow!Even if it is a shit announcement we will still get lots of gains leading up to it.
I'm selling 50% just before the announcement to be safe.
why?
LOL what coin are you looking at?
This is not NEO.
BCH has settled?
It is forming a bull pennant
When are you guys going to learn that no amount of TA will work with bitcoin.
It's wrong almost all of the time.
Once it stops making me money
