>when you realize there's a high prbability that all of crypto will one day crash to 0 and all the gains, losses, and effort won't matter because you would have lost it all anywayThis is why I buy and hold.
Consider all money invested in crypto as lost money.
Come back a year or two and check on it.
If it went up, great.
If it crashed, that's money you were ok with losing anyway.
Pretty much.
I've been buying and holding lately, full fuck it mode.
I keep up with the prices and news, but no more "selling at a loss to jump on a moon rocket" bullshit.

I think it will crash more
I play around with like 10% of my crypto, chasing stupid moon missions with /biz/ and stuff, but most of my money is in long term investments.
high probabilitynot unless there's a high probability that a worldwide EMP attack goes off noThis is similar to saying there's a high probability that the internet will die or something.
