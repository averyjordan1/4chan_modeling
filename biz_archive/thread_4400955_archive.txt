Anyone else sick of Bitcoin maximalists calling altcoins frauds/scams when anyone with half a brain or not willfully ignorant knows that this Bitfinex tether bullshit is the BIGGEST fraud of all?
Even CME thinks so.> Six bitcoin exchanges underpinned the index as recently as April, when CME removed the Bitfinex and OKCoin exchanges after banks blocked their customers from wiring dollars in and out.
https://www.ft.com/content/4bbf1ef6-ca4a-11e7-ab18-7a9fb7d6163e20m new tethers and the price goes up $300.
If this the accusations are true and are discovered by the regulators then not only will this bring back BTC's price to 3 digits in a day it will also ruin crypto as a whole permanently.
I even saw threads where Bitcoin maximalists say its impossible to pump billions in marketcap with 20m tether.
Are you fags retarded?
But when people use the marketcap meme to speculate that Bitcoin's growth will be slow you guys say "but you dont need to pump billions to increase the marketcap by billions you brainlet".
The absolute state of bitcoiners lmao.
Sure, but by the time shit blows up we'll all be millionaires.
You sure about that buddy?
Whats stopping old money from shorting the CME futures and then opening an investigation against Bitfinex?Even if Bitfinex isnt included in the CME index, the Bitcoin price in every exchange will drop to 3 digits if they find out that fraudulent money has been pumping bitcoin for god knows when.
There would be NO BOTTOM.
No one will take crypto valuations seriously anymore.>Kek, bitcoin?
wat is this another tether pump like 2017/2018?
not falling for it
