I bet you've been waiting all day to brag about this.
Biggest loss?Technically: holding and not hedging on BTC.
Had like 17 BTC off like a 6k investment back in February, now itâ€™s more of a 18k investment with only 12k.As for losses?
None, learned when to fold quickly at a profit and not hold.
im betting on powr, otherwise im just gunna put a couple eth into a few promising ICO and hope for a 3-4x
Bought potcoin back in the May-June fiasco.
Around 5000sats, was only a couple weeks ago I realised I was back to even in usd.
Don't expect this to be potcoin's last moon
BAT, still waiting for it to come back, if ever.
Put everything into CVC
China fud shot me in the face.
was all in binance coin and neo.made it back by trading neo.

Not really, i dont care about impressing random ppl on a chink anime board, he asked.
Plus it might give deluded linkies or other losers some hope to bounce back.
Bought chainlink at 10k sats sold at 5k sats I lost 50% of my whole portolio and I've made it back by visiting multiple fucking moon missions daily.
I now super good at cataching these moon missions.
The wabi and Genaro network ICOs look like a highly likely moon mission, just going to throw 1 eth at each.
