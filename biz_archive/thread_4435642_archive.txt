Dions, bro.Discuss.
Trade insults.
JUSTed so hard.
We had a 2 month countdown for a buggy wallet.
100% synced but I can't even send coins out of my wallet to dump this shit.
At this point im forced to hodl even if it goes to 0 or 100$
You are probably on the wrong chain.
So glad I sold out of this after the countdown.
Probably one of the biggest shitcoins I've ever put money in.
I had a buy order that I forgot about and it got hit when the BTC bullrun started.
So glad that I sold for a tiny 1% loss.
But dions brah.
Pretty funny that the only people who got raped by dions were bagholders.
I'm a DIONS bro and I'M NOT SELLING
Bought it at 3 fucking 50 and sold at 2.60Best decision in my life after hodling for weeks.
Got onto 2x moon missions since then that I don't even care anymore.
Fuck their countdown to nothing and their shitty project.
I was a holder of this garbage coin and sold for $100 profit.
Thank god.
On top of that, this coin has the worst memes and literally nobody gave a fuck about it other than this board.
No volume, zero marketing, only on 1 exchange.
Terrible coin.
will you DIONS bro retards stop ruining IOC' name with your shitty rape meme
It's been a PR disaster, won't you say bee?
Who's butt hurt now bitch
