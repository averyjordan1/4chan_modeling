If I bought some cryptocoin and it blew up big, and I wanted to cash out, how would I do that?
Is there some intermediate step between the cryptocoin and FIAT currency?
If it's not one of the big altcoins like LTC or ETH you'll need to sell it for BTC and cash that out to fiat.
you need to pay your taxesgood luck with that hell
The same way you bought it but in reverse.
So there's no mid-step?
The crypto is sold for FIAT and immediately gets transferred to your bank (rather than being held still within the exchange until you choose to withdraw it)?How would you spend your money if it remained in cypto?
I'd put it into FENX to 10x your gains again
Coinbase.
So what if I wanted to sell Bitcoin but keep my money on the exchange, to avoid it coming out of the system (or having to go into my bank account, and then repurchase Bitcoin)?
