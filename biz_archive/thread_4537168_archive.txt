Long the IOTA dip.
Fucking easy money.
Potential 10-15% short term gains which is 30 to 45% with leverage.
Isn't that shit hacked?
It's going back down to 50 cents, don't buy now.
Wait a few days.Market will correct.GET OFF MY THREAD FUDDER
I'd say the fud dip is over.
IOTA team addressed it yesterday, people are just scared of buttfenix but it's not the exchange's issue, it's an IOTA issue.I don't give a shit about the coin, just playin charts.
The bittrex code found/rumor is nice too.

IOTA is a server not a crypto or tangle or anything like that
The coordinator is just for the testing phase.
The Tangle itself is decentralised, faggot.Once it gets into full release 1.0 we'll see great shit coming to the cryptoworld.
It's open-source, too!
Yeah I think you're actually right, bigger walls are forming, I closed my long and am now shorting.
Thanks anon I can def admit when I'm wrong
No.
OP here from that thread.
Actually it makes sense.
They're all invalid transactions, failed attempts at stealing iotas, and I suspect are probably the source of the backlog of transactions, causing delays throughout.
it's centralized>no!
well yes.
but maybe not in the future...
to difficult to grasp that concept?
hey guys IOTA gets faster the more people use it!>the community falls for the meme and writes programs that spam transactions >the devs claim it can easily do 1000 TPS>the spam causes the network to hit 24 TPS>devs come out and beg people to stop sending the spam transactions because it’s “attacking” the networkHave fun with your centralized shitcoin .
