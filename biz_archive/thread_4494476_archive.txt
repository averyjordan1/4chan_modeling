Is there a way to save my studies like RSI/MACD/MA so i don't have to constantly remake them every time i open the page?
Use TradingView or Coinigy
fuck i like bittrexes ui lol
Install the chrome extension 'Bittrex Enhanced' and it has the option to replace their charts with TradingView charts.
It also will convert prices to USD in the main market/wallet pages.
