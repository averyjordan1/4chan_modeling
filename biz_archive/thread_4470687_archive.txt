Linkmarines, let's all take a moment to praise Lord Sergey for never communicating with us.
Confido made an announcement and look what happened (pic related).
Reminder that Confido shilled for Chainlink
They weren't shilling Link anymore than Apple was shilling OMG because Jun has an IPhone.
Heh.. fair point
while we're sitting on our ass browsing /biz/ all day Sergey is either working his ass off getting the network ready or shilling Link to investors and giant corporations around the world by presenting at conferences so we can be rich one daythank you Sergey-san.
What a wholesome man.
In the same way Rolex counterfeiters shill for Rolex.
3 cents.
Holy fuck the joooooost.
