Where do I buy BCH?My Googleflu is weak.
literally every exchange offers BTC/BCH (or BCC).
If you want to use FIAT you won't havd enough time.
binance.com its called BCC on there, same thing as BCH
just make sure sure you dont buy Bitconnect instead of Bitcoin Cash, why they share the same name of different exchanges is retarded.
