guys where r your smug face LINK shill threads?
i mean, connect the dots r-right?
right.
connect the dots.
We're talking about BCH at the moment, will go back to talking about LINK later
accumulating every local dip, increasing my stack, preparing my spacesuitcouldn't be comfier with all that shitstorm going on with bctrash etc
the order book is always full of people buying these days.
I don't even understand what point you're trying to make.
LINK is still the most exciting prospect in crypto right now.
Iâ€™m thinking about buying LINK... good or bad idea?
What do you guys think the price can do?
Any LINK under $2 is a steal
look at rippleeveryone was saying the token is worthless, and for the banks it indeed doesn;t matter whether the coin is expensive or not, they can adjust the sent amount accordingly to its price, and yet it skyrocketed, the day Swift or other big company announces implementation is the day the rocket leaves the ground, and you bet your ass once this bitch hits 5-10bn MC it ain't leaving.
Look at NEM or Dash or other shitcoins sitting there doing nothing.
It's because bahgolders refuse to sell cheap.I'm don't even need LINK to hit the famous $50 mar, at $20 I'm already gonna be a millionaire

now is the time to buythat's a bargain
