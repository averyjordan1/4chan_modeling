Back during the antshares days, biz was fucking spamming this shit non-stop for weeks.
Now that its NEO and has a large marketcap it isnt discussed that much in biz anymore but r/Cryptocurrency is eating it up, acting like they found NEO, an undervalued coin.
Now biz is spamming the fuck out of LINK in the span of weeks and Reddit again has no idea, except for the bizbros in the LINKTrader sub.
Was biz also ahead of plebbit during the early ETH days?
kys fagetreddit is garbageso are you
>implying that LINK will be a moon mission
Same thing happened with everything that gets shilled on /biz/.
They jumped on WTC after it hit $5, before then they just claimed every WTC post was shilling for a shitcoin.
They jumped on VTC and GRS after it had already gone up like 60%.
They jumped on CFD after it had already gone up like 8x on ED.
Reddit is literally for normies that are more normy than actual normies.>Look at the portal cake my gf baked me!
updootsHonestly the most cancerous site I've ever been on.
i plan on buying link eventually, i just dont want to have my money sitting there doing nothing for potentially several months.
Would rather buy it at 30-40cents when it finally starts taking off
Because it is not a moon mission OP, it is shilling.No problem!
desu only reason i go on reddit is for gaming related stuff like tournament matchthreadsother than that its just a big fucking safe space with up and downvote buttons to push other minded people down the comment sectionor karma whoring
Let's be honest, we fud coins there so they don't buy them up while we accumulate.
Then we shill them there
You can easily distinguish shilling because of genuine hype and shilling because of pump and dump groups in biz.
I'd rather not 2x my money before buying into link
