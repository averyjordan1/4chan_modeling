You would be a fool not to buy Ark before this Fork.
During the past months, Ark has had a constant stream of updates, new exchange listings and more.
Each time, the price goes up a bit and is then immediately suppressed by extremely obvious whales who are clearly trying to accumulate before it increases in value.
Ark is one of the few currencies that actually have potential for the future and are not just pnd shitcoins.
Don't be deluded, don't be a no-Arkie.
LINK = ARK = Digibyte
240 Ark 2.5k link poorfag here.

>buy Ark>get JUSTedit's a simple formula
4248959155 Ark here, if he is going to make it, am i going to make it?
There is so much hate for ark in here why?
They are either larping to post unfunny memes or they are genuinely sad that they missed the last moon mission and are trying to justify it by pretending that it's going to crash.
Gal.
4-16"Am I therefore your enemy because I speaketh the truth?"
newfags who hopped on ChainLink around the 40 cent mark who are misinformed and think that ARK and LINK are direct competitors so they feel the need to put ARK down even though the projects have absolutely nothing to do with each othercombine that with the fact that ARK has been dipping since it's ATH about 2 months ago despite the fact that we've gone through 2 Bitcoin forks that have fucked over every altcoin holder in one way or another
Just look at this shit.
I have never seen such obvious manipulation in my life.
You guys need to look at the bigger picture rather then being a panicking faggot who sells the moment it goes down 1 cent.
424895930 ARK 500 REQI'm going to recover from the alt octobercaust or start robbing banks
most of them hold ark themself
I'm jealous of the whales that can actually manipulate the market like this but I also hate them so fucking muchI assume at this point they must have ARK in the hundreds of thousands, they can literally live off of staked ARK right now and never have to worry about money ever again but they just keep putting up those massive walls to manipulate the price.
welcome to ARK, one has to wonder what the price could be if the whales have stopped manipulating it
elephants and grasses
G..guys 
4249257It was a lot worse when it was only on bittrex.

Here's the screencap so that you can laugh at the pink wojaks who didn't buy ark
Sending love to the ARK bros. $12 by Q1 2018
I would literally cry tears of joy.With everything happening with it though, I bet it actually will reach that in 3 months.
could go to 20$ in Q1 2018 and 100$ in Q4 2018
$12-14 is the dream but realistically I think $6-$8 by xmas.I am speculating widely of course, I just have had great success with this coin and my gut instinct is with it.
While that would be amazing, I think what  said is more realistic.
For EOY 2018, though... the sky is the limit imo.
Reminder: 
Jk, real reminder:
Mobile wallet realease soon and then we will see some big announcement and after that the big fuckin ARKVM update which will lead us to 100$ Ark, IM PUMPED MY NIGGGUZZ
