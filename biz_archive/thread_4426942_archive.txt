Biz why is ripple such a fail coin?
Can't even hold 30 cents with news of amex.
Its actually pathetic how guaranteed the dump is everytime.
It dropped 90% from satoshi ATH, there's a lot of bagholders preventing it from mooning.
You need to stack up as much as you can.a coinbase adoption for the end of 2017 is very likely.You know what will come then.
Because the announcements at this time aren't actually using the token, even if they say the intend to use it down the track.
Until a big partnership emerges that will use XRP itself, it will only slowly rise.Also XRP is only valued in USD, sats don't mean shit.
If you look you 'll see it has only dropped below 15c once in the past 5 months and is currently holding some of its latest gains.
The last 3 pumps in august, Oct and now Nov have seen it form new floors from 15c to 18 to 20 and now 22c.
Its one of the few tokens that now holds its own in USD when BTC pumps OR dumps.
Its a safe hold in real dollar terms.
Decent insight.
Rare for biz.
Thanks
Seen the whales on this coin, they holy 100s of BTC worth wtf
