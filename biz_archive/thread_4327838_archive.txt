https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactionsLmao, look at the number of unconfirmed BTC transactions.
The sane person should get out of crypto completely until this shit blows over.
Turn down the autism.
thinking money ever sleepsthe unconfirmed tx have been trending downward since the hash power is back
And the vast majority of those transactions is BTC going to exchanges in order to be dumped, because no sane person, even BTC believers, would withdraw BTC from exchanges right now.Either way, BTC loses.
so has bitcoin
I bought at .26.
Sold all my bags at an 80% loss.If I could just ride this piece of shit to .50, I will have hope again.
Please god, give me on small break in my pathetic life.
its now 3x less profitable to mine than bitcoinExplain how this temporary dip in profitability matters for anything at all.There's a clear logic to how bitcoin works, and you seem to not be aware of it.
Good thing, can buy cheaper.
Stop chasing pump anon.
