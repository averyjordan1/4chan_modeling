Finally bought in at around 5M marketcap.
What is the lowest cap coin that Binance has listed?
As in, if the lowest cap coin on Binance = 10-20 MIllion we are smooth sailing
I bought at ICO, and some more when it hit Etherdelta.. sold at 120k.. Rebought at 60k.. sold at 240k and rebought again at 160k.. now I'm hodling for the proper interstellar mission.
Theres no doubt in my mind that this will be a 20 million MC coin, just needs a bit more hype and a less shit exchange (fuck kucoin seriously).
I'm ALMOST tempted to hodl it for a few months just because if some of this shit can reach 100 million.. why can't this?
yup.
no one uses kucoin
nice maymay
