HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHDEADDEADDEADDEADDEAAAAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WE WANT IT TO DIEWE NEED IT TO DIEOnce the crypto throne is empty all alts will go ape shit to claim it.
N-NOIT CAN'T DIE, I'M ALL IN SHUT UPAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
6300>”””dead”””Even more retarded than the notion that btc is dead is the notion that if it actually dies, something else will take it’s place.Do you realize how devastating that would be to the crypto market?
Bitcoin, by far the most trusted coin, goes to zero or whatever you’re expecting.
Normies won’t touch this market with a 10’ pole and you can forget about institutions.
All the boomers who called crypto a bubble will be momentarily proven right.
You want to push btc off a cliff to satisfy some short-sighted alts greed, not realizing you’re chained to btc and will fall with it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMGGGGGGG
I don't think its dead, but its risky to buy at all right now.
The slope is a downward slope.
Until we get some steady upward slope, I wouldn't put a penny into it.Also, I predicted this.
Good news about BTC makes its price crawl up, slowly, by a couple of hundred.
Bad news causes a chain-reaction of selling which is going on now.
I would't be surprised if the chain reaction brings it to 4K or lower.
BTC is dead.
BCH will take the throne.
BTC will hit 8k before eoy
Bitcoin is like a performer balancing a stack of plates.
The higher it gets, the more likely it will fall over.
What happened?
Brainlets on /biz/ will think its due to BCH but its really due to tax reform shit going on
lol remember that time BTC hit ATH of 4900 then china banned bitcoin (again) and it went all the way down to 3300?
what
 tax reform shit going onsource?
When a popular restaurant changes managers and staff is it suddenly dead?
Maybe some old stubborn regulars will fud the new setup but who cares, plenty of new customers to replace them.
