DAMN QTUM is undervalued

What's the circulating supply?
Max supply?
1 billion total tokens..Circulating supply is either 178.5m or 500mThey made this update before the ICO after BTC price went from $5-6k to $7-8k:"Due to the surge of BTC price in the recent month, we have made adjustment for BTC to Ink exchange rate in the white paper for the Crowd-sale.
This will ensure fairness when using different types of tokens to invest.
Details of the adjustment are as below."
Devs mentioned that a ''mysterious" exchange will list INK on the 25th
binance pls
Now I'm confused.Theres another INK ICO coming within a month.
They cant both be called INK tho right?
What's with this gay screenshot?
Thanks, too many unknown variables.
The INK ICO was last week, Ink Labs Foundation is registered in Singapore which is also where their offices are.
There is no other INK token.http://ink.one
