who /g88/ here?
When is the ICO?
Been trading cryptos for about a year and a half, never bothered with the ASX, but my dad trades it and I wouldn't mind getting in.Any starting guides or anything like that?
Damn haven't been in an asx thread for ages!Actually I haven't been on 4chan for ages!I'm the guy who put everything he had into MLS.Still holding it.Things are starting to look promising.
Even if it doesn't go back to what I bought at, I've finally come to terms with the fact that I may never get my money back
Im the guy who put money into NUH and RMX.
I cashed out in the negative too long ago.
Shouldve put it into A2M when it was $1.30.
Still salty over that one
I like food/produce stuff right now.
As the Aussie economy transitions out of the mining boom and the dollar dropped it became far easier to sell our stuff to Asia.
Any AGY holders besides myself here?
How do you'll pass time till it's fucking March?
Kek.
None of you are going to talk about MEI and the opportunity to 100x your money when electric cars are manufactured worldwide?
Alright then.
If you can trade crypto you can trade the ASX.
Same concept just wayyyyy less price movement.Use a platform like nabtrade or commsec.
Nab is cheaper but commsec has better features.
You'll be paying at least $15 per trade tho lelRobinhood is coming to Aus soon tho with free trades so maybe wait for that Personally I'm bagholding RGS and MSBLife is suffering with these biotech stocks
Im still a pink wojak MLS and GMC holder down 45%GMC just pumped to 2.2 recently but I bought into MLS at 1.1Im holding longterm, fuck it.
I've finally learned to hodl the old man stocks for once.
ASX is a LOT slower than crypto, but also less volatile.
Think crypto time from x10.
So the movement you see in crypto takes 10x longer in old man stocks.Same concepts apply.
Parabolic pumps are met with 90% retraces etc
