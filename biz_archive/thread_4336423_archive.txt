Ever gonna recover?
is there a reason it dumped so hard?
It didn't dump, it was overhyped for a moment and now is waiting for exchange volume to go up.
When it does, it will explode.
Don't get your hopes up too much.
I've got over 5k COSS and I'm not selling, but it ain't looking good.
Give it time.
They'll be upgrading the UI on the short term.
Remember - it only needs a relatively small increase in trading volume to moon and it's still a new exchange
Hello i am Rune
Coss is a scam.
1 year in production and they deliver a shit exchange.
Remember this incompetent business man rune has leaded veros also in a shit hole.
Coss is veros 2.0
here's a tip: fucking wait10x gains never happen overnight
I hope so, they have been dragging the UI changes for a while now and it looks like it'll stay like that for a few months.
