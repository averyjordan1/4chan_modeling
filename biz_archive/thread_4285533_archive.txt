Buy more bitcoin now or wait till it crashes harder?
I think there is more room downwards, where do you see the price heading the next few days/weeks?
about $80 a bitcoin.
$3k bottomamazing how quickly people forget in crypto, might go lower than that
it's going all the way to somewhere between $0 and $8500
$5700 bottom in 4-7 days
Do the opposite of what people suggest here and you should be fine.
BTC will be abandoned in 3 months unless $100 transactions worth it with fees
please dont post this pepe
quads confirm
>coin is decreasing in value by hundreds hourly>should I buy now?
