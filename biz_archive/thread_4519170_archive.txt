Am I getting this right?
It seems virtually every exchange trades altcoins exclusively for other cryptos, of which BTC and ETH are ubiquitous among trading pairs, though LTC seems to be common too.
These coins can be bought with fiat.
For someone starting out in the world of cryptos, is it correct that these coins are prerequisites for getting into other altcoins?
pretty much yes...In other news you can't buy Bitcoin Cash for Cash eitherYet in just 24 hours it will somehow usurp BTC
(((they))) won't tell you about Bitstamp and kraken anon
dunno about bitstamp, but kraken does not have that many alt coins.
it is good enough to start with though, i guess
