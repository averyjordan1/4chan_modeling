Whatâ€™s the best place to purchase Alt-coins?
coinbase
bittrex/binance
Most new alts get listed on Ether Delta first and if you learn to use that piece of shit you're set for all exchanges.
If you want alts that already pumped and dumped then binance has most ETH/shitcoin pairs.
First time I used PajeetDelta was to buy LINK in September, gotten used to it since.
Buy ETH on coinbase, make a MyEtherWallet to put it in and then send to Binance/EtherDelta

I have ETH and BTC on my coinbase but I want all my coins in one place, how do I do this.
Preferably somewhere secure like coinbase is.
Why would you want altcoins...
Oh linkies.
What would the world of cryptocurrencies be without you?
What do, we owe the honour.
The promise of Link seemed glimmering at first.
The premise of 'rent free' was surely innovative and ahead of its time.
But, as time showed us, this coin was nothing more than a pump and dump that inadvertently created the most deranged community of bag holders known to man.
A community that incessantly screeches "rent free" whenever they feel threatened, which is very common.
To be a linkie is to be deranged.
Having lost everything, whether it be your house, marriage, wife's sons college money or life-savings surely takes a toll on the mental serenity of a linkie's mind.
Slight threats critiquing the developers of Chainlink sets the common linkie into a state of neurosis that can only be cured by euthanasia or the eventual revaluing of this godforsaken currency.
However, once the price reaches 10 cents, the value will continue falling.
This crash will be catalyzed by the fact that thousands of wallets will be lost as a mass suicide of linkies, causing the price to dip even faster than Sergey can yell "POP OFF ME LEGS" at the Mayo Clinic.
Don't be deranged, don't be a linkie.
Dont leave your stuff on an exchange, ever.Put it into wallets.
Either MEW or paper
