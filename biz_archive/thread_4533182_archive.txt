Bittrex lists BTC-USD volume at $39921113.59, and BCC-USD volume at $47243660.09.
What does the fact that BCC has a higher volume by 7M (18%) mean?
Should I buy?
It means people are cashing out of BTC to FOMO in BCC.That's it.
Whether you want to buy because of that, only your retard mind would know
That doesn't make sense, as you'd see high volume in the BTC-BCH pair, not BCH-USD volume exceeding BTC-USD.Fact that there's higher volume in the BCH-USD pair means fiat is pouring directly into BCH at a far greater rate than BCH.
This is a necessary precursor to the flippening, though by no means a guarantee.You should buy Bitcoin Cash if you think it's going to continue to gain exchange support, hashpower.and greater software support in the community.
Most of the BCH volume comes from Korea.
Interesting.
Why is that?
I don't know.
A lot of pumps (Dash, monero, ether) start with Bithumb.https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/#markets
