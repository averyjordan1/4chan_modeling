People laughed at me when I said bch would stop bleeding and start pumping once it hits 0.1 which is where the huge wall is.It's about to hit 0.10 now... use this thread to apologize.
See ya at 0.06
roger going to pull out ,100%
lmao..... good luck bro.
seriously.
That's not how walls workIf he removes the wall his literally risking the future of the entire bch project
% sure the wall will disappear.
He's right buy the dip.
Who gives a fuck about the faggot coin money is blind and people are kikes.
Not yet just wait until it bleeds all the way down to 0.100.
It's at 0.109 or something now
Apologize to money, why do you hate it?
