What bank/country should I park my money if I wanted to make sure noone but me will ever touch it?
Hypothetical question.
Set up a shell business in the Caribbean.
Whatever country is famous for tax havens.
Send all your btc there.
Cash out.
This only makes sense if you're trying to hide millions.
No one cares about your neetbux.
Keep those under your mattress.
Yeah I'm looking for concrete countries/banks.
