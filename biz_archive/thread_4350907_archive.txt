Already in anonand it feels so good
Holy fuck its actually happening
WTC on COSS?
We need a real exchange not this low volume piece of shit.
happeningcrowd funding and exclusive ICO'sWe gonna make it brahsbe happy dumbass, coss is a massive warchest just waiting to be opened
wow they are launching ico through coss and plan to begin upgrading the ui in two weeks?
thank god, coss is my only bag.
How about you fuck off.
WTC desperately needs to list on an exchange where it will actually pick up traction and coss is just another shithole where it'll do under 10k daily volume.
4351142there is nothing you can do to stop itit's the future you chose
D-did you really just mashup flashwave, coss, and walton?
COSS is going to be one of those coins that is going to keep climbing as soon as they revamp the UI and add fiat trading.
As volumes grow, the token value will grow, which will cause the volume to grow even more as it gains traction.
I'm super excited for this coin.
my sweet summer child.
