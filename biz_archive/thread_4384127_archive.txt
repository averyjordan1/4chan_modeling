BTC: +$701.89 since yesterday...Is this normal?
Won't the market correct and take some of this back?
considering its stealing all the market from bch which stole it from them its pretty much consolidating now.
so basically now's the time to buy.
But my gut tells me there's a dip
I told you retards to buy at $6.500.
You called me a fag.
Now I'm Jew-rich you motherfuckers.
Bank jews proping it up so they get the futures bs approved
what happens after futures are approved?
lowers and stabilizes?
You missed the dip silly.
Probably shorted to hell and it crashes 50%
No, I bought in at 6.5k and again at 5.7kI just think that 700 is really fast, but I didn't take into account what this anon said 
Rich normies are seriously getting into this, i know a certain Chinese family in NYC that owns and rents out around 5% of the real estate in Manhattan and Newark, there all buying $10k of BTC and ETH daily, thorugh Coinbase ofcourse lol.
