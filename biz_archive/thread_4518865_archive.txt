Why weren't you accumulating eth tell now?
Eth has had many dips that were sub 300 by a lot.
Yet you all wrote it off.
Because Eth is an inflationary coin prone to hacking with a Pedo developer.
No thanks
>tfw should have done nothing but hold me ethMy very first crypto buy was ETH at $65, sold at 200 and bought back in at 300 last week or so
the future
inflationarylike 0.1% per year, less than the amount of ETH lost
accumulated 50. putting 15k in seemed like alot
bitcoin has 4% inflation retards
no
