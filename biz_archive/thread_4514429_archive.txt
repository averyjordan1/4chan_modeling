GVT my dude.
Look at it.
Make your moves.
This is going to fucking blow up in the next 5 days.
Checked.
Why Bitcoin Gold?
have some from the fork.
Thinking of buying more.
What is the recommended buy?
1/3 BTC, 1/3 ETH, 1/3 XMR.This isn't hard.Look at the chart a year ago.
If you just put money into the top 10 coins you got something back like 5000% percent return.
It's a bit later in the bubble but still pretty early IMO that you should at least get 10x.
The normies are coming in 2018.
Don't be a fat hog that gets slaughtered by chasing shitcoins when you have 25k to play with.

In case you're not trolling and are being the product of that 3rd world madrasah education you Europeans receive, doubling it 5 times is the same thing as 25,000 * (2^5) or x32
