I just got laid off, and I'm really fucking tired of wagecucking.How do I use the government to help me pay for shit while I study?
Just need basic stuff like food/gas/phone bill
yeah you can fuck right off faggot, stop being a leech to society.
Unemployment, then there's a million assistance programs for electric heat water etcc not sure if u need to apply for welfare to get them, if your poor on paper you can get pell grants for school.
4479200Go for assistance.
You should get Food stamps/EBT, Possibly housing voucher, but that will require moving.
Unemployment:Pertaining to your previous length of employment SS pays for a certain amount of months unemployed, maybe six months.
This might require taking work classes at Goodwill or someplace.Unemployment besides SS might be available to you.I recommend doing this and then being paid in cash by working for people you know, finding a small business, getting contracts, or panhandling (must be a certain caliber of degenerate).
I know it seems bad, but I saw a documentary on opiate addicts in Canada.
These were kids in their late teens.
They would ask for money outside of businesses, obviously strung out on drugs.
They were so young and humble that people would give them something.
Then again it is Canada, not US.The point is during the video, one of the kids estimates the amount of drugs he takes each day, and it totals more than $400,000(again, Canadian) in one year.
He had gathered that much money panhandling every day, and he spent everything that day.
Really gargles my almonds
You're the faggot.
Never say no to free money OP.
