nah bro I'm good, I read Satoshi's whitepaper
Satoshis vision was not 8mb blocks bro.
He didnt want to cap blocks at all, only did that to prevent spam when btc was practically free.
How ever that is problematic since if there is no block sizecap, there is no tsfees, spam becames almost free and size of btc blockchain might explode to sizes where home miners couldnt buy enough harddrives for cheap enough to keep mining.
Looks like you didnt read the whitepaper after all, you just claim to have read it.
And do you really think satoshis original version was good enough for mainstream?
Nigga plzIts computer software that can be updated.
are you one single pajeet who keeps reposting this screencap everywhere (including on twitter strangely enough) or is core paying an entire team of you?
pathetic either way
I'm sure the guy who invented the first computer just had ALL the ideas and a clear vision without fault.
Totally.
core doesnt pay us.
we do it for free nigger.
we will never back down from you.
