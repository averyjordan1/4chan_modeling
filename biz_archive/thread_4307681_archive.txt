How do I get better at making videos and, in turn, more money.
>youtube in 2017Lul, enjoy that retarded over saturation and demonetization.
What's the next long jew I need to look into?
be harder on yourself, if you don't think somethings right, others will critiuqe it.if you're aiming for a specific niche, wether it's lets playing or unboxing, make sure your content is both informative, but entertaining, sure it's funny to see some guys fucking around with their mates like maxmoefoe and idubbbz, there videos only cater to that niche, but they also do it exceptionally well.
TL;DR : Your content is only as good as you genuinly believeTry to do whatever you're doing better than othersoh and you only have 15s to grab the attention of the average youtuber, so gl.if you upload regularly and you see about a 5% growth each week, expect to be famour in 4 years.
Pro tip, you won't go viral.
Today I tried to upload my first dtube video.
It's this one: https://d.tube/v/someonelse/oky3hizfI have no idea how to get traffic to it though.
But dtube has a lot of potential since it's not nearly as saturated as youtube
