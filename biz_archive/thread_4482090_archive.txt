Long position on IOP.

The Internet of People (IoP) is a complete infrastructure for apps and payments that is not server based.
Instead, it is completely decentralized and based on nodes.
Those nodes could run on home computers or even smaller devices like a Raspberry Pi (fully) or smartphone (in part).The IoP token is a currency that is used for payments on the IoP.
It also grants holders a share in the Internet of People as a decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO).Bluepaper and roadmap is coming in 1 day 10 hours.
I bought some yesterday at 33350sats.
In your opinion, how the bluepaper release will influence the prices ?
How long before reaching the first target?
My bet it will reach the first target in couple days .
IMHO after release of bluepaper and roadmap project will attract many investors.
More news coming on 4/5 december at "Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conferemce".Just hold your investment , definetly you will not regret.
I hope it will be as much insane as it was in october.
