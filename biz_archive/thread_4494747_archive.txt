When TRIG pumps, it pumps hard
weird coin.
i just read up on it.
using blockchain technology and smart contracts to make firearms more safe?
like how?
do they have a working product theyve demoed?
Confirmed scam coin three months ago.
I guess the devs wants to sell the fake news and dump the rest of their shitcoins.
I agree.
It pumped to 20k sats after the cnbc thing following the vegas shooting.
and that wasn't even anything real.
this upcoming conference is going to solidify partnerships with NASA and lockheed martin.
they're product is so different from the rest of the crypto space too.
This is a guaranteed pump like we haven't seen in a while and we still have days to go.if the upcoming partnerships with NASA and Lockheed are any good, we'll be seeing a fucking rocket
