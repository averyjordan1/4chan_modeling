Why would the upcoming difficulty adjustment be profitable for Bitcoin Cash?
Now that BCH adjusts difficulty each block wouldn't BTC become profitable again pretty quickly?That's what i've heard people saying anyway.
Is this true?
Donâ€™t overthink it just ride the PnD like the last week anon

Uh, I don't think it's about out profiting anymore.
I think the point is to make an attempt at literal chain death.
