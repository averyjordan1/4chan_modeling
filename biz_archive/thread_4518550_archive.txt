Bitcoin is going up, 30% in the last 24 hours.You didn't fall for the Bitcoin CORE meme now, did you anon?
bcash pump and dump bs
Haha, this shit is bouncing around in a range tighter than a 13 year old Chinese nun's asshole, and you're freaking out.This is a short break that will be good to keep $8,2-- from burning into everybody's monitor.Don't worry, it'll be $8,250 again shortly.Of course, the plunge to upper $6Ks is coming very soon.
You think you're Wojacking now...
You're not supposed to take the buy high sell low meme literally...
Ugh.
I hope some asshole is paying you dirty parasites to spout bullshit like this, because otherwise it's inexcusable.
Unless of course you're holding BCH bags and trying to shill them in your own self interest, in which case lol get rekt retard
Except it's not dumping.
>$150>pink wojaks over less than 2% swingsfucking lmao this is low volatility for a crypto, if you want stable go trade index funds because crypto clearly isn't for you
