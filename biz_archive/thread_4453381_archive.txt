Hi this is the kraken support of kraken.com!
Ask any questions here and please provide your account ID for reference.
Like all companies, we host our support chat on the /biz/ board of 4chan!First off---please cut off your balls and post a picture to confirm you are a human and not a bot.
They have an active community manager in reddit, contact him and reopen a support ticket.
