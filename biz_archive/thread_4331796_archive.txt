Who here /embarrassed/ to be invested in bitcoin?When I tell people about it they just say>haha oh yeah bitcoin.
I see that shit everywhere, on tv, the news, everything, its so annoyingFUCK
I don't feel embarrassed and I don't bring it up constantly because I have other things going on in my life.
>Haha I hear about Bitcoin on Facebook and TV all the time it's so annoying omg>Yeah, it's really crazy but I enjoy it>conversation shifts into a different topic
Not really the point....
telling people about it irlDude they'll know when you get fucking rich.
They'll try to leech off you and ask you for crypto advice and some might try to steal it from you.
At worst they will be a nuisance.
Never tell people about your crypto.
Why tell them that?
Instead, tell them you are developing in solidity to create smart contracts for the ethereum blockchain.
They will instantly think your a genius, even though you are just a bullshitter
no, that is the point you socially inept retardits nothing to whine about like a little cocksucking bitch, dont bring it up in the first place if you don't expect dissenting opinions you pussy bitchthe fuck you expect, every stacy and chad to come and blow your dick when they find out "oh my god!!
