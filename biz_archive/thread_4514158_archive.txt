Holy fuck you actually held past $5 in gains?
Most biztards would have cashed out of crypto completely by then.
Good job kid.
HODL.P.s.
If you make $15 or more, do push it any further and GTFO.
Be humble at $6 gains friend.
If I make over 100 I'll be sure to reward my fellow biznessmen.Hodl ftw my man, it's the only way to make mad gainz

Your gonna hate your life even more every day you wake up and take the bus to your mcdonalds job knowing you sold 2k LINK for 0.22 when its worth $40> We live rent free inside your head
Sergey is alternating between eating Big Macs and snorting cocaine off of black BBW booty cheeks while Rory is furiously stroking his pencil dick in the corner with one hand and stonewalling investors in the slack with the other.
That’s why all his “updates” trying to hide the fact that this project is a complete debacle are riddled with typos.
A pile of unread resumes sit on the floor, drenched in Big Mac sauce.
Steve is the only one trying.
He’s locked away in his moms basement trying to learn GO.
It’s such an obscure and asinine language that he can’t find the documentation he needs.
He’s about to snap.
He keeps frantically calling Sergey.
Sergey only texts back, “new phone, who dis” and “32 million solves my oracle problem.” Steve’ mom’s basement reeks of the marijuana Steve smokes to cope with the stress.
A thick haze from all the smoke lingers.
All Steve can see are two faint lights.
One is the blue light emitting from his shitty 2010 dell inspiron laptop.
Somehow Sergey didn’t think they’d have money in the budget for him to get a new laptop.
The other is the glimmer of steel of his colt 45 revolver with his one way ticket out of his hell.
