NEO GOT Y'ALL
Seriously...
The news was just the dev competition that we already knew about from a leak but this was the "official" announcement.
On top of that it's bullshit because Microsoft does literally thousand's of these co-hosted competitions a year with other companies.
Hell, my college even did one with them.
They will go anywhere where they can scalp talent as long as they don't have to pay for the setup or venue.
It's all garbage... At least the price is still up and I was able to get the fuck out in time.
People forgot about the original antshares run up because of a “Microsoft partnership”
