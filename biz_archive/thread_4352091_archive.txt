4352178Why do you biztards all FOMO in chasing highs and then not sell when you are into heavy profit.
And since you didn't actually believe in BCH you just wanted to chase highs now you are panicking.It is your own fault you lost money and if you actually believed in the future of BCH you wouldn't be shitting your pants because it is down in the short term.
You fucks are the reason we have crazy pumps followed by crazy dumps.
the price dropped by 50% in the space of literally 10 minutes after taking 5-6 hours to get to ath, everyone expected a crash but nowhere near as quick as it did.
Because I wasn't into heavy profit
