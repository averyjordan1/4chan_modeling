buy now don miss the boat
What will this mean for price?
I've got a bunch of Link on Binance doing shit all?
Should I move it?
no this is a pnd.
its already way over bought.
Sooo many confido and salt shills lately.
PLEASE, you are overdoing it and putting people off, just like WTC back in august.
>>The difference between salt and confido is one is at $150 million marketcap and the other is at $5 million market cap and partnering with LINK... easy choice
Not even close the same.
LoLConfido is completly overvalued, hope everyone jumps the shit at the right time - don't want the full board with pink wojacks again.
I can't really wait to see the guys in 2 weeks that are actually fucking buying into 14x ICO price 2 days after release LOL
