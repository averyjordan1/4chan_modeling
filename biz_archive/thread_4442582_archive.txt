please god I need Neo to do well
been trying to send my RPX out of my NEO wallet so I can swap back over to NEO.
Wallet was synced.
Got an "invalid transaction" and now my RPX isn't showing up in my NEO wallet or on my Kucoin wallet, where I tried to send it.
Am I fucked?
Nevermind this post.
literally just went through to Kucoin.
Had me fucking sweating.
