Why has this fallen so much?
Was it a Pnd or is it a legit project?
I don't know but I went from a smug pepe to a JUSTED wojack real quick with this one.
thought I was golden with my 70 cents entry point.
most altcoins have fallen since this btc bullrun you faggot, this one isn't an exception
This face does not fill me with confidence
Go learn how markets work you stupid fucks
Heading back to ICO price around 4 cents.
Buy back at $0.25
Of course it's a PnD shitcoin.
LMAO @ anyone who bought this above ICO.In truth, buying this coin was always a dumb idea, even at ICO.
It's kind of like trying to rob a bank.
Sure, there's an off chance you'll get away with it, and those who got in early are basically the robbers who got lucky.
But it was still a dumb idea to begin with.
And now that the hype is over, I see a LOT of JUSTed pink wojacks in this coin's future.Enjoy your bags retards.
nice b8 m8
Doesn't really matter.
There are other projects like EOS that still rise.
CFD has such a low market cap.
that this will rise for sure.
Price manipulation for new exchanges
Initial hype pumps the price, it is going to stay down until Confido starts delivering.
