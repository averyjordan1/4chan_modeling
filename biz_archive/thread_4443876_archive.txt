Hey /biz/.
Selling a few of my most valuable comics as I think they’ve gone up as much in value as they’re going to in the short term and crypto is hopefully in the infancy of a huge booming economic model.
I think I’m gonna get around 3k for them.
Should I buy up to one full BTC, more ETH, more LINK, more NEO, more OMG, or something else?
Also hodling some shitcoins in the form of XML, COSS, ODN, XVG.
Looking for 3 to 5x gains over 2-5 years so not day trading with this money for the most part.
What say you.
Best answer get’s ex-gf nudes.
bumping so anons will answer.
