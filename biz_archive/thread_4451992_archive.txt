#1 (BTC) to #15 (Monero) are all in the top 100 on CMC.The Marketcap of Nuls is 33'228'80, so around #124 on CMC.A lot of people see potential in this token.What do you think about it?Tell me a reason why you did or didn't buy atleast 50 of those.
For me it's worth a try.
!!!IMPORTANT!!
!This isn't the true market cap.
The circulating supply isn't known.
I just calculated this market cap with the MAX SUPPLY!!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Ah, come on, no one here wanna talk about $NULS?This is a good Token!
I bought 5.5k worth when it first pumped cos I was drunk.
Hopefully it does something.
Early FUD was 'empty github' and 'noone knows who devs are' and both points answered now.
Fuck knows really.
If it were to go about +30% from where it is now I'd sell half for BTC to hold and keep the other half in case NULS turns out to be in ETP or even NEO vein.
community members are pretty responsive, they have a new website coming out this week
The volume is all wash trading on the BNB pair retard
