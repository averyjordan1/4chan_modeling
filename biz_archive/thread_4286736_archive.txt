Dark Synthwave.Perturbator, Carpenter Brut, Kick-Puncher.
Not only is it awesome but that 80's aesthetic brings back the hyper capitalist Wall Street trading days from the 1980's.
Perfect for trading.

Admit you listen to this for the piano bits at 1:20 and 3:38.
CatchyI feel like I missed out on great nostalgia by not owning this game.
Fucking choon ladBy far most autistic song in this thread so far.
The measure of autism being directly proportional to how embarrassed you'd be if one of your parents suddenly walked in and witnessed you actively listening to this.
Not that it's unenjoyable to listen to.
Pretty upbeat.Not going to listen to the whole thing because it's super long.
Rating: Not autistic enough.
However this nigger music is kind of comfy because it reminds me of GTA San Andreas when Radio Los Santos would be onPokemon is a staple autistic genre of music.
I unironically know the names of all the kanto tracks, and even most of the indigo league anime track names (that are all uploaded by Merhawk102).
I admit I'll listen to Pokemon Red Champion Battle vs. Blue when I want to do something super-focused.
Don't know this game anyways, but this sounds comfyI will say that this is at least better than the AIDS N-Gin theme, but it's no Cortex theme (Crash 3: Warped)
