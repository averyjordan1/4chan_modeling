I just threw .25BTC into a Binance account to learn trading.
I'm down to .239BTC.How do trade?
What resources should I study, what news feeds should I keep an eye on?
bonk
Chase moons, flip recently added shitcoins
Buy dips and only dips
what coins can i count on bouncing back?
Is the ETH dip worth snatching up?
What about BCC?
Is now a good time to get in?
I'm just looking to flip for maybe 6% gains as quick as possible.
