If BTC dies out, BCH will no doubt be called Bitcoin and also have Bitcoin's logo.

The Koreans always have been on the side of BCH.
Before the Chinese market closings, the Chinese were the biggest buyers of BTC in the world.
wow, you're being played.This has happened before, and it will happen again.The difficulty correction was just not enough to make BCH profitable to mine, so "suddenly" there is a bump in the price.
Now BCH is profitable to mine.Who wins?
Jihan Wu wins.He's chinese, but he can't be buying all of the BCH from china, so he uses south korean exchanges.Like 90% of the price bump comes from one exchange (he doesn't even try to hide it)It's also kept standing just because of one mysterious miner who won't stop mining it even when it's terribly unprofitable.You're being played, open your eyes.
Take your profits (if you made any) and dump as quickly as you can
