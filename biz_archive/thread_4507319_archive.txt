Remember, /biz/, if you want the easiest 4x gains you ever got in Dec, buy SALT.
Don’t say I never warned you.
Up up and away

4507319If I take a loan for $25,000 with my 3 bitcoins, and the price of Bitcoin drops 50% what happens?Do I get liquidated?
Wow, I'm not giving a cent to that guy.
Just listen to him for a minute, man.
Yeah.
Hope flippening finishes before salt hits and they add more collateral choices at launch, as well as higher minimum collateral margins than a measly 25%.
It's crypto after all.
Extremely volatile, even btc nowadays.
Bitfinex and bitcoin ect about to shit everywhere too.It was a good idea but salt isn't taking the possibility of crypto not being perpetual bull seriously enough.

You have some amount of time to replenish the collateral with more bitcoin or fiat but if you didn’t they’d liquidate 2 BTC in your example to put the ratio of collateral to loan back to 125%.
That’s why you’d only want to put 2 if your bitcoins up as collateral so you still have something else to put in if the value drops.
This coin will be sleeping till mid december
On the 28th they have a conference, buy the rumor...
Dark blue and green lambo would look awesome
