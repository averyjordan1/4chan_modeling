Which one of you does this belong to???
I wish I was a whale with a shitload of BCH in profit atm.I'd love to just fill that whales order right fucking now and watch him get stuck with million dollar bags
So what?
700 BCH is like 150 BTC.
It's not like we haven't seen 1000 BTC walls on finex
Who do you think would really prop up that overpriced scamcoin?
that 700 represents 700 btc
i could retire 3x over with thatfuuuck
Take a look at the BCH wall at 0.1
