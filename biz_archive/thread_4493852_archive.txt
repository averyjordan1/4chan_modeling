but i bought in at 8500 sats so i'm still at massive loss LOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOL
You did good buying high(and selling low soon), anon.
I sold 7k at 4300 to buy neo because i thought the "news" was going to make it moon harder itll hit $1 by eow easily
Don't even worry about it, this is going to be a few days of mooning and dipping.
Just hold, 8500 was a bad buy in but definitely not catastrophic.
