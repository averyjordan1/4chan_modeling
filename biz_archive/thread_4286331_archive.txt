Tell me?
Hold both.
Always.
ETH Parity wallet just got hacked.....DO NOT buy...$178 million of wallets locked....unable to withdraw because of idiots at Parity....ETH is a SCAM....buy BCH it's about to flip and become core Bitcoin.
I would buy bch
Buy ETH if you want a coin that's $300.
No more, no less.
Lots of token frozen means it's scarcer and the rest now more valuable.
It's a safer option, yes.
ETH is very stable to USD.
NOT IF UR WALLET GETS LOCKED NEXT.
Seriously...what kind of logic is this?
It's multisig wallets only ...Where's your logic ?
ETH is going to get regulated quick with their unregulated ICOs...
EVEN worse...meaning if one person fucks up...the whole wallet is fucked
At least it will bump the price up.
With EEA it was only a matter of time anyway.
