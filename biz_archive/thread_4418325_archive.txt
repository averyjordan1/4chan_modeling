REEEEEEEE I REALLY NEED TO WITHDRAW SOME MONEY AND THIS FUCKING CHINKS ARE OBLIGATING ME TO USE THE 2FA TO DO SO.
SO I TRY TO ENABLE IT BUT ALL IT SAYS IS "BINDING FAILED" >"BINDING FAILED""BINDING FAILED">"BINDING FAILED""BINDING FAILED"HELP
Which app?
Try Authy or LastPass Authenticator.
Had the same problem.
Send an email an request to reset the 2fa and then enable it
"liquidity"
Oh, you can use Authy with this?
I'll try itI got an email from support and it says: >(1),Download an authenticator app , click "add an account" and choose "Manually add account " with filling in your binance account name in the form.>(2).Copy your key (2FA backup key ) from binance web page and fill it in the form of "enter your key " on the app .>(3).Fill in your password in the "Enter login password"form ,please double check if there is a capital letter in your password.>(4).Enter your authentication code in the form of "Enter 2FA code from the app".>(5).Please make sure your phone time is the same as the Binance website timeLike if it isn't what I just did
Also had that reply but I then specifically requested to reset and send me a new code.
So had to post 3 selfies and such and then it worked
GOD BLESS YOU ANON I USED AUTHY AND IT WORKED AT THE FIRST TRY YEAAAAAAAAH BOYYYYYYYYYYYYY
which one has worked?
