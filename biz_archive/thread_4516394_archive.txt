So I mostly use binance because I like their interface and it's the first one I started using, so simply stuck with it.
Lots of coins aren't listed on it though.... XLM, SYS, etc.
Should I open a bittrex account as well?
What are the cons to them?
>since the bch moon nothing has fucking worked, shit just won't load properly>slow support>us based>closes wallets every fucking time a coin moons>probably manipulating coinsanyway I use it along with binance
this, also>very high withdrawal fees>slow account verification processI used it once to trade for VTC, but I use Binance for almost everything else.
Bitfinex is the best if you're not American.
