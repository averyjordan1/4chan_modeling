When will this shit fucking moon
Last summer
Never ever
Remember when this coin was around 400 and 500k amd was mooning like every other day?
Lol.
Man how times have changed
JUST MOON GOD DAMN IT
DELET THIS
This shit went like 1000x already
fell most of that, no reason why it shouldnt go up
poomp incomig, adjust your seat belts
this coin is heading straight to zero.
Never have I ever been so happy to have sold at a loss.
Considering it dumped almost 75% from my entry.
Fuck Stratis and their shit wallet.
can you say FUD
This is going to moon like crazy in december, just look at the meme triangles.In all seriousness though, I can see this going back to the all time high by end of december if the team meets its deadlines (Chris said in the AMA that they were ahead and some projects may be released early).
They are almost ready to launch ICO's and apparently have clients ready (this is all meant to be happening in December).
Do they have more clients than a goddamn fish startup?
They haven't disclosed details on any of their clients.
Check out the AMA though if interested though.
They exist since 2014 and dont have a working product ^^ just a weak ass scammer companyAfter every pump, coins disapear from their wallet.That means they release weak news to dump on you guys their own coins.Fuck that shit.Thats digibyte with better marketing ,,,
The fuck are you talking about, the ICO was in 2016 right?
I guess we'll see if t hey deliver their 'working product' in december like they claim to.
yes there is a reason faggot it's called early adopters dumping their staked coins on you day in and day out to divest into other things and fiateventually it will reach an equilibrium if you faggots don't give up lel but it depends on how much the collective buying power is willing to spend
