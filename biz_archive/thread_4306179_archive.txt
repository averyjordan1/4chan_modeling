Anybody know whats going on with rlc.
over 2mill volume increase.
could this be the pump weve been waiting for?
people parking their gains
pajeet micro penis pnd most likely
Maybe it's insider buying
Hey biz, 53cents for a tech that will ultimately power half the internet and be valued at over $300.
Should I get some or stay poor?
this is most def a steal
Thank you for bringing it to my attention.
After holding RLC bags for two months I finally decided to sell temporarily to stay out of BTC-BCH market volatility.
I'd probably kill myself if it mooned while I was out of it
5$ when?
