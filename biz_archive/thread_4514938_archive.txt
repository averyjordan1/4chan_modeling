Christ this is more complicated than it needs to beI make money through Amazon affiliates, but a significant portion of my traffic comes from India.
I want to monetize the Indian traffic, but you can't sign up for Amazon's India affiliate program unless you have a bank account in India.
You can't open a bank account in India unless you are Indian, or if you're a tourist you can open a temporary account for up to 6 months, and then repatriating money out of it is stupidly complicated.How do I, an American, go about opening a bank account in India?
Surely I could pay someone to be my agent and give them power of attorney over the account, have them take 5-10% of income and then send the rest to me every month.
But how the fuck do I find out how to do that?
Who do I even talk to?
