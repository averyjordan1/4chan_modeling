Dat ass
Well, we're running an ICO.
Basically it's about fund raising using crypto to pad the assets of companies, so they're worth more come their IPOs in their respective stock exchanges.One year after the IPO, we buyback and burn ALL the coins, at a 33% premium.You want in?
Our ICO isn't so impressive though, since this is my (and our) first time running one.

It's decentralised filesharing (torrenting, essentially) where you are rewarded for hosting data.May or may not be big long-term, but it's certainly solid enough to trade above ICO value short-term.
Good whitepaper, too.
Biggest question marks for me at the moment is the lack of details of the background of the team.

I don't think so.
Did my research.
We made extra sure we aren't an investment, nor a share in a company.
