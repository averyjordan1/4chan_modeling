After hearing the news about LINK today, I'm considering making ARK my next investment instead.
What do you guys think about this?
We're only talking about a few hundred dollars here.
You get dividends, though they will be negligible if you only have ~100 ark.
Mobile wallet is in the pipeline for it, and there haven't been too many huge swings as I think there are quite a few staking hodlers.
Does it really have a use though?Look into biz_classic and the voting system, read up, decide based on that.
About a third of my portfolio is ark.
