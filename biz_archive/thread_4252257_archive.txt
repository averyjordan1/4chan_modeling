means bch is our only hope now, unless you look forward to $10 fees
I thought we were at $7 already.
Soon we will be at $50
Holy fuck there are still retarded people like you.This whole debate is about scaling bitcoin.OKHow do we scale it?LET'S DOUBLE IT!sure, that will make it go from 3 transactions per second to 6.
WOW!Not really, not a big fucking deal.Did it solve confirmation times?no?
still 10 minutes per block?
oopsWe need to make it go up to visa levels.The only way to do this (thousands of tx per second) is using LN.
Not only it will allow thousands of tx per second, it will also allow INSTANT confirmations.Meanwhile the blockchain will still stay there for legacy retards like you.fees depend entirely on how fast you want your transaction to confirm, and most wallets do terribly at calculating a decent fee
It means miners want to completely switch to Bitcoin Cash, ViaBTC, BTC.TOP, Bitcoin.com, antpool and a heap of smaller miners support Bitcoin Cash.
Those miners above represent a huge percentage of overall hashing power.
Bitcoin Cash is a grossly undervalued monster.
