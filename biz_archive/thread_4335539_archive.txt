any "invest" in steam game skins here?
*anyone
too risky, it takes one steam update to make some aspect of selling trading etc vastly different and maybe even 100% no longer profitable.
Its not ideal.
Crypto atleast is made explicitly as currency therefore you theoretically can make or lose money on it always.
