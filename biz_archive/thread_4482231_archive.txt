Agree completely.Accumulating now before it gets announced, because once it does it'll be fucked.
Buy LOW.
Sell HIGH.
Thank you OP, don`t want to use fucking bitfinex.
People starting to complain that they can not withdraw btc and other alts from the exchange.
I managed to get out my btc from there yesterday like a charn

My btc withdrawal is still "processing".
Fuck you Bitfinex you useless cunts

This should be at least 15$...I've never seen such hardcore accumulation and support on any coin.
I think there will be something big soon.
