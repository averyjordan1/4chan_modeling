i cant help you if you cant understand the tech ... do your research and you'll figure out!
What is number 1 going to be?
ARK obv
bitcoin will stay for a while ...
centralized shit
A while...
The whole 2018, you reckon?
yea 2018 for sure ... could change in 2019 ... but bitcoin could also be n1 in 2023 ... who knows ... but i think whole ecosystems like ethereum, iota, neo, whatever go stronger and stronger ... but blockchains first have to fix their scalability, miner (getting more and more centralized), fee problem ... just my guess
you are definitly a retard ;) ... sorry, cant help you ... go for mooncoin then ;) ;) ;)
