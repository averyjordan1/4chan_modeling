Hi /biz/, never posted here before.I'm not a trader or investor, complete newfag.
I just saw three bitcoin documentaries in a row and it made me want to make a babbies first investment of £100 to bitcoin.How the fuck do I go about it?
Can I just straight up convert like I would with any currency?Also, side note but related to Bitcoin, is this shit a scam?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCHcvtI0w0A&feature=youtu.beMy uncle keeps on sending me it trying to get me to buy in but fuck me it screams pyramid scheme.
What's your verdict?> inb4 bait> inb4 lurk moreI'm a fucking dumb-dumb.Help a new boy out.
bitcoin itself is essentially an internet accelerated pyramid scheme.
you can have some fun with it but it's basically gambling
one click on that video preview and I already know its a ponziponzis get people because they actually pay out the money, so they are totally legit until the day they aren't
Remember that BTC fees are averaging $10 per transaction the past week.
Maybe invest in another coin.
but it's basically gamblingYeah that's fine, I just have a £100 laying around and thought it might be fun to convert.
How would I go about it?Thanks for confirming, I fucking knew it.There's transaction fees?Doesn't that go against the whole idea of bitcoin...?>Maybe invest in another coinAny come to mind?
What would you suggest?Not looking to put in more than £100.
It's just a chump investment that I want to sit there for a while until the day I'd like to maybe help buy my next car or something like that.
