Using an older android phone but my blockfolio app is updated.
Can't find night mode or any of the other features like showing holding as a % of portfolio or hiding amounts.
Wtf?
Also post your folios, I guess
Should just be right there in settings.Decent portfolio, a little too diversified for my tastes.
Rate me guys.
Am continuing to accumulate more REQ over time.
yeah, mine looks different.
weird
It'd be okay to be that diversified if your portfolio was worth more than $6k
Pic related is settings.
Wtf, where is it reeeeee
I guess, I'm not sure what the problem is with having like 2k in omg, 2k in link, 2k in req and then building up 5-7 other coins over time to around 1k eachI'm adding fiat every few weeks so I'm open to suggestions, and definitely willing to take big risks.
I'll go all in on a coin for sure if it makes sense.
Thought about just going all in on req and waiting for a 15-20x and then buying something else once it moons.
Not sure.
I kinda like the long game of slowly accumulating coins like a mutual fund where I dump $50 into 10 coins every few weeks and in a few years I have a nice portfolio.
The update on android somehow is missing for me.
How do you clear your screen on blockfolio i accidentally clicked something i shouldnt have
Settings you silly faggot you probably didnâ€™t even look.
jfc theres gonna be some pink wojaks when all this shit continues to fall
I have the same problem, and I can't even connect to Google play and update because of fucking chinese phone
At the playstore go all the way to the bottom of the blockfolio page and click the I'm in button to beta test the newest version.
Thank you based anon
Thx
Your smallest holding is the biggest winner.
You are diversifying wrong
