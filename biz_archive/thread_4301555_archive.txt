Anon, why dont you hold any salt?EOY predictions?
EOY 2$
Sold my stack today at +50% to get in on BCC.
Will probably buy back within a few days, solid coin
EOY $15 minimum if their roadmap goes to plan
Price depends on the success of the platform.
I think if normies see SALT = $25 on the platform they'll FOMO into SALT on exchanges to get that sweet deal, then we can dump on them.
I'd like to see anywhere from $15-20 EOY
Platform launch, this coin is going to be around $22-24.
The services it offers and the discrepancy of price on the platform ($25) as compared to the exchanges should be small enough to draw people into buying it until the price evens out at $25 +- $0.25 on the exchange.too lazy to convert to satoshis.
Also price is not fixed on platform so memberships may cost more in 2018 and the price on the exchange will reflect
Because I want to make money and not be a loser.
Tell us what you're holding mate
