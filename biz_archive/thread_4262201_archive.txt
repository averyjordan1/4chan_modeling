Hey /biz/, which exchange should I use?
Im trying to buy link.
>buying linkDo you hate money?
Binance.
Buy and send it to your wallet and don’t let those fucking bots have their LINK back.
coss
Coss.Dont listen to this faggot Buying on Binance you literally are giving money to the Binance bots that fucking ruined LINK.
Seriously, use Coss or EtherDelta
True link marines use coss
While i do agree that Binance are a bunch of fuckers and that we shouldn’t use their exchange, we’d probably benefit from taking away as much LINK as possible from their exchange and moving it to other exchanges after the fact.
No idea what Coss is, but ED is the best exchange to buy LINK.
EtherDelta.
No KYS.
No bullshit.
Just trading.
Coss is the future of centralised exchange!
No KYS.I meant no KYC.
God damn it.
