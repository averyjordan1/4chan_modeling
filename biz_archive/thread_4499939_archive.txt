http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/11/170623According to this BTC will have problems to compete with more advanced currencies in the future.
It's only advantage had been being first.
Thoughts on the study?
Has this been discussed here before?
Skycoin > Bitcoin
What does more advanced mean here?
Based on this, what would be the best thing to do?
Are XMR, LTC, ETH more "future proof"?
Would 50% BTC 40% those mentioned above and 10% risky alts be a sensible approach?
To clarify: it's a study by the Royal Society with data from 2013 until early 2017.They are not dumping on crypto here, just advising caution.
Are any non-brainlets in here who can comment on this?
