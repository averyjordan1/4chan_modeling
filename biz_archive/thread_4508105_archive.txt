Told you pussies about the REQ moon mission yeaterday.
Get on the ship or get left behind faggots
Fuckin a man
lol it's actually starting to moon for real.
volume has picked up a lot.
i might actually buy in for this one.
Req holders can look forward to an ending every bit as happy as that movie.
Moon time.
Take profit from POWR and RDN and move onto the next big move.
This and AST are blasting off in tandem.
Can we SAGE this a bit longer?
when do I sell???
Elaborate?
huh ?
It's still 25% below ICO.
x20 from here we can talk about selling
why?
If req goes 20x from here, it will go 200x
REQ holder here : we are not fucking selling !
Our hands of steel will wait till at least x5.
Req deserve to be huge.
Tfw just sold at peak of $.057 feels fuckin good
hands of steel > x5You're not thinking big enough.
You poor pajets it hurts me to watch you euphoric and getting dumped over and over again.It cant "moon" before you get out of dumpster (above ico)
