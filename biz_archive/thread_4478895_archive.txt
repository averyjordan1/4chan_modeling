It's not a stable market, if BTC has a uptrend all the alts lose value and that fuck up your investment.Rather than that, the "buy low sell high, don't be too greedy" is common sense, but we would all be millionarie if it was so easy to do.
Sell at 2hr high buy at 24hr low
this is reasonable.
but pay attention to daily trends and don't regret missed excess profits
