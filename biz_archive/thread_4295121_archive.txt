Short side or long?Few days for the former
I was thinking short.
You think it'll take a few more days for it to start downward again?
I think a few more days until it resumes uptrend
Ah I see, same thinking.
lel this might sound stupid but how do i close a position?
Bitmex UI is a little weird.
Do the opposite of the position, so if you are short, buy contracts back.
If you are long, sell contracts.
I see, my window was actually kind of small, when I expanded it I saw the market and limit sell.
Thanks!

Not him but if you are gambling going up to 20x it's practicaly, otherwise stick to around 2.5x like most exchanges let you do, or 5x if you wanna get dem gainz
