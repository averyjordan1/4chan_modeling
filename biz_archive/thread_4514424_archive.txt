XMR will form a cup and handle much like BCH did a few days before its bullrun.It will go to .032 by next Thursday.
sold at .02
No way that a triple top double harami, and if you zoom in recently, theres a bullish morning doji, but it came under the ichis cloud
being this much of an autistic weeb
XMR aint got shit on BCH
What BCH did was not a bullrun, that was dragonslayer's first test run.
Just wait and you will see a real bullrun.
Fuck that trash coin.
I spent all day sweating bullets in BCH, and just managed to get out at an $8 loss after fees.
Never buying that trash coin again.
