Okay so say i have my funds parked in another coin.When bitcoin drops to say 5k, could I just sell my parked funds in my altcoin for BTC and if BTC goes up I get the % increase right?
anyone
are you asking if when you have bitcoin and it goes up if you get profit????
if you need to ask these questions i'd advise you to get out of crypto right now and go do something else
Sorry, crypto to crypto is confusing to me
If there's a trading pair available on the exchange you're using you can trade the alt for bitcoin yes.
If not you're gonna have to sell the alt for usd and then buy btc with it.
Either way, it's possible.
If bitcoin goes up while you have bitcoin you can then sell it later for what its worth at that point, if bitcoin goes up while you have funds in alts you miss out and you'll have to buy btc for the price at that point
Not how it works
Makes sense now thank you bro
