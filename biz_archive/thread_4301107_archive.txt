NULS STATUS UPDATE
I really like the look of that chart.
What's that up against?
WTC?
Correct, but NULS will be bigger.
Really excited about the AMA on Monday.
Fells good to be in.
Nuls will be big... look how it's slowly rebounding....after it being ass raped by 4chan and weak hands that want a Lambo by holding for only a day or two.l this is positively a HODL !!
Can someone tell me how this isn't a shit coin?
Its website is vague, its Twitter is crypto news and motivational quotes with pretty pictures.
Seriously, explain why I should care about this outside of a p and d.
I don't know shit about this coin but the fact that binance adds it that quickly says enough I believe.
Binance only lists legit projects.
NULS has shit tech and a shit roadmap.
Drop your bags and stop shilling it.
They just added btc cash today.
I don't think tech matters.
