I need your help /biz/, I've got .1 BTC burning a hole in my pocket, should I drop it into MOD or REQ?
They're both looking promising
both?
neither, rdn+sub
75% REQ and 25% MOD
req
Or you could be responsible human being and drop it in XRP.
Request has the potential to become the biggest non blockchain coin,simply because it will be the most useful to the masses.While blockchain prices are essentially madeup, paypal is a 100 billion dollar company.Request aims to be a cheaper more useful version, and ready by q1 next year.No brainer.
ReqMod always looks that is about too moon but it never does
How does one acquire req?
Binance, Kucoin, Liqui, Etherdelta
