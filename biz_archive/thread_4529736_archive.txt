We hope you listened when we told you to get in BCH, so where are those gloating Corecucks at when BCH hit $900 and we told you to think like a whale and start accumulating?
We're about to break the new 24 hour high again just think about how much money you could of had in gains!All you had to do was listen, but it's too late now even Ethereum has broken its ATH after we suggested to make a play on Ether and not go on BCH since you missed the rocketship.
I hope you at least got in Ether if you're such a sourpuss about Bitcoin Cash.
You did get in at least one or the other right Anon?
I bought the BTC dip.
See you in 10k
Drunk and watching Blade of the Immortal, and got my first ever 1.5 BCH ready to sell whenever this hits the heights (0.21BTC+).
All nighter for me bro?
So you're admitting that BCH is about to top out?kek.
For your sake I sincerely hope so, buy the dip or go into FOMO overdrive at $1800 :^)
NO BREAKS
Bump.
no breaks
Momoji would never lie.
I'm literally all in on bch.
