No memes, no misinfo, where do I start investing the extra money I've found myself with.
Obviously crypto is in sights, but I was also looking at drop shipping and other methods I could see a little cash within a few months in order to reinvest in my online money making methods.
Are these methods still viable?
Or do I all in on mining and trading.
Stock maybe?
Im in it for the long run, just need to know where to start
Invest all in BTC and double your money with Yobit dice game.
Take doubled money and put in ARK to make 100x returns.
Buy mansion in prostitution county in Nevada with crypto gains and turn it into a brothel.
Invest brothel earnings to create a camwhore site.
Invest camwhore site earnings to create national non-shit (unlike Starbucks) coffee chain in America.
Invest all gains now to create new space exploration company to compete or collaborate with Nasa and SpaceX and colonize Mars.
Now become first president of Mars colony and tax Martian residents.
