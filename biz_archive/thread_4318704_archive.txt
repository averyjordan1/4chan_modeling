FFS.RLC is worth around 65% more on HitBTC than on Bittrex.
And yet I don't know about any way to withdraw i from bittrex.
I noticed this too.
Why?
What do you mean you can't withdraw from Bittrex?
As in you don't know what wallet to do or have Bittrex locked RLC?
I'm fucking retarded...Pressed the deposit instead of withdraw.
Thanks for making me look again
4318773Fucking hell, nevermind.
Now I remember what was wrong.
Depositing into HitBTC is unavailable
I'm curious as to why there's such a big difference though.
Looks fishy.
I'm not setup with HitBTC, but let us know if you're able to do arbitrage.
Still doesn't make sense for there to be such a big price difference.
Why would anyone be buying at 13500 on HitBTC when they can buy at 7800 on Bittrex?
No idea... Just wish the people on Bittrex followed that trend and pumped it hard
Eh... guys?
What happens next?
What country is HitBTC?
Why the arbitrage?
I guess it is just the bots on HITBTC fapping on each other due to deposits not being available to create some attention.
But in reality it is totally worthless.
I also own 12k RLC and had my hopes high, but this won't make anything for us.
Couldn't I technically buy from bittrex, trade to hitBTC and sell, rinse repeat?
what the fuck
no because you cant deposit anything to hitbtc
You sure can if you're fast enough
why?
is there some sort of technical problem or they just simply dont allow it?
Whats wrong with deposits?
4319027It says "unavailable".
I already tried to sell my 12k RLC from bittrex.
=)
hmmm i wonder if its just maintenance or something
