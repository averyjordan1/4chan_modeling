I'm going all in on this as a last hurrah.
If it dumps I'm quitting but it doesn't look like it will
Yeah think I'm going to sign up for it now.
Presale got a 700% bonus.
This is going to dump way harder than REQ and AST.
The signup sucks.
You need to provide two photos of your passport.
Where did you read about the bonus?
I thought the presale guys only got a 5-10% bonus after a short lockout period
The team buy back the tokens to prevent it being dumped.
They also offer PreICO incentives to hold it for 3/6month periods.I was tweeting them and they said you need to provide passport but you can block out any sensitive digits.
Pretty sure they just need to see your name on the passport.
oh shit you're right.
Yeah OP don't touch this ICO.
Wait for after the initial dump on exchanges
WRONG WRONG WRONG.
First off all- They have already stated that anyone who participated in the Pre-ICO will have to either Lock Up tokens for 6 months OR the project itself will BUY BACK the tokens.
Pre-ICO holders won't be able to dump on ICO holders.
wow you're autistic as fuck
Ok you're right.
Just read about the lockup period in the whitepaper.
Doesn't look so bad afterall.
Really wtf.
You spread lies before reading anything yourself?
Sad, anon.
4474515How did you guys feel about the passport thing?
As I said to the other guy, apparently you can censor any "sensitive digits", so I presume this means I can censor my passport number, DOB etc...

dude stop sharing this shit man there wont be enough coins left for us if this keeps getting spread
hahaha fuck you
No where else to talk about it man.
