Why the fuck does it censor BAKA?
Anyway google "turnbull-government-invests-in-cryptocurrencybased-company-for-the-first-time" the news website is Sydney Morning Herald.
Baka.comI only clicked for the opportunity to rid myself of these chains.
I'm finally fucking free!!!

Anyway it is legit and one of the biggest newspapers in Australia.
This is the same news as a few days ago.
