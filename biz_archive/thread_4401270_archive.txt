DUMP IT..
Dump all your alts at a loss now.
These alts need one last mega dump before starting over.
What's stopping that from happening?
Bag holders.
All of us that hold heavy bags are preventing their growth.
So we must DUMP them and rebuy 30-40% lower.
I already dumped my bags at a 10% loss.
Now I'm calling on you.
Do it and feel the relief.
Here is my proof

I don't care if it's a shitcoin.
If I sold any alt it would most likely 10x before I could get back in.
