This is for discussing how to survive/gain from a crypto market crashScenario 1: Crash happens, but status quo restores itselfAt the start of the crash be holding 1/2 BCH in Jaxx wallet and 1/2 fiat on Coinbase.
Buy LTC and ETH at the bottom and hold them.
Using Jaxx onboard shapeshift trade BCH for BTC at the bottom.
Scenario 2: Crash happens, BCH replaces BTCSame as before except hold BCH insteadScenario 3: Crash happens, and Bitcoin is king again but irreparably weakenedDon't do anything differentlyAll of this assumes that 1) the crash is caused by Tether so you can't use a Tether-based exchange and 2) BCH will boom before anything else because it is seen as the "opposition" to Bitcoin and by extension the instability that caused the crash.
ride the shit as long as it goes>it crashes>sell the bounceif you believe it will drop anyway, just sell the bounce, Bitcoin usually goes up after the bounce though
Well given that this *is* the bounce, gives us a difficult call to make.
i definitely took profit at 8250, but i sitll belive it will go to 20k
