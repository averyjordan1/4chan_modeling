4338421Yup, we've been accumulating all night between 80 and 90.
It's only a matter of time.
The CMC supply fix will pump it.Exchange announcements will pump it.No one is asking you to go for the long term hodl, but there is serious money to be made here for sure.
thanks for the information, I'm out
You can apply that logic to Confido and see where it would have got you.
You could have bought in at 5x ICO and still made a total killing.
With all the news coming up for HST its a no brainer.
I'll be honest I sold at 90, but I got back in at 80, I couldn't convince myself not to.
You'll regret my friend.
This is another CFD in the works at the beginning stages.
Look at the volume increasing every hour.
They'll say it's too late to get in now and cry when it skyrockets even more.
Still more than enough room to grow on this moon mission.
Put around $800 in last night before it hit 0.0008, sitting comfy
hst?
In at .00059, didn't sell yet.
This one has too much gas left in the tank
I doubled off confido and I bought at 10x ico
totally useless token.
this is what the blockchain can do by itself without a token *mind blown*
how is that relevant??
The UN thinks differently.. ;)
HST and CFD are the true moon missions right now.
If only biz would listen to us.
Easy gains can be made with these.
Get in!!
