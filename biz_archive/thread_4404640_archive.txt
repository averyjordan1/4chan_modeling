Aight that was fun, sold all 65k FENX I had for about 6k.
Thanks to all you who participated in purchasing my bags.
Sorry for the people I called retarded.
I'm gonna post a thread tonight with some particularly funny momentsPSA: FENX is an obviously shit ICO.
There is literally no reason anyone would want to own these tokens.
They have a terrible website, a probably fake team, a whitepaper I could write in a day with no research, and absolutely no technical merit behind their project.
Do yourselves a favor and don't buy things /biz/ shills you
whats the contact address for this shit?i dont see it on ED
Look it up on etherscan put that address into Etherdelta url
