BTG is $199 on Bitfinex.
BTG is $300 on Bittrex.
Buy on Bitfinex, send to Bittrex, sell.
Profit.
Tell me what is wrong with that plan?
Other than the fact that you can't send BTG from Bitfinex right now, its not set up or something?
the fact that you can't send BTG from Bitfinex right nowwell if you have access to your free BTG you can make the sale and rebuy
Why do all the threads on /biz/ feature thumbnail images?
It costs you nothing to post an asian fit for more than ants
Already sold it.
Now bought BTG on Bitfinex for$195, as soon as I can send it to Bittrex, will send it and sell at $300.
Repeat.Huge arbitrage loop open right now for those who know what they are doing.
That is not the ideal way to do this.
You keep bch and btc on both exchanges.
As one increases, you buy up on the other.
You then equalize later on.
Best done with a bot.
by the time you actually send your money from one exchange to the other its gonna be equal again
well take it if you can, once everyone can send I expect the arb closes thoughthis
I'm not followingWhat does this have to do with BTG.
