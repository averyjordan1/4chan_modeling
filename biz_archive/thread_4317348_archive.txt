Move money into ETH or USDT?
ETH or XMR
ETH
get eth and buy some tokens if the market is to much of a gamble for you right nowi mean what you gonna do with USDT?
except lose money
ThisTether runs on a layer on top of BTC blockchain and it's literally printing fake dollars for free.
If people mass sell tether, exchanges aren't going to honor it for 1 dollar's worth anymore.
Well that sucks.
Seems like ETH is more independent than XMR
