Fuck off with this inflatable shitcoin that is pretty much useless in crypto terms.
Ripple is way overinflated and they can make as much coin as they want.
Scam

How many times before making that post have you wojaked and begged mommy for a BTC retrace?
It's different, healthy retracements are 50%< even maybe 60 70, but almost 100?
It's like a pump and dump.
That doesn't look healthy.

REMINDER TO NOT BUY WHEN IT'S ALREADY MOONING.
IF YOU DIDN'T GET IN BEFORE, DON'T TRY OR YOU'LL LOSE MONEY.
DON'T FALL FOR THE FOMO.
THIS BOARD IS FULL OF PAJEETS TRYING TO PUMP COINS AND THEN FUCK YOU IN THE ASS WITH THEIR BAGS, THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.
As long as you can get in before it hits 30 cents you're still good.
Don't be confused though.
Ripple DOES NOT MEAN XRP.
Whenever there is good news for Ripple XRP drops.
