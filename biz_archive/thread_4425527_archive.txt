Is it true that I need a certain amount of LINK to run a node or is that a meme?
afaik there isn't a minimum amount, but you're considered more trustable if you have a lot of LINK
Niceee I'm way more motivated now.Hopefully I will get a shitton of link after some good trades this week.
Let's see.
The more LINK a node operator has the higher priority they get.
Other factors in priority include the date they provide and their uptime.
Nodes providing private data to banks for example will need to run Intel SGX so that they cant "see" or manipulate the data they are providing.
Data* not date
Is running this on a vm enough?
Wouldn't be better to run it baremetal?
