Brainlet here, assuming someone is really spamming the blockchain, how long can they realistically keep this up?
I mean the cost of spamming the network isnt necessarily free.
Is it possible for them to spam Bitcoin so hard for an entire year until transactions are so expensive and take weeks to confirm?
What the fuck will happen when there are a 1 billion unconfirmed transactions?
No one is spamming the blockchainPeople are abandoning the ship by unlocking their cold storagethat's why the volume is high Bitcoin is technically flawed that it cannot handle this much volume
The argument that this backlog is entirely spam attack comes mostly from core shills in an attempt to distract from the fundamentally crippling block size limit in place at present.In reality thinking that this many transactions are all spam is simply preposterous.Spam attacks are not free.
Admittedly such attacks are much cheaper when blocks are persistently full and each transaction can sit in the mempool for days to weeks without being processed.
But a persistent spam attack is extraordinarily costly.
