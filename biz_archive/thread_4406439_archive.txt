So /biz/ what do you guys think of cointed?
Haven't heard it mentioned around here, probably because its still in pre-ICO.
I personally think, since its providing ATMs, its gonna be a favourite with governments and such since it gives them a way to track altcoins as well as being popular with general crypto users for its ease-of-use.Hit me with your criticism
