LOOK AT THE VOLUME.
HALF OF BCH IS BEING TRADED BY THE GOOKS.
THEY WILL DUMP ON YOUR CLUELESS ASS.
GET OUT BEFORE THOSE JUGHEADS TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY
Holy shit 750 wtf is going on
No they are just getting ready for the flippening tomorrow caused by miners abandoning BTC chain to let it stall at 4-8hours per transaction.
Panic selling will be massive.
I've known that Koreans were buying this, they're not wrong though.
The flippening.
What OP neglects to inform you of is the expansive mining scene in korea.
Miners and traders in the know have begun liquidating their btc into BCH
Is pump over or still worth buying some bch
It will be worth buying for the next 9 days.No need to fud and fomo, but you should move all profits there stat if you want to keep them when the bitcoin legacy chain freezes.
pathetic fud, core needs to axe some of you poorer-performing pajeets.
bithumb has made up that amount of volume for a while now, probably because gooks are getting tired of the western reddit core crew steering bitcoin off a cliff
yup that's right guysminers shifted to mining btc and will dump itthe flippening is by us.
we, the people, are in control
It's not over yet, BCH will go much higher when people wake up to the fact that Bitcoin is stuck with $10 transaction fees for now
It's more like "you, a few mining oligarchs" but OK.
The first flippening will be BTC being destroyed by BCH, but before start of next year, ETH will overtake BCH in another flippening.
Might happen as early as when BCH gets its corrective dip (that turns into freefall dip) after mooning when BTC implodes.
Nice FUD
Are you the one who keeps posting pink wojaks because you made an insanely stupid play?
I need some more for my folder
Chinese are using Korean markets to trade.
Nope.What makes you think that?
Gentlemen.
Let me make this clear.This is miners liquidating their BTC for BCH
