Been buying low and selling hi for a almost 2 hours .. but what the fuck is this so obv manipulating
preping for another pump?
are they accumulating a that line or showing fake buy walls
How can you tell if P+D or not?
I suposse soIts not shitcoin like others
Probably bots, I love bots.
So easy to spot and ride their waves up and down.
Easiest coins I've ever made.
Don't have any of this, but it happens on other coins I hold and it's the best when bots show up!
so buy or no buy?
haha
Insider info?
If you look at these periods of stagnation after pumos from the previous few days youll see that they pump the fuck righy after it.
Well see another pump shortly

good to know.
thank you
someone just put a buy order for 100000 of these at current price
There is a LOT of stop hunting happening.
Obvious manipulation.
They let the coin look like it's about to tank, then right when it's at the point of no return they bring it back
