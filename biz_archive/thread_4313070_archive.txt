Tfw jumped into BCH too late.Bought at 1700 and I'm thinking to set stop loss at 1530 BUT I'm afraid BCH will dump hard until below my stop loss and then bounce back to rally to 2k.Do you guys set stop loss or going YOLO?
It'll hit 2k tonight, just dont panic
IT'S HITTING 2K RIGHT NOWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yea I'm watching closely.
Might skip sleep tonight.
But I feel like a dumbass if I didn't set a stop loss.Do you set one?
and we're back just enough time for a piss and a some tendies.
I use Binance which doesn't have stop losses and I don't know enough to program a bot to do it manually.I definitely aint sleeping tonight
A stop loss is just a sell order at way below normal levels.
