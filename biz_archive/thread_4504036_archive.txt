bought some before the PBC announcement, should i sell or hold?
i see mixed opinions on this one, some people love it while others call it a centralized memecoin.
worth holding for 1-2 years?
Hodl.
What average?
This thing has a very limited coin supply (60% of circulating coins are staked) and is about to become the PayPal of crypto and the weed industry.
Don't even think about selling, unless you don't like money.
