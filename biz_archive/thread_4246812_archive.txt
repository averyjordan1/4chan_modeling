wrong link 
what do you mean?
How can you be down on this coin, its just got listed for a day
well he shilled it during ATH on binance, so it cost a fortune to buy BNB to buy NUL.
Now you BTC rising, which drops the ATLs values.
So if u bought it at the time of the thread, you would've got double penetrated, hence OP.
