Why I didn't sell BCH earlier?
God damn it.
I could have 100k EUR now.
Instead, I have 23k (started with 14k in October).
Still made big gains with BCH but god damn it.
I'm so fucking depressed right now.
hodl.
eventually the time will come.
it ever does.
with anything in crypto
Already dumped the majority so I have equal quantity of BTC and BCH and small bags of shitcoins on the side.
The last few days have been so fucking stressful.
Not goibg to choose sides.
Whichever coin wins, I have it.
I guess things could be worse
indeed.. i also have both - and personally like the idea of bch more.
so i'll credit it with some of my money
Always sell on the hype/news, ALWAYS.
I learned this lesson the hard way.
It doesn't matter if it's a coin that's endorsed by Jesus and solves cancer, it will always be overbought, and will drop hard afterwards.
If I would've listened to my own advice months ago I currently would've had about $200k, instead I have 40k.
I was actually asleep when BCH peaked.
It was just incredibly difficult to sell afterwards.
I set limit orders at 0.25, 0.34 and 0.5 but it never got that high again.

Yeah...sleep is the biggest gains goblin.
That's why I set up alerts for anything over 2x.
Catching a moon mission is worth one fucked up night.
