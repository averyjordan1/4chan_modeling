If you look to all the major exchanges, whales are holding the price of BTC and BCH in lockstep with each other, as best they are able.
They're doing this utilizing those cheap BTC they picked up last weekend and BCH the weeks prior.
By holding the prices in lockstep even as the difficulty plummets for BCH, they're artificially lifting the profitability for mining keeping it just shy of BTC's.
But there's a snag.
In just about 3 days' time, BTC will have a difficulty adjustment.
With all that recovered hash power, the only way to adjust is up.
So the BTC difficulty spikes when the mempool is cleared, and BCH has been just a trickle for 10 days, certainly well more than 144 blocks.
And now it becomes more profitable.
And everyone in North America is distracted with family, enjoying turkey and wine as their fortunes get locked-away for all eternity in a dead blockchain.
English please.
