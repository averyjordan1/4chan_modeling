Hello I'm new, I want to deposit 500€, but Coinbase has insane fee, Bitstamp even worse, I don't know what's out there also that can reduce it.I want to buy ETH and then some coins on exchanges, how do I get through the cheapest way?

Use a referral code for coinbase so after you transfer more than $100 to them you get £10 back.
this
Bitstamp even worseBank remittance is completely free on here.
bitstamp has free bank transfer for euros lol.tard.
Send usd from bank to coinbase which is free.
Next send usd to gdax and buy bitcoin on gdax.
Next send bitcoin to coinbase.
Gdax is owned and used by coinbase.
Coinbase trades your money on gdax exclusively pretty sure

I have another question, that I'm not sure about.
When I create new Wallet on MyEtherWallet, how do I backup my wallet?
Do I just download the Keystore File and Copy it onto USB and is that understood as backed up?
buying ETHyou watch marxist cp too while youre at it?
are you really this retarded?
I guess.
As much as I've understood, you download the github ETH folder, put into Keystore File, also make text file with Private Key Address and that's it.
I'm just unsure about 'back up' terminology in general.
Is that it basically?
Just want to make 100% sure.
Create an address with MEW using Keystore / JSON File and with a passwordSave the address and private key (and maybe password if you are using one you are likely to forget) in a text fileSave the Keystore / JSON File on your computerAny time to want to open the wallet to send or check the balance you login by uploading your Keystore / JSON File followed by your password.If you just want to check your balance it would be easier to make a bookmark for your address on etherscan.ioThe whole geth thing is if you are downloading the blockchain for a standalone full wallet (e.g.
Parity, Ethereum Wallet, MIST, etc) but there is no point with MyEtherWallet (MEW).
