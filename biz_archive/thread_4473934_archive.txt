What's happening with NEO?I don't get it what are you guys talking about
Chink man hyped up old news and now weak hands are dumping
Aah oke, so no new news coming?
someone has to sit down with these asians and explain to them hyping up their coin, telling people to wait for the news always makes people question there validity, neo, omg, wtc all do this, they need to hire proper PR people.
It wasn't an asian that started all this, it was a bald American.
