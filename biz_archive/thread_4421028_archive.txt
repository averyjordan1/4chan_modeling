I feel like I've reached an important part in a video game.
There are two paths.Door #1)I sell my All in Neo position for a modest profit.
Door #2) I stay all in on NEO holding for 2.5 days and I see how deep the bunny hole goes.Perhaps a life altering choice.
Door #3Take profit by selling a portion while keeping the rest in case it continues to moon.
Woa stop it with your logic
