He's such a terrible representative of Ethereum
Vitalik doesn't hardfork unless he has money in it.
He had money in dao so it was his problem.
Parity he doesn't care about even though value is much bigger than dao
lmao the only other option would be to hardfork ethereum, which aint going to happen unless vitalik wants to kill ethereum for goodpeople that unironically trusted third party wallets, software or hardware doesn't matter, deserve this kind of reminder that you only use the official wallet or just leave it on the exchangesthis is good for ethereumbesides, if you are lucky, it might be added in the next metropolis fork, but it really shouldn't
So what about the 500k eth?Lost forever?Who's gonna invest in these kike if he doesn't fix it?
"It's not eth proublem broh" yeah it is.
Thank you skelly
Kek, faggot SJW
Wow.
Anyone who is in pariety is fucked while the rest of us dodged a major bullet either from dumb luck or researching wallets before using them
He made me a ton of money but I hate this faggot
researching wallets before using themSure because you did research and found out that this wallet was killable through parity right?No one knew anything.
Ethereum was a lot smaller last year as well.
The lost coins are a marginal amount of the market cap compared to the same dollar value last year.
It wasn't vitalik's fault it's retards using non official 3rd party apps
You don't hardfork because a project on ethereum is making mistakes.
lol.
keep /pol/ in /pol/
Thanks, just sold 100k
jesus
You realize when he says that shit he's talking about the kike media?
