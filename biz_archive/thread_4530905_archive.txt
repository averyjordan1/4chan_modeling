uhm guys, it's about to drop below $7900
it's going much lower than that, senpai
bottom is at 6k
the bottom is at zero.get in bch while you can.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA GET OUT OF MY WAY I NEED TETHERS!
I got some in LTC and NEO, am I safe or am I going down with the ship?
Fuck same lad.
I can't handle this rollercoaster.
Sorry lad, there's no getting off the rollercoaster.
If you do get into tethers you're still going to be glued to the price making sure you didn't sell low and it's not taking off without you.
Hope fully it goes back to 5k I wanna buy again :^)
What coins are best to jump into?
print em
Go eth and bch
Lmao at these bubble riders shilling BCH.
If you want to day trade, dump your BTC, buy BCH, and dump in 2 days when BCH crashes.
Buy BTC before it rebounds.
BTC will come out of this dip at 9k.
Retards who think BCH swill ever overtake BTC deserve their long term losses.
