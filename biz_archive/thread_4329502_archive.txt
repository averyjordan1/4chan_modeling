I am honestly scared I might lose all my gains.
Brought by first Bitcoin at $450in may 2016, had fun with trumpcoin, dgb, ark, link.
Right now I have an uneasy feeling it the comming weeks.
I am suspecting Bitcoin core will crash to the mid $1000s at it's worst and killing Bitcoin cash too.
Veterans will probably be still in profit but all the panic normies will cause will make it insane.
Probably cause a mt gox panic pt 2.
youre fucking retarded
