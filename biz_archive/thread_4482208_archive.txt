buying ICOs and then dumping them - the easiest, foolproof method to make money?i've noticed that even if you bought confido at token sale you'd make 2x profit easily.
also, if it's some solid long term hold you can usually buy it back after initial hype passes and dissapointed people unload their bags.
am i wrong about this or people who know this "trick" too just keep their mouths shut?
pls respomg
delet this
most icos or almost all icos recent 2months have gone below ico price.
I guess the first icos or those mid year were better but now theres just too many.
You are a few months too late from ICO flipping.
ICOs which moon at the start are rarer now, and those that succeed like Power Ledger take a week to go to good prices.
Good projects with potential like REQ and AST got shat on recently and are still under ICO price.
And too many peple started doing it so I mean everyone who bought already got in and lot of em are just waiting to dump.
so mostly it doesnt even start high when it begins trading
This, also keeping up to date on all these different icos, their terms, way of doing things, white lists etc.
Is really annoying.
> and those that succeed like Power Ledger take a week to go to good pricesseems like it took a day or two for it to go from 0.05 to 0.15, is that not good enough for you?
