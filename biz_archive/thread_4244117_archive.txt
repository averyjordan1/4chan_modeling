- November 17th, Friday: Token Burn will be done.
Total amount will be about 80 million.
-Total supply now 500 million.
So 84% tokens will be burnt.-They will also lock up the tokens held by ALIS founders, about 15% of total issued tokens.
During the lock up period, no one can sell or buy these tokens.
This will prevent the founders from not committing to the long term product development and selling out the tokens on early stages.-15% from 80 million tokens will be locked up.So after burn and lock up total supply will be decreased from 500 million to 68 million.ALIS is Japanâ€™s First Social Media Platform Using Blockchain Technology.So as long as Steem has no plans to enter Japanese market, ALIS doesn't have a direct competitor.Market cap now only 10 Million $That is definitely moon mission.
At least it will be 5x - 7x from where it is now.https://medium.com/@alismedia/important-announcement-about-token-burn-and-lock-up-7d6761457a7bhttps://twitter.com/alis_media?lang=en
