Heres my theory on whats going to happen with BCH/BTC in the coming day.
Let me know what you think.>BTC adjusts difficulty 4 hours from now>Becomes more profitable again, most hashpower switches back to it>FUD hits BCH, drops down to 1k>whales eat the speculators and weak hands at this levelk transactions start getting confirmed because of the hashpower switching back>Many of these transactions are people taking profit because the evens of the last while show BTC is too risky, or they want in on BCH.>BTC goes back down>BCH back up.
1000 -> 2+kHow realistic is this?
I'm thinking I should sell my BCH now (I was drinking and doing lines last night and when I got home I was too irrational to sell last night, unfortunately)
I'm expecting a pump just because of how many bagholders there are now.
bch and btc are locked in a death struggle,.
both will probably die in the long run as ethereum goes PoS and ascends beyond miner drama.until then 30/30 in both and 40% into bitcore
the real retard ladies and gentlemen
4322977so should I sell now?
I feel like selling low is dumb, but I could lock in 9k profit right now(a lot for me i am unemployed broke boy)...
