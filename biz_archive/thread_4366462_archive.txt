There's a whale group on discord talking about pumping ETP hard this weekend.
In case you didn't know, right ETP is only available on Bitfinex (making it easier to pump).
Also there's a rumor about a Bittrex listing before the end of the month
Korean Whales have started discords and Slacks, in anticipation of the Korea meetup.
Privileged information guys.
Bullish on ETP.
They're constantly releasing news, almost daily at this point.
Not a matter of if, but when.
scam coin.
worth 50 cents.
I lost 100k after my wallet stopped working.
How can this coin succeed if they cant even make a working wallet.
Maybe back up your mneumonic and not be a fucking idiot?
People that are complaining are people that deserve to lose money, you fucking fools.
all this fudbro the wallet is fine, what are you a boomer, learn2computer
wtf I have my mneumonic saved.
The wallet is corrupt.
All my coins were missing one day.
The devs are paying randys to shill this coin on 4chan in hopes that poor people who missed neo will buy it.
Those who bought are so ignorant they will never look at the bad side of this coin.
It's okay tho, they deserve to lose :P
got your key?
got your coins, that simple, that's how this works.
Wallet FUD can only work for so long, market sentiment is unaffected by it now even more so that the light wallet is coming, making it even easier for retards like yourself.
