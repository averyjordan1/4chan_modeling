why are block times on BCH still... errrr... you know...... fluctuating even after the fork?
Because Craig Wright wrote the DAA in crayon.
They aren't?The problem was many hours between blocks sometimes.
That has been fixed.
10 minute fluctuations is pretty normal
CW only uses marker pens on transparent glass
No glass - nothing that can be made sharp.
difficulty adjustment only increases or decreases the probability that a block will be found in 10 minutes.
Some get lucky and get one in 2 minutes while it might take the whole network 17 minutes to get the next one.
