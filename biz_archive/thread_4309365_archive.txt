total noob herebch is forking on 13th of nov right?What will happen exactly?
Does it also gets split into 2 currencies?
Because i only read that it just "updates"Dunno what to do with my bch can i just keep it and hope for the best or what?
Noob indeed.
The fork has been suspended.. not happening.
You're about a week late brah
you misreadbch will fork to implement a change in the difficulty adjustment algo.there will not be two different coins as it is not a contentious fork, not a fork where there is a significant party who disagrees with the change.Were there to be two coins (sounds silly even typing this) your coins are safe if you control the private keysbitcoin and other currencies have forks all the time, 99% are not contentious
You only get two currencies if two things happen1.
There is disagreement among the miners over whether the update should be done2.
Exchanges are willing to list both versions of the coinIf both 1 and 2 are not satisfied then it's essentially just a software update.
ok, thanks anon
Who is that fine lady sir?
