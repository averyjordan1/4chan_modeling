OK big boys, we've stabilised at 0.3.
Everyone get ready for the push to 0.4.
Stay frosty.
And btc at ATL.
Normies are getting out.
And they probably won't come back, not even to bch.
Doing my part.
To the extent I can dump BTC and cement a strong future for Bitcoin, here I go.
which exchange?
I want to watch
Larping tripfagsOh boy
https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-BCCIndeed it's a blast to watch.
Yeah precisely, if the difficulty adjustment tomorrow doesn't end this shitshow I am cashing out, I've made enough profit off this shit and I don't like the look of where things are heading..
I just wish I had already made enough to never have to come back

Bittrex crapping out again or is just me?
yeah crashed on me too, they dumping on us right now?
4314316 managed to get another buy order in, then it crashes right away to .36 fuck sakes Bittrex is just garbage when it needs to work.
It was at .42 and 24 hour high is only .39999 so broken.
Bittrex is a shiiit exchange that rips people off, they have barely any BCH trade volume and they can't handle it.
The koreans are having a good time on Bithumb though, with 10x the volume.
Koreans are backing off though, look at the sell on Bithumb.
Has BCH hit it's peak?First time I've seen a sell for BCH this strong on Bithumb, the western exchanges don't matter here because they don't have the volume.
