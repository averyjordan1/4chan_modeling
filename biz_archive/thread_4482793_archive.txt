I have now entered the crypto game and just bought 0,1 BTC.Feels good to own this much.
And before you start a pissing contest with your 500 BTC, I'd like to remind you that you paid like 5 bucks for it.
I buy BTC with thousands of dollars that I have actually earned at work.
Don't even compare us you privileged early adopter fuck.
From now on people like me are funding your lambos.
sorry but the NSA is here to crash crypto
If I bought 500 Bitcoin at $5 that's still $2500 that I earned and worked for.
Also literally more than you spent on your measly .1btc
You serious or just rolling?
your measly .1btc>measlyThis arrogance is what I hate about you guys.
It only shows how stupid you are.You deserve nothing you fuckstick.Whenever I make ads online about wanting to buy 10 mBTC or so, a few smug people always appear only to tell it's a small amount.
It's like you guys are smelling your own farts.
it feels good
This is an interesting troll thread and so I will indulge you.
See I built a neato gaming computer for about 0.1 btc and then used it to mine about that much crypto, but now I have a computer too and can use it to play sweet games like My Summer Car while I'm waiting for someone to say something dumb on the internet so I can respond.
buying at the ATH>while FUD is on overdriveI'm sure you won't regret it.In two months once it climbs back up :^)
thinks BTC will dipNah bro 10k before christmas.
god bless you faggot

Most of us gainzed from guessing memory wallets, and the rest of us gainzed from pnd

> I'd like to remind you that you paid like 5 bucks for it.Nah, I didn't really pay anything for it, I bought video cards and mined most of it.
