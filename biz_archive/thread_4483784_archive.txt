TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
Today or tomorrow we will hit ath and then it moon mission to 600$ currently holding 26 ether
Eth will have its moon after the BCH vs BTC flippening.
Be patient.
thats not looking like its going to be any time soon
That is already over mate.
In order for Bitcoin Cash to take the Bitcoin name, all exchanges around the world would have flip the names at the exact same time in coordination, otherwise it would cause mass chaos and confusion what the user is buying.
There will never be a flippenning.
I hope someday you'll consider supporting a democratic community of over 100 devs vs a chinese mining corporate giant.
Corps will never take Bitcoin from the people

eth is gonna go from being a 300 dollar bill for months on end to being a 400 dollar bill for months on end all the while depleting in btc value yay
This argument is so stupid.
Exchanges won't switch the name until long after the community beings to prefer BCH over BTC, which could happen organically.
