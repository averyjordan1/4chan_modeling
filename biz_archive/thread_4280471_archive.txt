I just saw a link in reddit, where bitcoin2x announced the continuation of the bitcoin fork on 15th november.
Looks like the alts will reach its deep anyway.https://bitcoin2x.org/
But without the big players supporting it, the price will still be shit.I will dump it all anyways if I get some.
Because even though BTC is always going up, I'm not increasing my BTC amount
Yeah, maybe you're right.
But right now the BTC is extremely dropping :(
what the fuck is going onJUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND!
