I want to start mining Monero.
I can spend $2k-$3k on a rig.
I know absolutely nothing.
Can you guys give me some tips to get me going better than the cursory google search?
Buy a new server..
Mine monero on that.

Go to the Monero website and check the mining page.
There’s a benchmarks list for all of the different GPUs... hashrates and wattage... most profitable GPU for mining Monero right now is AMD Saphire 64 8GB... they run about $500-600 per card... 6-8 cards will net you $400-$600 per month... it will cost you $5000 though... rule of thumb... you’ll need a H/s per Watt of about 5 to make a meaningful profit.
Thank you.
