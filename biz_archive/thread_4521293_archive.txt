BITJOB is your 20X moon.Why?- 880K Market Cap- Undiscovered- WAY Under ICO Price- Large Team( https://bitjob.io/#team )- Only On EtherDelta (https://etherdelta.com/#STU-ETH)- No One KNOWS About It Yet- Experienced Team Developing This For A Year- Not On CoinMarketCapThese are the coins you buy before anyone else does.You're buying it 4x cheaper than ICO.
bitjob more like buttjob ahah
Not on cmc...https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/student-coin/
One of the worst shitcoins.
((they)) built it and you will lose money just like people who invested in Bancor.Bitjob raised most of the funds during the pre-ico, just a small part raised during the ICO.
Which means that the whale who bought around 1+mill of this shit token will dump as soon as there will be enough people buying it.Remember - You will be poor forever "investing" in projects like Bitjob.Bitjob's MVP is fake, it is actually an html css Mockup without real functionality or connectivity to the blockchain.
Bitjob - almost no adequate team members, they've added tons of people there to look good and impressive but there is no substance there.
Also, some shady faces from the crypto community on their "advisory board" - lolThey have no idea what is blockchain or decentralization, just look at their videos on youtube, especially them with dutch gov reps.
Hilarious.
Cheap marketing at its best, they should be selling veggies on local markets instead if trying to change the world.Their decentralization means shit, they intend to charge fees - wtf???
How is it different?
Why do they need blockchain for that.Beware.
