Just put all my life savings into XRP at 2889 AMA
comfy picnot comfy post
why?
Undervalued.
HAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA OP TAKE YOUR PENNIES AND GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE WHILE YOU CAN.
Smart.
I think XRP is getting on a new chinese exchange tommorow too.
Well, I hate to say it, but you're smarter than the ones who put their life savings into LINK
is it though?will ripple make their network accessible for retail remittance of FX because if the answer to that is a resounding YES then I'll borrow from a loan shark to get into ripple.but since their model is beset on appealing to financial institutions' bottom line then I don't see how FI's will adopt XRP mainly due to compliance and risk.so....do you think people will be able to make cross border money transfers?
like western union?
Do you even understand your own thoughts?!
Ripple is literally THE ONLY crypto fully compliant within fintech and big gov.
have fun when they print another 1 Billion coins, just because they CAN do it.
$70 in feb

> Been hodling XRP for a full quarter> Still hasn't been over my purchase price> Missed NEO, BTC, BCH, Omisego and ChainLink major mooningsThese fidget spinners literally crippled my portfolio.

Are you me op?
I am to chicken to levrage it all, how did you get such a good position, i wish i was at that level.
it's a very anemic coinyou want to pour everything into it, goodluck but you're better off putting it in a low risk ETF just saying
Damn OP.
You mean you invested a whole 39 dollars and 12 cents?
Exactly because it is fully compliance with fintech/banks and gov I have doubt it will moon.
Chance are they will want it to be as stable as possible to avoid freak out.Tell me what gov will think if they see the value goes up more than x10 in short time.
