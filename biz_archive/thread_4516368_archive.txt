https://zephyr.bitspark.io/https://bitspark.io/A successful company since 2014.
The company is backed by The Cyberport, a Hong Kong government initiative and has joined acceleration programs such as Accenture Fintech Innovation Labs and SixThirty.
Partnered with the United Nations.What makes them special in terms of the cross-border remittance niche, is that the blockchain aspect is all under the hood.
The end-user doesn't use crypto whatsoever.
The businesses in the network deal with it and the customer gets their local currency.
No bank requiredCurrently only available on the BitShares DEX.
If you make the effort to buy it there before it goes on more exchanges, you will be one step ahead.Very undervalued gem.
Do your own research.

I hope this gets the attention it deserves.
When is supposed to be on Binance?
why tf everything partnered with the United Nations now
Not sure, they just added BitShares itself so the technology is now in place.
The United Nations has some business initiative that you can join with no acknowledgment on their part; it's good for trying to make yourself legitimate like this worthless shitcoin is trying to do
False.
