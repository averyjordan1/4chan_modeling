Will you shitcoins get this over with already?
All this drama for a slight bump in fucking transaction speed.
Can someone tell me again why Ethereum wont kill these three motherfuckers in the future?
Because ETH isn't a currency and you need to read the whitepaper.
Maybe because ethereum was broken by a 13 yr old kid and over 300m In ether was lost
Anything can be a currency as long as people accept it.
This is the same logic that Bitcoiners use to justify Bitcoin's existence.That was a wallet problem, not Ethereum.
Ethereum was never compromised ever even during the DAO hack.
If a website is hacked do you fags blame Java or Python or whatever that website was built on?
Fucking retards.
