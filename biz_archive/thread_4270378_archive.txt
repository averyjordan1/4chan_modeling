so uh... doge is skyrocketing again.
when do we sell?
>skyrocketing>still below 20 sats
im never gonna sell my doggos
selling Doge
% increase since yesterday
You do know that doge is used by whales for transferring large amounts of crypto quickly, don't you?
checked, i know, i missed the dip lol i thought i was getting in the dip at 18 sats, im im diligent i think i'll be right
If the pattern holds, probaby 100sat or so.
Each new pump has brought higher highs, soo think for yourself my dude, but I am not selling 'till about 180 sats
 sats is bullish as fuck.
Plausible, but too aggressive for my blood.
Going to roll my sell orders between 100 and 130 sats.
just set my sell order for 188
Add a four after the one and you're on the right track.
i know right: id be rich if that happened tho lol so i have my doubts about 1488 sats
That would certainly secure the existence of Dogecoin and a future for us shibes.
