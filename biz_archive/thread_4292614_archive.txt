I am stroking out over the fall in BTC, as I've been away for a few days and am holding 3 BTC and watching it crash right now.
Usually I use localbitcoins, but UK traders rates are terrible right now, as no one is buying understandably.I've never used an exchange, and frankly i'm not sure I can trust one to hold £15000+ for a few weeks.
I actually don't want to withdraw it because of taxes.What do?
Send it to me I will hold it for you safely for a 1% fee.
I'm ex CIA u can trust m3
Just hold it.
BCH isn't overtaking BTC.
Its all bullshit FUD artists enjoying their gains.
I sincerly wish that BTC can peace out for a while around $6500 but it probably won't.
This time next week noone will be talking about cash and bitcoin will be resuming its alt destruction.
I've lost `£1500 so far... you really think it'll climb again?
