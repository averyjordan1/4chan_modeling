Start building wealth.>argue me on this
THE BIGGER THEY ARE...
THE BIGGER THEY FALL
the correct answer is mostly not if you are not rich in the first place.
due to cost of living, high taxes and low purchasing power.
wagecucking will not make you rich or wealthy you will struggle no matter what profession.
Not having a soul is your choice, anon.
