I just transferred 1k worth of eth to binance, and it has not arrived yet.
I also found out that I cannot buy Chainlink with eth at Binance.
Its been 1 hour,and it says I have zero eth at binance.
It's God intervening for you.
Don't buy LINK.
Buy XMR instead.The only way it's doesn't arrive is if you entered the wrong address.
If it gets lost, that defeats the whole fucking purpose of the blockchain.
I doubt your little transaction is what is going to cause the crashing of crypto.
you can buy link with eth at binance
I don't think I used the wrong address, but I live in Australia.
And I use coinspot, because I can not sell coins at coinbase.
Anybody had this problem?
