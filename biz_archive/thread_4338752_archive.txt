Majority of hashrate is in btc, bch will die!>Cashtards logic
 chinese miners switched to btc to bring unconfirmed transactions down so people can liquidate there btc into bch.
Bitcoin cash fork is like 7 hours away... flipenning still a-go, ive been trying to help people on this board all day
You are deluded, no one with iq higher than shoe size wants bch after so obvious bump and dump orchestrated by jihan
Roger ver>Known con artist>Bcashtards>Trust conartists
Jihan and ver are extremely clever, but disgusting people.
Even they understand that there is no point mining bch if it is more profitable to mine btc.
They are after money after all.
