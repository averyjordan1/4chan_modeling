been doing the shapeshift shit a bit because my country doesnt let me into coinbase n others so wondering which one has a low tax on it mainly concerned about bittrex
In my experience, shapeshift.io gives you prices slightly worse than what the exchanges have.
You'll always be paying slightly more for the same stuff.
The problem with Bittrex is that you need to give them your identity and shit to make a withdrawal if you're a new user.
coinbase is shit ass.
you aren't missing out.
Yeah but its just the fact that new coins that i wanna get into like powr dont get put on shapeshift fast so i miss out a bit
