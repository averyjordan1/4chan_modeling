I haven't made any gains lately & i'm starting to get bored of crypto.
I think my luck has run dry.
I'll honestly buy something or look at then the next fucking day it'll moon.
I was just randomly looking at Nexus & it mooned 50% wtf, but I bought vtc instead (which people keep saying it's going to coinbase tomorrow) could this be my big break?
Maybe I was destined for this moment.
And get this- I bought BTG randomly on bleutrade for $100 the day before it 5x on bittrex and i sold that shit the following morning before the moon ffs.I'm so sad right now biz.
May throw everything into bitconnect or cloud mining which will make me more sad because I'll miss out on random bittrex moons.
