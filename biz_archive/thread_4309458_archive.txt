I'm so much of a fucking brainlet I didn't realise that if you close a bad position before it liquidates you get to keep a fucking ton of your money but if it liquidates then it's all gone.
I thought you lose the same amount either way and now I'm fucking fuming because I let it liquidate in the hopes it may turn around last second.
ARRRGGGHHHH
