JUST A VERGEN GIRLLIVING IN A JUSTED WORLD
I did a chart analysis!
This was supposed to be the one dreams are made of
lol, I bought 100k sats of xvg at 92 sats.
it immediately started dropping to 80 sats range.
will probably go as low as 50 sats, or even less (it's worth 0/zero sats in reality).
what a fucking shitcoin.
lol.
thankfully, that 100k sats was only some spare change that I made on some other trade, so I don't give zero fucks.
1000 xvg is all i gots.
never buying it again.
it's just so shitty, you know?
you put some money in it and immediatelly feel chronically depressed.
yeah im hoping some pajeet group will pump it some day in the future so i can drop these bags on some other unfortunate retard
