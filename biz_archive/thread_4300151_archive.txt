Took all my money out of BTC and bought REQNow holding 40k+ REQamidoingright
Definitely better than you'd be doing sitting in BTC atm
You are going to get REQ't mate.
What makes you think this ICO is a good idea to invest in?
I like what they are doingI liked their announcement yeseterdayGood team, no hype... not like OMG hype coinI think REQ bags could be a good hold
Fuck, I am too chicken to sell all my BTC.
I hold about 33K REQ, but want to go up to 100K.
Hope I can make it before it moons.
You're doing it right anonFellow LINK marine here, we the brotherhood
I only hold about 500 LINK Im not sure SERGEY is ever gonna get his shit together and the other day at that conference he looked like a fucking bum.I think REQ might be safer bags
he is getting shit together as we speak, hiring new devs, it takes time to find trustworthy peopleand did you see all the other people at the conference?
they all looked weird like typical nerds wearing flip flops and shit, it's not a oscar award speechbut anyway, good look with your bags I'm thinking of buying some Req too
