fucking bought yoyo at the top when i was only planning to get a small 5% return... when all of a sudden it fucking tanks to -25%fml fml.....lesson learned never touch anything made by the chinese.
Now I'm stuck waiting for these chinks to battle it out in this competition shit for some iphones hoping to get some of my btc back
haaahahahaha
BINANCE KING OF MANIPULATION!
Biggest fucking blunder of my crypto Life.Second to losing 50% from adex pnd
It's a yoyo, it will come back up.
chineese steemit - dont worry It will bump back
Buy $NULS you fucking normie.
Look like a genius this whole week.
Seriously.
Not buying ath again
Just looked it up and actually seems legitSo i feel a bit better
why is everyone shilling nuls?
the only significant event to spark this that I can tell is that it was just listed on binance.
but it's not even in a legit trading pair.
Chinese boards buzzing about it something about a payroll company contract or SOME SHIT.
I dunno either way the chart looks great.
