I'm done accumulating PRIX so I will drop knowledge on you poor anons...A decentralized VPN service is a legit idea and a project coming out next year (Orchid) has TONS of institutional investors and plans on raising 200M.
PRIX is literally trading at a 1M market cap on ED right now (yea you heard me right, 1M market cap).
If PRIX captures just 5% of orchid's hard cap then it would go 10x.. AND it has first mover advantage.
Realistically I see this being a 50M market cap coin (so 50x) when their WORKING PRODUCT is out before orchid's crowd sale..Oh and guess what.. their team has tons of experience in the VPN and crypto space.. and they are dedicated to taking this project all the way.
They already have a successful VPN business w/ K users.This is an easy 3-5x w/ binance listing coming up anon.
You've been warned
