fml for selling at 1.8, im buying back in next red, this is going up to 3k im sure
that would be very, very interesting.
bitcoin will continue while bcore will stagnate with millions of transactions in the mempool stuck because no miner would be profitablethe flippening would be very fast at that point
I sold at 37 fuck sakes.
Fucking sold at 1800
Bittrex just take a dump again?
Bittrex crashing...AGAIN!
