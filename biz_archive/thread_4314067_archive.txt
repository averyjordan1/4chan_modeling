Some of those btc transaction accelerators take payment in bch.
Chinese miners.

wikileaks
How much BCH for a gf like this?
This one.
Basically nothing accepts BCH.Except jihan allows payment for his asic miners in BCH and also miners accept payment in bch for transaction speed boosts on the BTC network.Can you spot the pattern here?
This entire thing is an agressive takeover attempt by the chinks to undermine BTC
just checked, they only accept bitcoin, not bch (dipshit)
