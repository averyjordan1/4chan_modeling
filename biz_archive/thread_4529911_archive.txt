End of the week is approaching, today you are researching for fresh meat.
Here is a quick rundown on your current memes:>CFD is being eaten by worms>POWR has concluded its fireworks and commenced slow bleed phase >LINK may have bottomed but nothings going to pump this anytime soon after that fucking shill blitzkrieg >REQ has thrown his fist through a layer of rubbleNewcoiners will have developed emotional attachments to their bags, those who can disengage this faggotry stand a chance of making it.
Take your profits gentlemen and fossick for your next missions.
You can leave 25% on REQ if you think it never got the pump it deserved, if accumulating kings and princes won't get you anywhere you need 3 more choices that you will be hodling through to January.
Watch the weekend activity and either buy the dip or wait for next weeks corrections.
Remember anons, buy red, sell green.
you copy-pasted it wrong faggot
That is not important
