Is anyone planning on getting in BCH after BTC's current moon mission?
Gonna get btfo.
Screencap this
why would it?
BCH is now guaranteed to grow (faster).
It's already 10% of BTC transactions and only 3 months old.
I wouldn't be surprised to see 1k by the end of the week now.
.1 soon
well this second yes its getting BTFObut I don't understand why... if S2X is cancelled, then BCH is the only viable scaling solution left for Bitcoin, this shit should be mooning
now that chinkcoin2x is dead, bcash is their only other pawn in this game.
they'll "support" it, because it's a bitcoin alt that's already in motion, even if nobody's using it, it's out there.worth holding onto a small amount, i expect it to test 0.2 or whatever the previous high was, simply because since their takeover attempt failed, this is their only way of showing support for bigger blocks.
dear lord
will the coming fork of BCH double my money?
The money will double, yes.
Before the fork already if you are in now.
