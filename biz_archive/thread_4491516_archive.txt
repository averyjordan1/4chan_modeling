Is there an experienced biz member that frequents the margins game?I know I can fucking Google it.
But as you know, it's not always clearly explained.
I'm also in US, so I'd probably need a VPN?I've been trading crypto about 6 months, and have felt more comfortable and become more profitable.
I think I'm ready to at least start weighing options.I'll save this thread and anything I net over 10k - 5% will go to anyone with awesome advice here..Thanks biz.
i don't think exchanges like it when you use a vpn.
where are you trading now?
You can margin certain pairs on poloniex, no control over the leverage though
Dont use leverage OP.
Its there to sucker in poorfagsRemember there are professionals that have lost Billions using leverage
