Any candle stick experts chime in?
Is this the best indicators of a bullish cycle beginning?
(day candles, 2 big red followed by 2 big green)
no all it means is it reversed and there is support down there.
might have hit its resistance on that wick.sorry about your bcc bags
Nigger.
You're an idiot anon.
BCH is inversely mirroring BTC movements now.
If BTC goes down then BCH moves up.
If BTC begins recovery BCH is gonna slowly bleed
No I was never going to buy bitcoin cash, but after learning about the candles Im considering buying tomorrow based on what the candle closes onif its still green Ill go all in... Ive tested this on many charts history surely this will work
All we need to do is shut down bitfinex and get tether investigated.Call your local senator or representative to let them know about the money laundering that is tether
if you've tested this before why are you asking us
If you think that's going to positively affect BCH in the long run and not just tank crypto for another couple years you're in for a rude awakening
Mr. OP-sensei can you teach me about the candles desu?
BTC (aka BCH) always recovers.
worst case scenario Queen ethereum takes the lead and we finally stop getting justed because every pajeet dumps their alts to catch a 10% btc pumpCrypto operates on dog years.
Why are you asking so many questions?
I think its time for you to go to sleep
I dont know anything I only learned this one from a pajeet on youtube who claimed it works 100% of the time and he quit his job.
for the forex.
I looked on crypto charts it appears to work, also bitcoin is going to crash according to the chartys, makes me thinkj
i asked one question, stop deluding yourself and just let go of your bags already
Hey this is OPs little Imotou.
I regret to inform you OP has died in a car crash.
Sorry he cant answer any further questions, RIP to my brother!
ahahahaha
