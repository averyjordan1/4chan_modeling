>A stable coin that can actually be used for real transactionSomehow this is a bad thing?It is supposed to be a currency.
Litcoin has nothing to offer.
It's in a sea of comparable projects.
I don't get how anyone falls for this shitcoin
It's bitcoin with some tweaked constants and a willingness to follow bitcoin's development.I can kind of understand people wanting the tweaked constants of bcash, but bcash was also founded upon the idea of blocking feature development, so litecoin seems like a better idea all-around than bcash.
With litecoin, you get a similar on-chain transaction capacity as bcash, but also with the benefit of a quicker confirmation time, the better pruneability of segwit transactions, the contract features enabled by segwit, and ongoing development.
LTC IS SATOSHIS VISION
It's supposed to be like Bitcoin except shorter blocktimes, higher supply, and asic resistance.
But I think the latter most may have failed since there's LTC ASIC's.
