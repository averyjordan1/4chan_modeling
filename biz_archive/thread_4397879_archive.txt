In case if anyone is interested, I have professional background in Forex trading, for the last 3 years I've worked in an investment company and made them some pennies on the side - Forex was considered a safe option of multiplying the income.Two days ago I've decided to take a better look at binary options and see for myself why they're considered a scam.It's not a scam.
I'm still playing on the demo account, however I'm sitting on around 150% profit a day at this moment.The biggest con I've heard about it that broker presumably has a 5-10% edge on the players, but I don't see that.
I'm still experimenting and trying to decide which strategy is the best for this kind of "trading".
First day I won 61.5% of the trades, second day 77.5% and today I'm at 81%.The game doesn't seem to be rigged.That being said, I can tell that lots of retards are treating binary options as gambling.
The broker I found has a "put/call" percentage list which allegedly reflects how people are trading at any given moment.
And they're usually trading like complete retards, so no wonder the house is making a lot of money on them.What are your thoughts?
All the YouTube people doing this edit their videos and probably take money from exchange sponsors.
How easy would it be for them to give you a lag spike that benefits them?
I'm playing 15m-1h periods, lag isn't really that much of a problem there.
Wouldn't touch the 1s squiggly line most people on YouTube are talking about even with the longest stick.
