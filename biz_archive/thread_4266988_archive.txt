The next Binance moon mission?
fuck raiden all the action is on REQ on binance rn

OP you do realise that Raiden's market cap is already $70 million (2x ico price).
If anyone buys in now they may not profit much off it.
how do you know that?
x from a low ICO; and it's not the average product.Their first product come in mainnet by end of this month.Do your home work and you will understand why his marketcap is nothing now
Raiden is a strong project, but their raise was quite high for what it is now.
Ico buyers already made 2x on this.
Not much incentive to buy at 2x ($70 million mcap) unless there's big news or listing on a top tier exchange to push the price up.
Not saying that it's impossible though, in crypto anything can happen.
>mfw hold REQ, RDN and RPX

Cmc didn't show the market cap

Product released in less than one month

raiden is a good project, but the token is fucking useless.
No way it should cost $2
